<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHY MAY WE BUY KORBANOS FROM NOCHRIM?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Contradiction 3:d, 22b - Ravina):</span> We are concerned for bestiality l'Chatchilah (therefore, we do not leave animals with Nochrim), but not b'Di'eved (therefore, we may buy Korbanos from them).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that we distinguish between l'Chatchilah and b'Di'eved?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> A woman may not be secluded with Nochrim, for they are suspected of illicit relations;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> If a woman was taken captive by Nochrim, if this was due to money owed to her captor, she is permitted to her husband. If she was sentenced to die, she is forbidden to her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Resolution (Ravina):</span> L'Chatchilah she may not be secluded with Nochrim, but b'Di'eved we are not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps (normally) we are concerned even b'Di'eved;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here is different, for her captor fears that if he has relations with her, her husband will not pay her debt to redeem her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Support (Seifa):</span> If she was sentenced to die, she is forbidden to her husband (because her captors have nothing to lose).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Pedas):</span> Our Mishnah is R. Eliezer. The Beraisa that permits buying Korbanos from Nochrim is Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> We may not buy a cow (to use for the red heifer) from Nochrim. (The red heifer is not really a Korban, but many of its laws are like those of Korbanos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim permit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Eliezer forbids because we are concerned lest the Nochri had relations with it. Chachamim are not concerned for this.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE ARGUMENT OF R. ELIEZER AND CHACHAMIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> Perhaps neither is concerned for this. Rather, R. Eliezer forbids due to Rav Yehudah's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Even if one left a bundle of sacks on a red heifer (this is considered work), it is disqualified;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A calf is disqualified from being an Eglah Arufah (to atone when a murdered corpse is found) only if it pulled (a yoke or burden).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer is concerned lest the heifer was used for work. Chachamim are not concerned for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (of Objection #1):</span> No one would be concerned. The Nochri expects to receive a fortune for the cow, so he will not risk this for a minor convenience (resting his sack on it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> Likewise, no one would be concerned lest the Nochri will risk losing a fortune by having relations with it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Eliezer is concerned, for his evil inclination (for bestiality) tempts him greatly!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection #3:</span> Perhaps no one is concerned for bestiality. Shila explained why R. Eliezer forbids;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shila):</span> R. Eliezer expounds "... Bnei Yisrael v'Yikchu Elecha" - Bnei Yisrael must provide it (we read it 'Yakichu').</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This cannot be his reason!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(End of the above Mishnah):</span> Similarly, R. Eliezer forbids buying all Korbanos from Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The above verse applies only to the red heifer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection #4:</span> Perhaps Chachamim permit only the red heifer, for the Nochri hopes to get much money for it, but they agree that we may not buy Korbanos from Nochrim!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">23b----------------------------------------23b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> If so, the following Beraisa is not like Chachamim or R. Eliezer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may buy Korbanos from Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> From Chachamim's response we see that they argue about Korbanos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Chachamim challenged R. Eliezer from "Kol Tzon Kedar (of Yishmael)... Al Ratzon Mizbechi."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Conclusion:</span> All questions against R. Pedas were answered.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE STATUS OF THE RED HEIFER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Chachamim and R. Eliezer argue only about whether we are concerned lest <i>perhaps</i> he had relations with it. If we know that he did, all agree that it is disqualified;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We conclude that the red heifer has the law of Kodshei Mizbe'ach (Kodshim brought on the Altar);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it were only like Kodshim of Bedek ha'Bayis, bestiality would not disqualify it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> In most respects, it is like Kodshim of Bedek ha'Bayis. Bestiality disqualifies it because the Torah calls it 'Chatas.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, a Yotzei Dofen (it was born through Caesarian section) should be disqualified (according to everyone! Rashi - even though it is like Bedek ha'Bayis, it is called 'Chatas'; Tosfos - whether bestiality disqualifies for it is Kodshei Mizbe'ach, or because it is called 'Chatas'.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> A Yotzei Dofen is invalid for the red heifer;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Shimon says, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Shimon allows it because he holds that a Yotzei Dofen has the same law like one born normally. (R. Shimon says that the Tum'ah of a woman who gave birth is the same whether it was a normal birth or a Yotzei Dofen.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yochanan taught that R. Shimon admits that a Yotzei Dofen is invalid for a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - Retraction:</span> Indeed, Chachamim say that it is Kodshei Mizbe'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon says that it is Hekdesh Bedek ha'Bayis. Bestiality and idolatry (designation for idolatry or being worshipped) disqualify it, just like a blemish disqualifies it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - Answer:</span> Bestiality (or being designated for idolatry or worshipped) disqualifies it, just like a blemish disqualifies it (but not because it is Kodshei Mizbe'ach or because it is called 'Chatas'). (End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Ki Mashchasam Bahem Mum Bam";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> 'Mashchasam' always refers to sexual immorality and idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Sexual immorality - "Hishchis Kol Basar Es Darko";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Idolatry - "Pen Tashchisun va'Asisem Lachem Pesel."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>BUYING KORBANOS FROM NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shila - Beraisa):</span> R. Eliezer expounds "... Bnei Yisrael v'Yikchu Elecha" - Bnei Yisrael must provide it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should say that only Bnei Yisrael can provide needs of the Mikdash - "Bnei Yisrael v'Yikchu Li Terumah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is true!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Yehudah):</span> R. Eliezer taught that one must honor his parents as much as Dama ben Nesinah (who was a Nochri);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Once Chachamim needed a stone for (Tosfos - the Choshen, which is attached to) the Efod. They were willing to pay 600,000 Dinars above its value.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Dama had the stone, but it was locked in a chest. The key was under the pillow on which his father was sleeping. Dama did not wake his father, and he lost the deal.</p>
