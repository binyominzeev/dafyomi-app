<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>OIL OF NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Their oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Daniel decreed against their oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It was forbidden because it is put in the Nochri's Tamei Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> One may eat Tamei food!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, it was forbidden because it absorbs forbidden taste from the Nochri's Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Shmuel):</span> R. Simla'i taught that R. Yehudah and his Beis Din voted and permitted it, because Nosen Ta'am li'Fgam (if forbidden food or taste was mixed with permitted food and detracts from the taste, the mixture) is permitted. <span class="note">(<span class="notewd">Note:</span> in some places (right below this, 37a, 38b) the Gemara says that 'R. Yehudah <i>ha'Nasi</i>', i.e. Rebbi, permitted oil. In some places (37a, Gitin 76b) it says that 'R. Yehudah <i>Nesi'ah</i> (the grandson of Rebbi) permitted  Magen Avos (Avos 2:2) says that Rebbi permitted, but people did not accept this, and his grandson permitted, and it was accepted.)</span></p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand according to me, for the Isur was due to forbidden absorption (and they concluded that the absorptions do not forbid);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to you (Rav), how could Rebbi permit what Daniel forbade?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Beis Din cannot be Mevatel the enactment of another Beis Din, unless it is bigger in Chachmah and number (Rambam - of Chachamim that agree to be Mevatel it; Ra'avad (on Idiyos) - and age).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Do not ask questions from R. Simla'i of Lud. People there do not respect mid'Rabanan laws (Rebbi did not permit it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> We can send to Rebbi to ask!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav was embarrassed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> Perhaps Rebbi did not expound the verse, but I will! "Va'Yasem Daniel Al Libo Asher Lo Yisga'al... uv'Yein Mishtav (plural)" refers to two liquids, wine and oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav explains that he put the matter to his heart, and made a ruling for all of Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel explains that he put the matter to his heart, but he did not rule for all of Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did Daniel really decree about oil?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beili citing Rav):</span> The Isurim of Nochri bread, oil, wine and (intermarriage with Nochri) girls are among the 18 decrees (made on the day of heated fighting between Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Daniel decreed, and it was not accepted, and they (Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel) decreed, and it was accepted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav would not say that Daniel decreed about oil if it was not accepted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Daniel decreed against eating their oil in the city, and they decreed even in the field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> How could Rebbi permit what Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel forbade?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Beis Din cannot Mevatel the enactment of another Beis Din, unless it is bigger in Chachmah and number.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> A (greater) Beis Din can always Mevatel the decree of another Beis Din, except for the 18 decrees, even Eliyahu and his Beis Din cannot be Mevatel them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (to both questions - Rav Mesharshiya):</span> The stringency of the 18 decrees (and the requirement for the Beis Din that is Mevatel to be greater than the Beis Din that decreed) applies only if the decree spread through most of Yisrael. The decree against oil had not spread.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Mesharshiya):</span> The 18 decrees are more stringent because they spread through most of Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions):</span> The decree against oil did not spread. (End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Aba):</span> Chachamim checked and found that the decree against oil did not spread through most of Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim (that permitted oil) relied on R. Shimon ben Gamliel and R. Eliezer, who say that we only make a decree if the majority of Yisrael can fulfill it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> "Ba'Me'erah Atem Ne'arim... ha'Goy Kulo" - if the entire nation can fulfill the decree, it is a proper decree. If not, it is not.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE DECREE AGAINST NOCHRI WOMEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beili citing Rav):</span> The Isurim of Nochri bread, oil, wine and girls are among the 18 decrees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the decree about Nochri girls?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> They decreed that every Nochris is Tamei (mid'Rabanan) like a Nidah from the day of her birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Geneiva):</span> All the decrees are due to idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Ada):</span> Nochri bread was forbidden due to their oil...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> Why should the Isur of their oil be more basic than the Isur of their bread?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, their bread and oil were forbidden due to their wine. Their wine was (forbidden) due to their daughters. Their daughters were due to another matter (idolatry). Another matter was due to another matter (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Their daughters are forbidden mid'Oraisa - "v'Lo Sischaten Bam (Bitecha Lo Siten li'Vno u'Vito Lo Sikach li'Vnecha)"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Torah forbids only the seven Kena'ani nations. They (Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel) decreed against all other Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Shimon, "Ki Yasir Es Bincha me'Acharai" includes all Nochrim (all would sway a Yisrael away from Hash-m). How can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Mid'Oraisa, one may not conduct with a Nochris like a wife. They decreed against Zenus (extramarital relations).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beis Din of Shem already decreed against Zenus of Yisraelim with Nochrim - "Hotzi'uha v'Sisaref" (Yehudah was about to kill Tamar for this)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah (i.e. the allusion to Shem's decree) forbids Zenus of a Yisraelis with a Nochri, for she will be drawn after him. They (Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel) decreed against Zenus of a Yisrael with a Nochris.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A tradition from Moshe from Sinai forbids Zenus of a Yisraelis with a Nochris!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learned that if a Yisrael has Bi'ah with a Nochris, zealots may kill him (during the act).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only if the Bi'ah is in public; like when Pinchas killed Zimri. They (Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel) decreed even against Zenus in private.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beis Din of Chashmona'im already decreed against such Bi'ah in private!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> The Chashmona'im's Beis Din decreed that if a Yisrael has Bi'ah with a Nochris, he is liable on four counts. It is as if he had relations with a Nidah, slave, (Nisu'in with a) Nochris and a married woman;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> The Chashmona'im decreed that he is liable for Bi'ah with a Nidah, slave, (Nisu'in with a) Nochris and (if he is a Kohen he is liable also for) Zonah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beis Din of Chashmona'im decreed against Bi'ah. Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel decreed against seclusion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> David's Beis Din decreed against seclusion!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> After Amnon raped Tamar, they decreed against seclusion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> David's Beis Din decreed against seclusion with a Yisraelis. Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel decreed against seclusion with a Nochris.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah forbids seclusion!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> "If your brother, the son of your mother will entice you (to serve idolatry)" - do only maternal brothers entice?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Rather, this hints that a man may be secluded with his mother, but not with other Arayos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah forbids seclusion with a married woman. David's Beis Din decreed against seclusion with an unmarried woman. Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel decreed against seclusion with a Nochris.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE DECREE AGAINST BOYS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Beili said that tey decreed about 'another matter due to another matter.' What did he refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> They decreed that Nochri boys are Tamei like Zavim, lest Yisrael boys regularly be with them, and they come to homosexuality.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> I had to ask Rav Asi many times before he could tell me from what age Nochri boys are considered Zavim (and he asked R. Yochanan many times, who asked R. Yanai, who asked R. Noson ben Amram, who asked Rebbi). He told me that it is from birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> They are Tamei after nine years old (i.e. nine years and one day).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> R. Chiya is correct, for that is when he is capable of having relations.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> Likewise, a Nochris is considered a Zavah after three years old, for then she is capable of having relations (unlike Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak, who said from birth.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we decree about a boy of nine, for he knows to seduce, but a girl of three does not know to seduce, so we need not decree (until she is older). Ravina teaches that this is not so.</p>
