<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Objection: (the Seifa of R. Chiya bar Aba's teaching):</span> If another Nochri stole it from the first, he is (also) killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand that the first is killed for paining a Yisrael. Why is the second killed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must say that a Nochri acquires through Meshichah. (Note - normally, we do not challenge one Amora from another, for they may argue with each other. Here we challenge and refute Rav Ashi from R. Chiya bar Aba! Perhaps this is because Rav Ashi derived his law from Rav, and R. Chiya cited R. Yochanan, and the Halachah follows R. Yochanan against Rav - <b>PF</b>.)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Reuven told Shimon 'if I sell this land, it will be to you.' Shimon made a Kinyan Chalipin. Reuven sold it to Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Shimon acquires it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> He was not Posek!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that one does not acquire before Pesikah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> If a Yisrael sells wine to a Nochri:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he Pasak before he measured out the wine, the money is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If he measured out the wine before he was Posek, the money is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the conclusion?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Mishnah proves that the Halachah follows Abaye!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps normally, one can acquire before Pesikah. It is a stringency of Yayin Nesech to say that he does not acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> A case occurred in which Rav Huna ruled based on the following Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven's donkey-drivers or workers were carrying Peros, and Shimon (who wants to buy) took them into his house, if they were Posek <i>or</i> measured the Peros (but not both), either party can retract. (Taking workers into one's house (while they are laden with the Peros) is not Meshichah. Both Meshichah and Pesikah are needed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven or Shimon unloaded it and brought it into Shimon's house:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If they were Posek even without measuring, neither party can retract (unloading counts like Meshichah);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If they measured but were not Posek, either party can retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Yehudah told David 'if I sell this land, it will be to you, for 100 Zuz'; David made a Kinyan. Yehudah sold it to Moshe for 120.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> David acquires it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yakov of Nehar Pekod):</span> Yehudah meant that if I <i>choose</i> to sell it for the proper price;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Surely, he sold it for a higher price because he was under (financial) duress!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The Halachah follows R. Yakov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>If Reuven said 'I sell this land to you, (and the price will be) like three people estimate it', if two of the three agree, that is the price. (Since he insisted on three, and mentioned <i>estimating</i>, he intends that they should be like Beis Din);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>If he said 'like three people will <i>say'</i>, all three must agree on the price.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>If he said 'like four people estimate it', all four people must agree (since he insisted on four, he does not intend for a Beis Din. He wants many opinions), and all the more so if he said 'like four people will say.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If Reuven said 'like three people estimate it', and three estimated it, Shimon (the buyer) can insist on getting three different people who know the price better.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Why can he do so? Perhaps the first three know the price better!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>The Halachah follows Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Yisrael took a funnel and measured wine into a Nochri's flask, and then measured into a Yisrael's:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a drop of wine could remain in the funnel (there is a place it could get caught), the wine in the Yisrael's flask is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one pours from one Keli into another, the wine left in the top Keli is permitted, and that in the bottom Keli is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah):</span> Nitzok (a stream of water falling through the air), Ketarfes (water flowing down an incline), or Tofe'ach (something wet enough to wet a hand that touches it) is not considered touching, neither Letamei (e.g. if the bottom is Tamei and the top is Tahor) or Letaher (Rashi - to join them to make a Mikveh; Ramban - to be Metaher water by touching it to a Mikveh);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ashboren (a collection of water) is considered connected Letamei and Letaher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Nitzok, Ketarfes and Tofe'ach are connections regarding Yayin Nesech (it is as if the Nochri also touched the top liquid).</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> You infer from the Mishnah. Nitzok, Ketarfes and Tofe'ach are not connections for Tum'ah and Taharah, but they are regarding Yayin Nesech.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Seifa):</span> Ashboren is considered connected Letamei and Letaher.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Huna - Mishnah):</span> If a Yisrael took a funnel and measured wine into a Nochri's flask, and then measured into a Yisrael's:</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">72b----------------------------------------72b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there is a place for a drop of wine to remain in the funnel, the wine in the Yisrael's flask is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The drop is forbidden due to Nitzok (when pouring into the Nochri's Keli (which probably was not clean), a flow of wine connected the funnel to drops of Yayin Nesech remaining at the bottom). This shows that Nitzok is a connection regarding Yayin Nesech!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Chiya taught a Beraisa that says that the case is that the wine in the flask reached the bottom of the funnel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Beraisa says so because Nitzok is not a connection!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. The Tana established it this way because he was sure that if the wine reached the bottom of the funnel, this would forbid the residue;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He was not sure whether Nitzok is a connection.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Huna - Mishnah):</span> If one pours from one Keli into another, the wine left in the top Keli is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The wine in midair is forbidden, because Nitzok connects it (to Yayin Nesech in the bottom Keli).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, also the wine in the top Keli should be forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. The case is, he interrupted the flow (so there was never a stream connecting the two Kelim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The inference remains. The wine in midair is forbidden, because Nitzok connects it (to Yayin Nesech in the bottom Keli).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> The bottom Keli is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The wine in midair is permitted, i.e. Nitzok is not a connection!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The inferences contradict one another. We cannot determine which is correct. The Mishnah neither supports nor refutes Rav Huna.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Huna - Beraisa):</span> If one pours a barrel of wine into a pit (of wine), all the wine outside the barrel (i.e. the wine in midair) is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Sheshes):</span> (It is not forbidden because it is connected to Yayin Nesech in the pit. Rather,) the case is, a Nochri pours. This forbids it. (We can also establish the Seifa of our Mishnah (if one pours from one Keli into another, the top Keli is permitted, and the bottom Keli is forbidden) in this way.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even the wine in the barrel should be forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Nochri's Ko'ach (if he moves wine without touching it) is forbidden mid'Rabanan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim decreed only about the wine that left the barrel.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CONCERN ABOUT 'NOCHRIM' WHO CONTACTED WINE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda (to wine sellers):</span> When you pour wine into a Nochri's Keli, interrupt the flow, or throw the wine from afar (so a stream will never connect your Keli to his)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rava (to people who pour wine):</span> Do not allow Nochrim to help you, lest you let go and he will pour alone, and his Ko'ach will forbid the wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A man was siphoning wine from a barrel using two connected reeds (in a bent shape. After sucking the wine so it begins to flow, all the wine will flow out by itself). A Nochri put his hand on the bottom, stopping the flow; Rava forbade all the wine, even what remained in the barrel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> Do you forbid (Ramban - even benefit from the wine) due to Nitzok?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. This is unlike regular Nitzok. All the wine would have flowed out of the reeds, so they are like an extension of the barrel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Nachman):</span> One may drink from Kenishkenin (a Keli with pipes exuding for people to drink from it) at the same time as a Nochri. (Even though wine that touches the Nochri's lips is forbidden, Nitzok (R. Tam; Ra'avad - of this kind, where the Yisrael drinks wine from a separate pipe) is not a connection.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is provided that the Yisrael stops drinking first. Once the Nochri stops, it is forbidden (the forbidden wine returns to the Keli and mixes with all the wine).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Rabah bar Rav Huna permitted the Reish Galusa (the executive head of Yisrael in exile) to drink from Kenishkenin (at the same time as a Nochri; R. Chananel - with a Yisrael. It is not forbidden due to mourning over the Churban. However, one may not drink with a Nochri, either because Nitzok is a connection, or lest the Nochri stop drinking first)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Rabah bar Rav Huna himself drank from Kenishkenin.</p>
