<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> We learn (that a dented Mizbe'ach is forbidden until the majority breaks off) from "b'Sumu Kol Avnei Mizbe'ach k'Avnei Gir Menupatzos Lo Yakumu Asherim veha'Manim" - if they are broken like frost, they will not offer on them. If not, they will offer on them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CAN ONE FORBID OTHERS' PROPERTY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one worshipped his own animal, it is forbidden. If he worshipped another's animal, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> Whether an animal was Ne'evad b'Mezid or b'Shogeg, willingly or b'Ones (under compulsion), it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of Ones?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Someone stole his animal and worshipped it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to both questions - Rami bar Chama):</span> No, Nochrim forced him to bow to his own animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> The Torah exempts Ones - "vela'Na'arah Lo Sa'aseh Davar" (therefore, Ne'evad b'Ones is not considered Ne'evad)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We would have thought that "v'Lo Sa'avdem" forbids serving willingly or b'Ones;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Va'Chai Bahem" - but one may not (Rambam; Tosfos (27b) - need not) forfeit one's life to avoid transgressing.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> "V'Lo Sechalelu Es Shem Kodshi" - one may not transgress, even b'Ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> In private, "va'Chai Bahem" applies. In public, "v'Lo Sechalelu..." applies. (Tosfos - regarding idolatry, the Halachah never permits transgressing, even in private.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rava - Beraisa):</span> If there was a decree (to publicly force Yisraelim to serve idolatry), a Bimus of Nochrim is forbidden, even after the decree ends. (Even though Yisraelim were Anusim, since they were forbidden to serve, the Bimus is forbidden.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Perhaps they are forbidden lest a Yisrael Mumar served willingly (and idolatry of a Yisrael is never Batel).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> <i>Surely</i>, at such a time, a Yisrael Mumar served!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to questions (b) and (b:1) - Chizkiyah):</span> The case is, one poured wine to idolatry between the horns of Reuven's animal. (Since he did an action to the animal, he is able to forbid it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> The animal was not Ne'evad. It is only Meshamshim of idolatry! (Rashi - a living animal is not forbidden due to Meshamshim; R. Chananel - Meshamshim of a Yisrael can become Batel; Ra'avad - Meshamshim are forbidden only if they were made to be Meshamshim from the beginning; Ramban - the Beraisa said that the animal <i>itself</i> was Ne'evad.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> The case is, one poured wine between the horns of Reuven's animal to serve <i>it</i>. Since he did an action to it, he forbids it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>This is like Ula taught.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Ula citing R. Yochanan):</span> Even though one who bows to another's animal does not forbid it, if he did an action to it (for idolatry), he forbids it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Rav Huna explained R. Yochanan's teaching (what is considered doing an action to it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If Reuven's animal was lying in front of idolatry and someone else slaughtered the Kaneh or Veshet, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source (that it is forbidden)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from Kohanim who were forced to serve idolatry. They were forbidden to serve in the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps Kohanim become forbidden, because they have understanding (but Reuven's animal is not forbidden against his will)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from the stones of the Mizbe'ach. (They are Hekdesh, so the Yevanim did not own them, yet by using them for idolatry they forbade them, and the stones had to be buried.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Papa expounded "u'Va'u Vah Paritzim v'Chileluha" - Yevanim were Mechalel them (and acquired them, therefore they could forbid them).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">54b----------------------------------------54b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We learn from Kelim that Achaz used for idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Ha'Kelim Asher Hizni'ach Melech Achaz... Hechanu (we put them in Genizah) v'Hikdashnu (we were Makdish new Kelim in place of them)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even though Achaz did not own them (they were Hekdesh), because he did an action to them, he forbade them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Likewise, one who does an action to another's animal forbids it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi citing R. Yochanan):</span> Even though one who bows to land (untouched by man) does not forbid it, if he digs pits in it for the sake of idolatry, he forbids it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ARE 'CHALIPIN' FORBIDDEN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah citing R. Yochanan):</span> Even though one who bows to a living animal does not forbid it, if he trades it for idolatry, he forbids it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi and Chachamim argue about Chalipin of (something traded for) Chalipin of idolatry. One forbids it, and one permits it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Opinion #1 (which forbids) learns from "<i>v'Hayisa</i> Cherem Kamohu" - whatever you Mehaveh (make or get) from idolatry is (forbidden) like idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Opinion #2 (which permits) learns from "(Ki Cherem) Hu" - (what you trade it for is like it,) but not Chalipin of Chalipin of it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Opinion #1 uses "Hu" to exclude Orlah and Kil'ayim (Chalipin of either of them is permitted);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If one sold Orlah or Kil'ayim and was Mekadesh a woman with the money, she is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Opinion #2 does not need "Hu" to permit them, since idolatry and Shemitah Peros are two verse that forbid Chalipin;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If two verses teach the same principle, we do not learn to other cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Chalipin of Shemitah Peros are forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ki Yovel Hu Kodesh Tihyeh Lachem" - just like Kodesh transfers its Isur to money used to redeem it, Shemitah Peros transfer their restrictions to their Chalipin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like Hekdesh becomes Chulin after redemption, we should say that Shemitah Peros become permitted after trading them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Tihyeh" - the Shemitah Peros always keep their stringencies. (When a species of Peros is no longer available in the field, one must do <i>Bi'ur</i> on Shemitah Peros of that species in his possession. Rambam - he eradicates them; Rashi - he removes them from one's house; Ramban - he makes them Hefker.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven bought meat with Shemitah Peros, when the time for Bi'ur (of the Peros) comes, it applies to both the meat and the Peros;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he traded the meat for fish (and then wine, and then oil), Bi'ur applies only to the last thing bought and the original Shemitah Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Opinion #1 holds that when two verses teach the same principle, we <i>do</i> learn to other cases, therefore we need "Hu" to exclude Orlah and Kil'ayim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHY HASH-M LEAVES IDOLATRY IN THE WORLD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Romans) Question:</span> If Hash-m dislikes idolatry, why does He leave it in the world?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Indeed, if people worshipped only needless things, He would abolish it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, people serve the sun, moon, stars and constellations. Hash-m will not abolish these and ruin the world due to fools who serve them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Romans:</span> People worship also needless things. Why does He leave them in the world?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> If He would abolish only the needless ones, people would think that the sun, moon, etc. remain because they are truly gods!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - Roman philosophers) Question:</span> If Hash-m dislikes idolatry, why does He leave it in the world?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Indeed, if people worshipped only needless things, He would abolish it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, people serve the sun, moon, stars and constellations. Hash-m will not abolish these and ruin the world due to fools who serve them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, He allows the world to exist according to its nature. The idolaters will be punished in the future.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Similarly, if one stole wheat and planted it, it is proper that it should not sprout (i.e. a sinner should not profit). Rather, the world goes according to its nature, and the sinners will be punished in the future.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Similarly, if a man had relations with another man's wife, it is proper that she should not become pregnant. Rather, the world goes according to its nature, and the sinners will be punished in the future.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Hash-m says 'not only do sinners make a free-for-all of My mintage (they father children in My Tzelem (likeness) from others' wives), they also 'burden' Me (to form the babies) and force me to stamp (My Tzelem, for the world goes according to its nature).'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Roman philosophers):</span> "Ki Hash-m... Kel Kana" - why does Hash-m have Kinah (enmity) against idolaters, and not against idolatry?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Raban Gamliel):</span> A parable explains this. The son of a mortal king had a dog. He called it by his father's name (Ploni). He would swear 'by the life of dog Ploni.' The father will be angry at his son, and not at the dog!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The philosophers:</span> Do you call idolatry a dog?! It has special powers! Once, a fire burned everything in the city, except for the house of idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Raban Gamliel:</span> A parable explains this. Subjects of a mortal king rebelled against him. When he fights them, he only fights the living, and not the dead.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">The philosophers:</span> You call idolatry a dog, and you call it dead?! If so, why doesn't Hash-m eradicate it from the world?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Raban Gamliel:</span> Indeed, if people worshipped only needless things, He would abolish it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>However, people serve the sun, moon, stars and constellations. - Hash-m will not abolish these and ruin the world due to fools who serve them!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Asof Asef Kol me'Al Penei ha'Adamah... Adam u'Vhemah Asef Of ha'Shamayim u'Dgei ha'Yam" - Hash-m asks, because Resha'im stumble in (worship) these things, should I destroy them?! Will I destroy man, because they worship man?!</p>
