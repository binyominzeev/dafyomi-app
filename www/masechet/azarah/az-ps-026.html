<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Thieves came upon Rav Menasheh. He said 'I am heading to Pumbadisa.' When he reached Bei Tursa (his true destination), the thieves realized that they were tricked.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The thieves:</span> You are a Talmid of (Rav) Yehudah the swindler!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Menasheh:</span> You know him? You should be excommunicated!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>For the next 22 years, they tried to steal, but did not succeed. All but one (a weaver) came to ask to permit the Cherem; that one was eaten by a lion.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The thieves of Bavel are so much coarser than those of Eretz Yisrael (who praised R. Akiva)!</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, a Nochris may help a Bas Yisrael in front of Yisraelim, but not alone.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Meir forbids even in front of others. Perhaps she will crush the forehead and they will not see.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> A Bas Yisrael may help a Nochris give birth for pay, but not for free. (The Mishnah forbids, since the child will serve idolatry. Surely this is not permitted even for pay!)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> A Bas Yisrael may help a Nochris give birth for pay on Shabbos, to avoid animosity.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> There will be no animosity. She can say 'we may desecrate Shabbos to deliver a baby that will observe Shabbos, but not for a baby that will not observe Shabbos.'</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu - Beraisa):</span> We do not throw into a pit Nochrim or people who graze small animals, nor do we raise them;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">26b----------------------------------------26b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We throw into a pit Minim (priests of idolatry), informers (who lie to extortionists, causing them to take people's property) and Mumrim (people who habitually transgress a certain Mitzvah), and we do not raise them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> "L'Chol Avedas Achicha" includes the Aveidah (lost object) of a Mumar;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we must return his property, and all the more so we do not kill him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, we must delete 'Mumrim' from the Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we must return the Aveidah of a Mumar who eats Neveilos l'Te'avon (to fulfill his appetite), and the Beraisa teaches that we kill a Mumar who eats Neveilos Lehach'is (to anger Hash-m)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan holds that a Mumar Lehach'is is considered a Min (which was already mentioned in R. Avahu's Beraisa).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha or Ravina):</span> A Mumar l'Tei'avon is considered a Mumar. A Mumar Lehach'is Lehach'is is considered a Min.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Acha and Ravina):</span> Even a Mumar Lehach'is is a Mumar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the latter opinion, what is a Min?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One who serves idolatry is a Min.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one ate one flea or mosquito, he is a Mumar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Surely, this was Lehach'is, and he is a Mumar!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did not intend to anger Hash-m. He merely wanted to taste forbidden food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu's Beraisa):</span> We throw them into a pit. We do not raise them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Obviously, if we throw them into a pit, we do not raise them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> This teaches that if there was a way to climb out of the pit, one should find a pretext to close it, e.g. 'I do not want my animals to fall in.' (Tosfos - this applies even when the Nochrim rule the area. We throw them in a pit only when Yisraelim rule; Ritva - we never throw them into a pit. We only prevent them from leaving).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> One covers the pit with a rock, saying 'I must pass my animals over the pit.'</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A Nochri may not circumcise a Yisrael, for they are suspected of killing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, a Nochri may circumcise a Yisrael, but only if others supervise.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Meir forbids this, lest he tilt the knife and castrate the baby.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Elsewhere, R. Meir permits a Nochri to circumcise a Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If there is no Yisrael Mohel (one who knows how to circumcise) in the city, one should use a Nochri Mohel, and not a Kusi Mohel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, one should use a Kusi Mohel, and not a Nochri Mohel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The opinions must be switched: R. Meir says, one should use a Kusi Mohel, and not a Nochri Mohel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, one should use a Nochri Mohel, and not a Kusi Mohel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Does R. Yehudah really permit using a Nochri Mohel?!</p>
