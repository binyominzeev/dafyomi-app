<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MUST THE 'PEGAM' START IMMEDIATELY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> R. Meir and R. Shimon argue in a case that it initially improved the taste and later was Pogem, but all agree that if it was Pogem from the beginning, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chana - Beraisa):</span> If (forbidden) wine (or vinegar) fell into lentils (or grits), the food is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon permits it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even though it (vinegar) is Pogem from the beginning, the Tana'im argue!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> If one understands the Beraisa, this is not difficult;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is, the vinegar fell into cold grits. Later, they were heated. Initially it was li'Shvach, and later it was li'Fgam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> They argue in a case that it was Pogem from the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he mean that they argue <i>only</i> in a case that it was Pogem from the beginning, but if it originally improved the taste and later was Pogem, all permit?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, do they argue <i>even</i> in a case that it was Pogem from the beginning?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This question is not resolved (now. It is resolved through the Beraisa on Amud B - Tosfos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan - Rav Amram - Mishnah):</span> If Se'or (sourdough, a fermenting agent) of Chulin fell into a dough, and it was enough to ferment it and it fermented it, and afterwards, Se'or of Terumah or Kilai ha'Kerem fell in, and it was enough to ferment it, the dough is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon permits it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even though the forbidden Se'or is Pogem from the beginning (it overferments the dough), the Tana'im argue!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Zeira):</span> That is not considered Pogem from the beginning. Even though it harms the taste, it is li'Shvach in another respect. It enables the dough to ferment other doughs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> If Se'or of Terumah and Se'or of Chulin fell into a dough, and each was enough to ferment it by itself, and they fermented it, it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon permits it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the (Se'or of) Terumah fell in first, all forbid it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If the Chulin fell in first, and then the Terumah or (Se'or of) Kilai ha'Kerem, the dough is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Shimon permits it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Even though the forbidden Se'or is Pogem from the beginning, the Tana'im argue!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We can reject the support as R. Zeira did above!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">68b----------------------------------------68b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If (forbidden) wine (or vinegar) fell into lentils (or grits), they are forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon permits it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even though it is Pogem from the beginning, the Tana'im argue!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We can reject the support as Ula answered this question above. The case is, the vinegar fell into cold grits, and later they were heated. Initially it was li'Shvach, and later it was li'Fgam.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They do not argue when it was initially li'Shvach!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the (Se'or of) Terumah fell in first, all forbid it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> They argue (only) in a case that it was li'Fgam from the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are the three clauses necessary?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, the Seifa (wine or vinegar that fell... ) is needed to teach that they argue in a case that the Isur was Pogem from the beginning;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The middle clause (Se'or of Terumah fell in, then Se'or of Chulin) is needed to teach that forbid when it was initially li'Shvach and later li'Fgam. (We do not ask about when the Chulin fell in first, which we already know from the Reisha. It was merely taught along with when the Terumah fell first);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Why is the Reisha (Se'or of Terumah and Chulin fell in together) needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim forbid when the Isur was Pogem from the beginning, without any Shevach, and all the more so, when there was Shevach!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The first clause teaches a Chidush according to R. Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say that the Terumah was li'Shvach, for it helped the dough to ferment faster;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, since the Terumah and Chulin together were li'Shvach, and later they were Pogem together, the dough is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon should say that the Terumah and Chulin join to forbid the dough!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like he taught elsewhere, that two forbidden foods do not join to forbid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Orlah and Kil'ayim (that fell into Chulin less than 200 times their combined volume) join to forbid it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, they do not join.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A MOUSE THAT FELL INTO BEER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A case occurred in which a mouse fell into beer. Rav forbade the beer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> He forbids Nosen Ta'am li'Fgam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Sheshes):</span> Normally, he permits;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sheratzim (rodents) are different. They are repulsive, and people would avoid them even if they were permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Therefore, surely their Isur applies even when they are Nosen Ta'am li'Fgam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabanan):</span> If it is a Chidush (and we do not distinguish Nosen Ta'am li'Shvach from li'Fgam), we should not distinguish and say that they are Metamei whether they are moist or dry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are Metamei if they are moist, but not if they are dry - ...Sheratzim ...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rav Sheshes):</span> Semen is repulsive. Will you say that it is Metamei even when it is dry?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>That very Mishnah teaches that also semen is Metamei only when it is moist!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> You must say that "Shichvas Zera" refers to semen able to Mazri'a (conceive), i.e. it is moist;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> Likewise, we expound "b'Mosam" (written regarding Sheratzim) - like when they first die, i.e. moist.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Simi of Neharde'a):</span> Mice are not repulsive. They are served on kings' tables!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> City mice are repulsive. Wild mice (squirrels) are not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah is, Nosen Ta'am li'Fgam is permitted. I do not know Rav's reason.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps Rav forbids Nosen Ta'am li'Fgam, and the Halachah is not like Rav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, Rav permits Nosen Ta'am li'Fgam, but mice improve beer (they strengthen it).</p>
