<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE CONDITIONAL GET</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah Nesi'ah:</span> Last night, we permitted oil of Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Simla'i:</span> You will permit even their bread!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah Nesi'ah:</span> No, for then we would be called a permissive Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Yosi ben R. Yo'ezer testified that Ayil Kamtza (a species of grasshopper) is permitted, that liquids (blood and water) in the Azarah (courtyard of the Mikdash) are Tahor, and that one who touches a Mes (corpse) is Tamei (later, this will be explained differently), and they called him 'permissive Yosi.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Simla'i:</span> He permitted three things. Bread would be only your second!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah Nesi'ah:</span> I also permitted a conditional Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven gave a Get to his wife, and said 'this is your Get if I do not return within 12 months', and he died during the 12 months, (since he died before the Get takes effect,) the Get does not take effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Raboseinu permitted her to marry (even if she would have fallen to Yibum without the Get).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> 'Raboseinu' is the Beis Din that permitted oil. They hold like R. Yosi, who says that the date on a document (on condition) proves that it was intended to take effect from that day (therefore, the Get took effect before he died).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba brei d'R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> R. Yehudah Nesi'ah's colleagues did not agree with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar, of a Chacham who was on that Beis Din):</span> Did you permit her to marry immediately after her husband died (since the condition will surely be fulfilled);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, must she wait until 12 months (Ramban - then, the condition is properly fulfilled; Tosfos - this is a decree, lest other women remarry within the year even though their husbands did not die)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The Chacham:</span> Why didn't you ask me about the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'this is your Get <i>from now</i> if I do not return within 12 months', and he died during the 12 months, the Get takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>You could ask, may she remarry immediately (since he will not come), or must she wait 12 months?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> I asked about the Beraisa, because you were part of the Beis Din that permitted that case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> All agree that if he said '(this is your Get) <i>when</i> the sun comes out', it does not take effect until morning. If he died before morning, the Get is void (since it did not take effect in his lifetime);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All agree that if he said '<i>on condition that</i> the sun will come out', it takes effect from now (but she may not marry until morning). If he died before morning, the Get is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> 'On condition that' is like saying 'from now.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue in a case that he said '<i>Im</i> (if) the sun will come out.' R. Yehudah Nesi'ah holds like R. Yosi, that the date on the Get proves that he wants it to take effect from now, this is like saying 'from today if I die' (a valid Get);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim argue with R. Yosi's law (or say that it does not apply here, for the stipulation is not written in the Get - Tosfos). It is as if he said 'this is your Get if I die' (which is invalid).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE LENIENCIES OF YOSI BEN YO'EZER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Yosi ben R. Yo'ezer testified that Ayil Kamtza is permitted, that liquids in the Azarah are Tahor, and that one who touches a Mes is Tamei, and they called him 'permissive Yosi.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Ayil Kamtza?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> It is Shushiva (a long-headed grasshopper).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Chiya bar Ami):</span> It is Susbil (a species of grasshopper).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Papa says that (Yosi and Chachamim) argue about long-headed grasshoppers. Yosi permits them, Chachamim forbid them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Chiya bar Ami says that all agree that long-headed grasshoppers are forbidden (Tosfos - permitted);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">37b----------------------------------------37b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They argue about species whose wings cover a bare majority of the grasshopper: Yosi permits them, and Chachamim require that the wings cover a clear majority of the grasshopper.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Liquids in the Azarah are Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> They do not receive Tum'ah at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> They do not impart Tum'ah, but they themselves receive Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav says that they do not receive Tum'ah at all. He holds that liquids do not receive Tum'ah mid'Oraisa, only mid'Rabanan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim decreed Tum'ah on other liquids, but not in the Azarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Shmuel says that liquids in the Azarah do not impart Tum'ah. He holds that liquids receive Tum'ah mid'Oraisa, but they impart Tum'ah only mid'Rabanan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim decreed that other liquids impart Tum'ah, but not liquids in the Azarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ... and that one who touches a Mes is Tamei, and they called him 'permissive Yosi.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> This last ruling is a stringency. It is not a leniency!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> This law is explicit in the Torah (why did he have to testify about it) - "v'Chol Asher Yiga... Oh v'Mes"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to both questions):</span> Mid'Oraisa, Noge'a (one who touches a Mes) is Tamei. Chachamim decreed that Noge'a b'Noge'a (one who touches one who touches a Mes is also Tamei. Yosi annulled the decree, and ruled according to Torah law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Mid'Oraisa, Noge'a b'Noge'a is Tamei - "v'Chol Asher Yiga Bo ha'Tamei Yitma"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabanan citing Rav Nachman):</span> Mid'Oraisa, one who touches one who is touching a Mes is Tamei seven days. One who touches one who <i>touched</i> a Mes is Tamei until nightfall;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim decreed that also in this latter case, he is Tamei for seven days. Yosi annulled the decree, and ruled according to Torah law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that mid'Oraisa he is Tamei until nightfall?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer - Contradiction:</span> It says "ha'Noge'a b'Mes... v'Tamei Shivas Yamim", and "v'Chol Asher Yiga Bo ha'Tamei Yitma (implying, also seven days), and "veha'Nefesh ha'Noga'as Titma Ad ha'Arev"!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The second verse discusses one who touches one who is touching a Mes. The last verse discusses one who touches one who touched a Mes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Rav Nachman did not explain this way!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava citing Rav Nachman):</span> Yosi ruled that Safek Tum'ah in a Reshus ha'Rabim is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> All agree to this. We learn from Sotah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Safek Tum'ah of a Sotah is Tamei, but this is only to a Reshus ha'Yachid. In a Reshus ha'Rabim, Safek Tum'ah is Tahor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan taught that the Halachah is, it is Tahor, but we do not publicize this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yosi taught that we publicize it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Yosi put beams to show people where is considered the Reshus ha'Rabim (regarding Tum'ah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yanai would tell people (who became Safek Tamei in a Reshus ha'Rabim) to immerse.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BISHUL AKUM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Bishul Akum (a food that a Nochri cooked) is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> "Ochel ba'Kesef Tashbireni v'Achalti u'Mayim..." - just like we may drink water of Nochrim, which has not changed, also we may eat their food only if it has not changed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, it should be forbidden to eat Kelayos (wheat that was dried in an oven) of a Nochri!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps that is true!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> If a Nochri made Kelayos out of wheat, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, just like we may drink their water, which is in its natural form, also we may eat their food only if it is in its natural form.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, if a Nochri ground wheat, the flour should be forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps that is true!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> Kelayos that a Nochri made out of wheat, and flour or fine flour of a Nochri, are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Just like we may drink water of Nochrim, which has not changed through fire, also we may eat their food only if it has not changed through fire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Torah does not say that it depends on whether or not it changed through fire!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> Chachamim decreed against Bishul Akum. The verse is only an Asmachta.</p>
