<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE MUST 'KASHER' EVEN A 'KELI' THAT IS NOT A 'BEN YOMO'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Kelim of Nochrim should not need to be Kashered for use after that day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim decreed to Kasher them, lest they be used the same day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The opinion that forbids Nosen Ta'am li'Fgam holds that even absorptions in a Ben Yomo are slightly Pagum (therefore, we do not distinguish. All absorptions are forbidden, even after 24 hours, when they are very Pagum.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IS 'LIBUN' REQUIRED FOR <i>KODSHIM?</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Our Mishnah):</span> A roasting spit or grill (of a Nochri) is Kashered through Libun;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rav Amram - Mishnah):</span> A roasting spit or grill (on which Kodshim were cooked) is Kashered through Hag'alah in hot water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> Kodshim Kelim are more lenient because they absorbed permitted taste. Nochri Kelim absorbed forbidden taste.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rabah):</span> What difference does it make? In both cases, they emit forbidden taste! (After a day or two, Kodshim are Asur due to Nosar.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> When the Mishnah says that Hag'alah is required for Kodshim Kelim, this means Shetifah u'Merikah (rinsing and scouring, in the Azarah, just like one must launder a garment that absorbed blood of a Chatas in the Azarah. However, Kashering is only through Libun.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Shetifah u'Merikah is with cold water. The Mishnah specifies Hag'alah, which is in hot water!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Abaye):</span> Each Mishnah teaches about the other:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Our Mishnah teaches that Nochri Kelim require Libun. The same applies to Kodshim Kelim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>That Mishnah teaches that Kodshim Kelim require Hag'alah. The same applies to Nochri Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If so, one of the Mishnayos should have taught Libun and Hag'alah, and the other should teach one of these methods, and we would learn the other method from the other Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rava):</span> Kodshim Kelim do not require Libun due to Rav Nachman's reasoning;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Cooking Kodshim in a pot purges the pot from absorptions of the previous day's Kodshim (before they become forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This applies only to Shelamim (which may be eaten for two days), for today's absorptions are still permitted when cooking in it tomorrow;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, if Chatas is cooked today, one may cook in it tomorrow (for it will emit absorptions of today's Chatas, which will be forbidden)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> After cooking Chatas, one cooks Shelamim that same day (to purge the pot from absorbed Chatas). The absorptions of Shelamim will be purged tomorrow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, Kodshim Kelim should not even need Hag'alah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rav Papa):</span> Nochrim do not constantly cook in their Kelim, so the absorptions become hard, and Libun is required. Kodshim Kelim are used constantly, so the absorptions never become hard, and Hag'alah suffices.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Defense of Answer #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> Kodshim Kelim are more lenient because they absorbed permitted taste;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rabah):</span> In both cases, they emit forbidden taste!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Genuine Isur never touched Kodshim Kelim, just the absorptions became Nosar.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>METHODS OF 'KASHERING'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What level of Libun is required?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mani):</span> One must heat them until the surface peels off.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is Hag'alah of Kelim done?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> A small pot is put in a bigger pot (of boiling water).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is Hag'alah done for a big pot?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Ukva had a big pot to Kasher. He put dough around the brim, filled it with water up to the brim, and boiled the water.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">76b----------------------------------------76b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Rav Ukva is a great Chacham. He knows that this suffices!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When Isur was cooked in the pot, sometimes (boiling) drops would splash on top of the brim. We purge the absorptions (Kasher it) the same way they were absorbed. It suffices that such drops splash on the brim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A knife is Kashered by rubbing it on a sharpening stone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ukva bar Chama):</span> Also, he must (Rashi; Ramban - alternatively, he may) insert it 10 times in the ground</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> He must insert it in virgin soil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> This refers to a knife without crevices.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> A knife without crevices may be Kashered by inserting it 10 times in the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> This suffices to use for cold food.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Mar Yehudah and Bati bar Tuvi were eating with Shevor Malka (a Nochri). Shevor Malka cut an Esrog and gave some to Bati bar Tuvi. He inserted the knife 10 times in the ground, cut a piece and gave it to Mar Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Bati bar Tuvi:</span> You Kashered it for him because he is a Yisrael. You do not consider me to be a Yisrael?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Shevor Malka:</span> I know that he would not eat unless I did so. I did not know that you are so particular.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Shevor Malka:</span> Remember what you did last night! (Rashi - Persian women were offered to Bati and Yehudah. Bati accepted, and Yehudah refused. Tosfos - slaves were offered to them. Bati accepted because he was a slave.)</p>
