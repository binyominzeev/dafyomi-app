<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHICH IMAGES ARE FORBIDDEN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> They argue about statues in villages, but all permit statues in big cities;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because they are for beauty, and not to be Ne'evadim (worshipped).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> No one would say that statues in villages are for beauty (all agree that they are to be Ne'evadim, and are forbidden)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, they argue about statues in big cities, but all forbid statues in villages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chachamim say, the only forbidden statues...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he holds a staff (or bird or ball), this shows that he rules over the entire world like over a staff (or bird or ball).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Additionally, they said that if he holds a sword, crown or ring, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Originally, Chachamim understood that a sword indicates a mere bandit, a crown indicates a craftsman that makes crowns, and a ring indicates that he is the king's messenger;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Later, Chachamim understood that a sword indicates that he kills whomever he wants, a crown indicates kingship, and a ring indicates that his seal is supreme in the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel says...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Even if he holds a pebble or chip of wood (it is forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> If excrement is in his hand, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does it mean that the whole world is lowly in his eyes, like excrement?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does it mean that the whole world looks down on him, like excrement?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FRAGMENTS OF IDOLS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one finds fragments of images, they are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one finds a form of a hand or leg, it is forbidden, for such forms are Ne'evadim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Shmuel):</span> Even if one finds fragments of <i>idols</i> (the idols were definitely Ne'evadim), they are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah permits fragments of <i>images</i> (it is doubtful if the images were ever Ne'evadim). This implies that fragments of idols are forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Fragments of idols are also permitted. The Mishnah taught fragments of images due to the Seifa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If one finds a form of a hand or leg, it is forbidden, for such forms are Ne'evadim. (Had the Reisha taught fragments of idols, it would imply that the Seifa forbids only a form of a hand or leg that came from an idol, but not from an image.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one finds a form of a hand or leg, it is forbidden, for such forms are Ne'evadim.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">41b----------------------------------------41b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even though it is a fragment, it is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> The case is, it rests on a base (Rashi - it was fixed there, to be Ne'evad; Tosfos - it is not a fragment. It was made that way.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If an idol broke by itself, it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> It is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan forbids, for the owner was not Mevatel it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reish Lakish permits, for presumably the owner was Mevatel it. He sees that it could not save itself, so he realizes that it cannot help him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> "V'Rosh Dagon u'Shtei Kapos Yadav Kerusos El ha'Miftan... Lo Yidrechu Kohanei Dagon... Al Miftan" (even though the idol was mutilated, they still revere it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> They do not consider it mutilated. They thought that it moved (parts of) itself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Reish Lakish - Mishnah):</span> If one finds fragments of images, they are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Fragments of idols are forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. Rather, it implies that complete images are forbidden. The Mishnah is like R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (against R. Yochanan):</span> We can learn from R. Meir to Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though R. Meir forbids complete images, he permits broken images;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Presumably, the same principle applies to Chachamim. Even though they forbid complete idols, they permit broken idols!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. R. Meir permits broken images due to a double Safek. Perhaps the images were never Ne'evadim,and even if they were Ne'evadim, perhaps the owner was Mevatel them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An idol was definitely Ne'evad (and forbidden), and we do not know if it the owner was Mevatel it. A Safek does not permit what was definitely forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CAN A 'SAFEK HETER' PERMIT WHAT WAS DEFINITELY FORBIDDEN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really true that a Safek does not permit what was definitely forbidden?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Chaver (one trustworthy about tithing) died and left Peros, even if they were harvested that day, we assume that he tithed them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even though they were definitely Tevel, and we are in doubt whether he tithed them, we permit them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> There, he definitely tithed them, like R. Chanina Chuza'ah taught.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina Chuza'ah):</span> There is a Chazakah that anything one gets from a Chaver was tithed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Peros were not definitely forbidden. Perhaps he did like R. Oshaya's scheme;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> One may scheme, and bring Peros into his house with the chaff, and his animal (or himself, if he does not eat in a fixed way) may eat without tithing.</p>
