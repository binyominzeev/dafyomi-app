<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHY WE MAY NOT RENT TO KUSIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it permitted to rent to Nochrim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We tell him not to work on Shabbos, and he complies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Likewise, it should be permitted to rent to Kusim. We will tell him not to work on Chol ha'Moed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Kusi will not listen. He thinks that he knows the law better than we do.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon ben Elazar forbade because people call it the Yisrael's field. Even without this, it is forbidden due to "Lifnei Iver"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the Tana means that it is forbidden due to Lifnei Iver, and also because people call it the Yisrael's field.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PARTNERSHIP WITH NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Some Yisraelim and Nochrim were joint sharecroppers (in saffron gardens). The Nochrim would work on Shabbos, and the Yisraelim the next day. Rava permitted it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina - Beraisa):</span> If a Yisrael and Nochri accepted to work a field as sharecroppers, the Yisrael may not tell the Nochri 'take your share of the Peros for working on Shabbos, and I will take a corresponding (extra) share during the week';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they stipulated from the beginning, it is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they made a calculation (of how much each should get), it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rava was embarrassed (that he erred). Later, it was found that they had stipulated from the beginning (the ruling was correct).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Gavihah of Bei Kesil):</span> Some Yisraelim and Nochrim were hired together to plant new trees. The Yisraelim told the Nochrim to work the trees (and enjoy the Peros) for the three years of Orlah, and the Yisraelim would work them for three other years. Rava permitted it. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Version #2 cannot be correct, for then Ravina had no question from the Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, Ravina brought the Beraisa to support Rava (if they stipulated from the beginning, it is permitted, for the Nochri is not like the Yisrael's worker, even though the Yisrael profits. The same applies here!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava was embarrassed! (Surely, Ravina asked against him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> According to Version #2, Rava was not embarrassed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May they divide the money equally without mentioning the share for Shabbos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If they stipulated from the beginning, it is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If they did not stipulate from the beginning, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We may infer the opposite from the Seifa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If they made a calculation, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If they did not made a calculation, it is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The inferences contradict one another. We cannot determine which is correct.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>NOCHRIM ARE SUSPECTED OF BESTIALITY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may not leave animals in inns owned by Nochrim, for they are suspected of bestiality;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A woman may not be secluded with Nochrim, for they are suspected of illicit relations;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A man may not be secluded with Nochrim, for they are suspected of murder.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Contradiction:</span> We may buy an animal from Nochrim for a Korban. We are not concerned lest it was Bo'el (played the male part in relations) a Nochri, or a Nochri was Bo'el it, or it was Muktzeh (designated for idolatry; Tosfos - and given to the priests and fed fodder of idolatry), or was worshipped.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, we are not concerned for Muktzeh, or that it was worshipped, for a Nochri would not sell such an animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, we should be concerned for bestiality!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Tachlifa):</span> A Nochri does not sleep with his animal, for this would make it sterile. (Other answers will be given on 23a.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This does not apply to male animals!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> A Nochri does not sleep with his male animal, for this would make it weaker.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> We may buy an animal from a Nochri's shepherd (a Nochri) for a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We should be concerned lest the shepherd slept with it (it is not his animal)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is afraid lest the owner find out and deduct from his wages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> We may not give an animal to a Nochri shepherd.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We should not be concerned. He is afraid to sleep with it lest he lose his wages!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A shepherd of a Nochri fears his boss. Since all Nochrim enjoy bestiality, they suspect each other;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A shepherd of a Yisrael thinks that his boss does not suspect him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> Lowly people understand and fear each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why may we buy a male animal from a Nochris? Perhaps she slept with it! (The deterrents of sterility and weakening the animal do not apply.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She is afraid lest the animal follow her around (and people will know why).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Yosef taught that a widow may not keep a dog, nor host a Talmid in her inn.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, she is suspected of sinning with the Talmid. She trusts that he will not reveal anything.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, why are we concerned for a dog? It would follow her around!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People will assume that it follows her because she often feeds it meat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why may we not leave a female animal with a Nochris?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mar Ukva bar Chama):</span> Nochrim often go to other women. Perhaps a Nochri will come, and not find her, and have relations with the animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Even if the Nochri finds her, perhaps he will prefer to have relations with the animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nochrim prefer animals of Yisrael above their own wives.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> When the serpent had relations with Chavah, he inserted filth in her (which passed to her seed).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also Yisrael descends from Chavah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When Yisrael came to Sinai, the filth left them. It never left the Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are we concerned lest Nochrim have bestiality with birds?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing R. Chanina):</span> I saw a Nochri buy a duck, have relations with it, choke it, roast it and eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah mi'Difti):</span> I saw an Aravi buy a thigh of meat, cut a hole (for relations), have relations with it, roast it and eat it.</p>
