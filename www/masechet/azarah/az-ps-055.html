<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHY HASH-M LEAVES IDOLATRY IN THE WORLD (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Agripas, a Nochri general):</span> Your Torah says "Ki Hash-m Elokecha Esh Ochlah Kel Kana" - a Chacham envies only another Chacham. A Gibor (powerful one) envies only another Gibor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Raban Gamliel):</span> A parable explains this. Yakov was married to Leah. He then married Rachel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Rachel is more distinguished than Leah, Leah does not resent him for this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Rachel is less distinguished than Leah, Leah resents him for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Zunin (a Yisrael)):</span> We both know that idolatry is empty. Why do we see people with disjointed bones go to the house of idolatry, and when they leave, their bones are properly connected?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Akiva):</span> A parable explains this. Levi was trustworthy. Everyone would deposit by him without witnesses. Once, Yehudah deposited with him with witnesses. Another time, Yehudah deposited with him without witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Levi's wife:</span> Let us deny the deposit!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Levi:</span> Because he did improperly (not to trust me), should we ruin our trustworthiness?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Similarly, when afflictions are sent on a person, they must accept an oath only to leave at a particular time, through a particular doctor, through a particular medicine. When the time to leave came, the person entered a house of idolatry. Should the afflictions transgress their oath?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Va'Chalayim Ra'im v'Ne'emanim" - the sicknesses fulfill a mission to do evil. They are trustworthy to fulfill their oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rava bar Rav Yitzchak:</span> There is a house of idolatry in our area, that when the world needs rain, the idolatry appears to them in a dream, and says 'slaughter a person for me.' After they do so, rain comes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> "Asher <i>Chalak</i>... Osam l'Chol ha'Amim" - Hash-m was Machlik (deceived) the Nochrim (to let them believe in idolatry) to deprive them of the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "Im la'Letzim Hu Yalitz" - if one comes to Metamei (defile) himself, Hash-m gives him the opportunity. If one comes to Metaher himself, Hash-m helps him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT IS CONSIDERED WINE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - our text - (Mishnah):</span> We may buy a Gas (winepress) from a Nochri even after he stomped grapes in it, even if the Nochri takes grapes with his hand and puts them on the heap being pressed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The juice is not considered wine (to become forbidden if touched with a Nochri) until it descends to the pit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rashi - (Mishnah):</span> We may buy a Gas from a Nochri even after he stomped grapes in it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Even if the Nochri takes grapes with his hand and puts them on the heap being pressed (it is permitted), because (even the juice) is not considered wine until it descends to the pit. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>After the juice descends to the pit, it is forbidden (Rashi - if the Nochri touches it; Rashbam - even if he does not touch it, for he caused it to descend). The rest is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>We may stomp with the Nochri (who already stomped a bit everywhere, for then the grapes are already Teme'im, but we may not harvest with him (for the grapes will become Tamei when they are put in the Gas, and one may not Metamei (or assist to Metamei) Chulin Peros in Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">55b----------------------------------------55b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If a Yisrael allows his Peros to become Tamei, one may not stomp or harvest with him (one may not assist transgressors);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may help him take empty barrels to the Gas and take full ones from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If a Yisrael kneader allows the dough to become Tamei, one may not knead or arrange the dough with him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may help him take the loaves to the Palter (Tosfos - who sells them; Rashi - one may help take the dough to the Palter, who bakes it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Huna):</span> Once wine starts to flow (down the incline of the Gas), it can become Yayin Nesech (if a Nochri touches it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> We may buy a Gas from a Nochri even after he stomped in it, even if he takes grapes with his hand and puts them on the heap.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> The case is, the Gas is plugged up and full. (The juice does not flow. It stays in its place.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> It is not considered wine until it descends to the pit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> Here also, the Gas is plugged up and full.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> After the juice descends to the pit, it is forbidden, and the rest is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to the previous questions - Rav Huna):</span> The Tana later retracted. My law is according to the latter version of the Mishnah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> At first, they said BaDaD (an acronym for three laws);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We may not be <i>B</i>otzer (harvest grapes) with Nochrim, because one may not be Metamei Chulin in Eretz Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>We may not be <i>D</i>orech (stomp) with a Yisrael who allows the wine to become Tamei, for one may not assist in a transgression;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>We may be <i>D</i>orech with a Nochri (who already stomped, for then the grapes are already Teme'im;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>We are not concerned for Rav Huna's law (that once wine starts to flow, it becomes Yayin Nesech if a Nochri touches it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They retracted and said DaBaD (perhaps the second 'D' refers to the second part of the second law. The text of the Bach, 'DaBaB', is simpler);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We may not be <i>D</i>orech with a Nochri, due to Rav Huna's law;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>We may not be <i>B</i>otzer with a Yisrael who allows the wine to become Tamei, and all the more so we may not be Dorech with him (this makes the wine Tamei mid'Oraisa);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>We may be <i>B</i>otzer with Nochrim, because one may be Metamei Chulin (from which Terumah will not be taken, e.g. a Nochri's Peros) in Eretz Yisrael.</p>
