<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FROM WHEN DO WE DATE DOCUMENTS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A case occurred in which a loan document was found. It was dated six years after the current date.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> It is postdated. We should hold it and not allow the lender to collect until the date on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> No, the date is for this year;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Most documents are dated from Yavan's supremacy. This scribe was precise, and dated it from the start of Yavan's rule, therefore the date is six years more than we normally write. (This is more reasonable than to say that the lender agreed to write a postdated document, for then he forfeits the right to collect from property sold in the interim!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> Yavan ruled in Eilam for six years, then they conquered the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> What is the source that the document was dated from Yavan's rule? Perhaps it was dated from Yetzi'as Miztrayim (which was exactly 1000 years before Yavan conquered the world); the scribe omitted the 1000, and only wrote the number of years above 1000.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If so, it is postdated!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> In Bavel, we date documents only from the reign of Yavan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support #1:</span> Rav Acha bar Yakov found a Beraisa saying exactly like Rav Nachman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support #2 (Ravina -Mishnah):</span> The first of Nisan is Rosh Hashanah for kings and festivals;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what sense is it Rosh Hashanah for kings?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is for documents (we write 'in such and such year of King Ploni', counting his years from Nisan).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The first of Tishrei is Rosh Hashanah for years and Shemitah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what sense is it Rosh Hashanah for years?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is Rosh Hashanah for documents.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He himself said that Nisan is Rosh Hashanah for documents!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We count the years of Yisrael kings from Nisan, and of Nochri kings from Tishrei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Summation of support:</span> Every Tishrei we (in Bavel) add onto the year on our documents. If we counted from Yetzi'as Miztrayim, we would count from Nisan!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE DAY OF GINUSIYA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The day of Ginusiya of kings...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1: (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is the day the Nochrim crowned their king.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The day of Ginusiya of kings and the day Nochrim crowned their king... (This shows that they are different!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One is the day that the king was crowned, and the other is the day his son was crowned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> In Rome, the king's son does not succeed him!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> "Katon Nesaticha ba'Goyim" - Edom does not have a hereditary monarchy;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>"Bazuy Atah Me'od" - they do not have their own language (Rashi - they took from other nations; Tosfos - they do not have a special royal language).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, it is the king's birthday.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The day of Ginusiya of kings and (the king's) birthday.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One is the king's birthday, and the other is his son's birthday.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Beraisa):</span> The day of Ginusiya of the king and his son, the king's birthday and that of his son.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (as we gave above):</span> Really, it is the day the Nochrim crowned their king.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa mentioned both the day of Ginusiya of kings and the day Nochrim crowned their king!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One is the day the king was crowned, and the other is the day his son was crowned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In Rome, the king's son does not succeed him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The king can ask the nobles to allow his son to succeed him, like Antoninus did.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>REBBI WAS ANTONINUS' TEACHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Antoninus (to Rebbi):</span> I want my son Asvirus to succeed me; and I want to exempt Tiverya from taxes, but the nobles will not grant both requests!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rebbi told Ploni 'climb on top of Almoni.' He put a dove in Almoni's hands, and told Ploni 'tell Almoni to let the dove go.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Antoninus understood 'I should ask the nobles to let my son succeed me, and I will ask my son Asvirus to exempt Tiverya from taxes.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Antoninus:</span> The nobles are paining me!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rebbi walked with Antoninus in the garden. Each day, he uprooted one tree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Antoninus understood 'I should kill one noble each day, and not confront them all together.'</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rebbi explicitly counsel him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was afraid lest the nobles harm him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He could have whispered, so no one else would know!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ki Of ha'Shamayim Yolich Es ha'Kol" (it would become known).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Antoninus' daughter Gira sinned. He sent a plant called Gargira (hinting that Gar (had illicit relations) Gira).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rebbi sent back coriander (Kusbarta, hinting that he should Kus Barta (slaughter his daughter).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Antoninus sent back leeks (Karti, i.e. should I cut off (Kores) my seed?!).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Rashi sent back lettuce (Chasa, he should Chas (have compassion on her. Tosfos - Rebbi initially meant Kus Barta, i.e. cover up for your daughter. Antoninus misunderstood.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Every day Antoninus used to send gold to Rebbi in leather bags. He told his servants that he was sending wheat (and put wheat on top, in case they would check).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> I do not need it, I have enough!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Antoninus:</span> Take, for your descendants will need to pay tribute to mine!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Every day Antoninus would go through a cave to go to Rebbi's house to learn Torah. He would take two guards with him. He would kill one at Rebbi's door, and the other when he returned. He told Rebbi that no one else should be with them. One day, he saw R. Chanina bar Chama there, and was upset.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> He is not a (regular) person.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Antoninus (to R. Chanina):</span> My servant is sleeping at the door. Tell him to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Chanina found that the servant was dead. (He did not know that he was being tested.) He reasoned: it is improper to return and say that I could not fulfill my mission; it is disrespectful to the king to not return at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He prayed that the servant should be revived. Hash-m did so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Antoninus:</span> I see that even your small Talmidim can revive the dead! In any case, no one else should be with us.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Antoninus used to serve Rebbi. He would give to him to eat and drink. He would ask Rebbi to step on him when Rebbi wanted to enter his bed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> It is improper to treat a king so lowly!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Antoninus:</span> I should merit being a sheet under you in the world to come! Will you bring me there?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Antoninus:</span> it says "v'Lo Yihyeh Sarid l'Veis Esav"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> That refers to those who act like Esav.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A Beraisa says just like Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Antoninus:</span> It says "Shamah (in Gehinom) Edom Melacheha v'Chol Nesi'eha"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> There are "Melacheha", but not all its kings (it says 'all' only regarding Nesi'im), and "v'Chol Nesi'eha", but not all its Sarim (nobles).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Melacheha", but not all its kings, excludes Antoninus. "V'Chol Nesi'eha", but not all its nobles, excludes Keti'a bar Shalom.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>KETI'A BAR SHALOM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>There was a Kaiser who hated Yisrael. He asked his nobles 'if one has a wart on his foot (i.e. Yisrael), should he cut it off and get better, or leave it and be in pain?'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">The nobles:</span> He should cut it off!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Keti'a bar Shalom:</span> Firstly, you cannot wipe out Yisrael - "k'Arba Ruchos ha'Shamayim Perashti Eschem";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Hash-m spread Yisrael to the four corners of the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, it should rather say '<i>l</i>'Arba Ruchos... '!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, just like the world cannot endure without the winds, it cannot endure without Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Secondly, if you did kill them, you would be called a Keti'a (cut off) kingdom!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Kaiser:</span> You are right. However, the punishment for outwitting the king is to be cast (to die) in a house of earth (Rashi; R. Chananel - into a furnace).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>While he was being led to his death, a Nochris exclaimed 'woe, the ship goes without the tax!' (You will be killed for defending Yisrael, but you will not get a share in the world to come with them, for you are uncircumcised!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Keti'a fell on his foreskin, thereby cutting it. He declared 'my property is given to R. Akiva and his colleagues.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> "V'Hayah l'Aharon ul'Vanav" teaches that Aharon gets half (of the Lechem ha'Panim), and the other Kohanim get half. (Here also, I get half, and my colleagues get half.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A voice from Heaven announced 'Keti'a bar Shalom is prepared for the world to come (he need not go to Gehinom first).'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rebbi cried:</span> Some acquire their share in the world to come in a moment, and some acquire their share over the course of many years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Antoninus served Rebbi (like a Talmid). Adarchan (a Nochri noble) served Rav. When each of them died, his Rebbi lamented 'the bond of love has been severed.'</p>
