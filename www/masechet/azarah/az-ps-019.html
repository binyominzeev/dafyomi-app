<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>NOT FOLLOWING SINNERS AND THE EVIL INCLINATION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> "Ashrei ha'Ish Asher Lo Halach ba'Atzas Resha'im" is Avraham, who did not follow the counsel of the generation of the dispersion;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They were wicked - "Hava Nivneh Lanu Ir."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>"Uv'Derech Chataim Lo Amad" - he did not stand among the sinners of Sedom;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Anshei Sedom Ra'im v'Chata'im la'Shem Me'od";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>"Uv'Moshav Letzim Lo Yashav" - he did not sit among the Plishtim, for they are scoffers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Kir'u l'Shimshon vi'Sachek Lanu"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Ashrei Ish Yarei Es Hash-m" - does this only apply to a man?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Amram):</span> No, it teaches that happy is one who repents while he is still a man (with desire and ability to sin);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Happy is one overcomes his evil inclination like a (strong) man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "B'Mitzvosav Chafetz Me'od" - he desires the Mitzvos, and not their reward.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Do not serve Hash-m like servants who serve for the sake of reward, rather, like servants who serve not for the sake of reward.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT AND HOW TO LEARN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Ki Im b'Toras Hash-m Cheftzo" - one only learns (well) what he desires to learn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rebbi finished teaching a Sefer to his son Shimon and to Levi. Levi wanted to learn Mishlei next, and Shimon wanted to learn Tehilim. They forced Levi to agree.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>As soon as Rebbi expounded "Ki Im b'Toras Hash-m Cheftzo" as above, Levi said 'you have given me permission to leave.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Avdimi bar Chama):</span> "Ki Im b'Toras Hash-m Cheftzo" - anyone who engages in Torah, Hash-m does his desires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Ki Im b'Toras Hash-m Cheftzo" - one should learn from the Rebbi from whom he desires to learn (Maharsha).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> When one starts learning, it is considered Hash-m's Torah - "b'Toras Hash-m Cheftzo";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After he toiled, it is called his - "uv'Soraso Yehgeh Yomam va'Lailah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> First, one should learn (from his Rebbi) the text (of the Mishnayos and teachings that explain it) - "bToras Hash-m";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Afterwards, he himself should delve deeper into it - "u'Soraso Yehgeh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One should learn the text, even if he forgets or does not understand it - "Garsah Nafshi l'Sa'avah" (an expression of cutting kernels of grain, but not grinding, which would represent a thorough understanding).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rava):</span> One verse says, "(one should learn) Al Gapei (an unsteady place; alternatively, by himself)"; another says "Al Kisei (in a fixed place; or, to many others)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> At first, one should learn Al Gapei; later, he should learn Al Kisei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> It says "b'Rosh Meromim" (hiddenly); it continues, "Alei Derech" (openly)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> At first, one should learn b'Rosh Meromim. Later, he should learn Alei Derech.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Ula):</span> It says "Shesei Mayim mi'Borecha (a pit containing water)", and it continues "v'Nozelim mi'Toch Be'erecha (a well of running water)"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> At first, one should learn from a Rebbi. Later, he should learn and be Mechadesh by himself (Gra).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rava citing Rav Sechorah):</span> "Hon me'Hevel Yim'at v'Kovetz Al Yad Yarbeh" - if one learns large amounts at a time, without time to review properly, he will lose it. If he learns small amounts at a time, he will grow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Many Rabanan know this, yet transgress it (Maharsha - because they follow Rava's teaching above (g)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> I fulfilled the teaching and remembered my learning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shizbi):</span> What does it mean "Lo Yacharoch Remiyah Tzeido"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Shizbi):</span> One who deceives (he projects himself to be a Chacham because he has memorized much text) will not (remember it, nor) live a long time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> One who learns small amounts at a time (and reviews it often) will surely have what to eat (remember his learning)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Dimi):</span> A parable explains this. If a hunter breaks the wings of each bird he catches before hunting the next (Maharsha), he will keep all of them. If not, he will lose them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT, WHEN AND FROM WHOM TO LEARN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> "V'Hayah k'Etz <i>Shasul</i> Al Palgei Mayim" - it was <i>replanted</i> there, and not planted there. Anyone who learns Torah from one Rebbi will never see a sign of success.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda (to his Talmidim):</span> I am afraid that you will leave me when you hear this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He taught R. Yanai's teaching. They went to learn from Rabah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> This applies only to reasoning, but it is best to learn the text from one Rebbi, lest he be confused by different texts.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Tanchum bar Chanila'i):</span> One should divide his years into three. He should learn written Torah for one third, Mishnah for a third, and Talmud (resolving difficulties between Mishnayos) for a third.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One does not know how long he will live!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He meant that he should divide his days (Rashi - 2 days of each every week; Tosfos - he learns some of each every day).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Asher Piryo Yiten b'Ito" - if one fulfills the Torah, "v'Alehu Lo Yibol" (his learning will endure).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If not, "ha'Resha'im... Tidefenu Ru'ach", he and his Rebbi (who should not have taught such a Talmid) will be uprooted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> "Ki Rabim Chalalim Hipilah" is a Talmid who is not yet qualified to give rulings, but does so;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Va'Atzumim Kol Harugeha" is a Talmid who is qualified to rule, but does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is one qualified to rule?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not before he is 40 years old.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rabah started to rule when he was 18!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There was no one in his city greater than him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Ada):</span> "V'Alehu Lo Yibol..." - one can learn from even the secular talk of a Chacham (what is a proper way to speak).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Verses from Torah, the prophets and Kesuvim (the Divinely inspired Writings) teaching that one who engages in Torah, his property (Gra's text - ways) will succeed:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Torah - "u'Shmartem... Lema'an Taskilu Es Kol Asher Ta'asun";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The prophets - "v'Hagisa Bo Yomam va'Lailah... Tatzli'ach Es Derachecha";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Kesuvim - "u'Soraso Yehgeh Yomam va'Lailah... v'Chol Asher Ya'aseh Yatzli'ach."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Alexandri announced 'who wants life'? Everyone flocked to him. He explained 'ha'Chafetz Chayim... Netzor Leshonecha me'Ra..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If he avoids forbidden speech, perhaps he may indulge in sleep!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Sur Mera va'Aseh Tov";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Tov" refers to Torah - "Lekach Tov Nasati Lachem Torasi..."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WAGES FOR BUILDING IDOLS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When he gets to the dome where they put the idolatry (he may not build).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If he built it, the wages are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious! The dome merely serves idolatry. R. Akiva and R. Yishmael agree that such things are not forbidden until they are used to serve idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> R. Elazar teaches that if he built idolatry itself, the wages are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand this according to R. Yishmael, who says that idolatry of a Yisrael (e.g. he made for himself, to sell) is forbidden immediately, and idolatry of a Nochri is not forbidden until he serves it (the entire time the Yisrael is making it, it is permitted);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, R. Akiva says just the contrary. Idolatry (of a Yisrael is not forbidden until he serves it). That of a Nochri is forbidden immediately. Why are the wages permitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Ula):</span> It is considered idolatry only when it is completed, i.e. when the last hammer blow is done. The last blow is worth less than a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that wages accrue continuously from the beginning until the end (we do not say that all the wages are owed due to the last blow).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>SELLING FOR IDOLS ITEMS ATTACHED TO THE GROUND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may not make ornaments for idolatry: necklaces, nose-rings and rings;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Eliezer permits the wages (if a Yisrael made them). (Tosfos deletes these first two clauses from the Mishnah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We may not sell anything attached (to the ground) to Nochrim. One must sell it after it is uprooted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah says, we may sell something attached on condition that the Nochri will uproot it.</p>
