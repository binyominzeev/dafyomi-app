<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>'BITUL' OF TREES THAT WERE WORSHIPPED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are three laws of Asheiros forbidden due to idolatry:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a tree was originally planted to be worshipped, it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one cut it (leaving the stump) or the branches in order to worship the new growth, if the new growth is removed, the tree is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If idolatry was put under it and removed it, the tree is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> (The tree is forbidden) only if he was Markiv (put shoots into the ground for new growth) or grafted onto it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Mishnah forbids if he cut it or the branches!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, d'Vei R. Yanai taught that even if he was Markiv or grafted onto it, when the new growth is removed, the tree is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that since he was Markiv or grafted onto the tree itself, it is as if the tree was originally planted for idolatry, and the entire tree is forbidden. He teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If one bows to a tree, the future growth is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar - Mishnah):</span> If one cut it or the branches, if the new growth is removed, the tree is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Future growth is forbidden if he cut it or the branches, but not if he only worshipped it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (on behalf of Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah is like Chachamim. My law is according to R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah, who forbids a tree that was planted and later worshipped.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> Why must we say that Chachamim and R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah argue about whether future growth is forbidden, and Shmuel's law is like R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps all forbid future growth, and they argue about whether the previous growth is forbidden (and Shmuel's law is like everyone)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah learns that the previous growth is forbidden from "va'Ashereihem Tisrefun ba'Esh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim learn that previous growth is forbidden from "va'Ashereihem Tigade'un";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The verse discusses a tree whose stump is permitted but the growth is forbidden, i.e. it was planted and later worshipped.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Above, we explained just the contrary (each learns from the other verse)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, we can explain similarly to above after switching the opinions. (The Beraisa did not say how each expounded.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, who taught our Mishnah, which says that future growth is forbidden only if he cut it or the branches?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to Chachamim, it is forbidden even if he did not cut anything;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>According to R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah, if he cut it or the branches, even the initial growth is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mishnah is like R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah. He forbids the entire tree only when it was worshipped normally;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he cut it or the branches, he shows that he wants to worship only future growth, so the initial growth is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Mishnah is like Chachamim. They teach about cutting it or the branches, for this is a Chidush;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One might have thought that since he did an action to the tree itself, the entire tree is forbidden. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> What is an Asherah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is a tree with idolatry under it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Shimon):</span> It is a tree that is worshipped.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A case occurred in which people worshipped a tree, and there was a pile underneath it. R. Shimon commanded to search the pile. They did, and they found an image.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> They were worshipping the image. The tree is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah ask 'What is an Asherah?'? The previous Mishnah taught this (and it gave three examples, not just one)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah means, of the three Asheiros, all agree that two are forbidden. R. Shimon and Chachamim argue about one of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is the Asherah that they argue about? Chachamim forbid even a tree with idolatry under it. R. Shimon forbids only a tree that is worshipped.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(New) question:</span> If we do not know about a tree, how do we know whether it is an Asherah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> If the priests (of idolatry) sit under it and do not eat its fruits, it is an Asherah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> Even if they say 'the fruits are for Bei Nitzrefei (an idol)', the tree is forbidden, for they make beer from the fruits and drink it on their festival.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> The Halachah follows Shmuel.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SITTING OR PASSING UNDER AN 'ASHERAH'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not sit in its shade. If he sat, he is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may not pass under it. If he did, he is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If its foliage was overhanging a Reshus ha'Rabim and he passed under it, he is Tahor.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> The Mishnah teaches that one may not sit in a weak shadow (a morning or evening shadow which is longer than the tree's height).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Mishnah discusses a weak shadow, but if he sat in a strong shadow (a shadow no longer than the tree's height) he is Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, even then he is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Mishnah forbids sitting in its shadow, even a weak shadow.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> The Mishnah teaches that even if he sat in a strong shadow, he is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Mishnah discusses a strong shadow, but l'Chatchilah, one may sit in a weak shadow!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, even that is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Mishnah teaches that even if one sat in a strong shadow, he is Tahor.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he Tamei?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Surely, something under the tree was offered to idolatry. The Mishnah is like R. Yehudah ben Beseira;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah ben Beseira):</span> Something offered to idolatry has Tum'as Ohel - "... va'Yochelu Zivchei Mesim";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like a corpse has Tum'as Ohel, also something offered to idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If (the foliage was overhanging a Reshus ha'Rabim and) he passed under it, he is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the Mishnah say '<i>if</i> he passed under it (b'Di'eved)', or 'he <i>may</i> pass under it (l'Chatchilah)'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yitzchak ben Elazar):</span> It says 'He may pass.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> It says 'if he passed.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>They do not argue. If there is another path (no longer than this), one may not pass under. if there is no other path, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Rav Sheshes (was blind, his servant would transport him. He) told his servant 'when we pass under the Asherah, hurry'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there is no other path, it is permitted. He need not hurry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If there is another path, it is forbidden even if he hurries!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, there was no other path. An important person should be stringent to hurry.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PLANTING UNDER AN 'ASHERAH'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may plant vegetables under it in winter (when its shade is bad for them), but not in summer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may not plant lettuce under it in summer or winter (shade is always good for lettuce).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi says, even vegetables are forbidden in winter, because the leaves fall and fertilize them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> R. Yosi forbids Zeh v'Zeh Gorem (something that results from two or more causes, and one of the causes is forbidden, e.g. vegetables that are fertilized by the Asherah leaves and the soil), and Chachamim permit it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Elsewhere, each holds just the opposite!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> One grinds up (idolatry) and throws the dust to the wind, or casts it to the sea.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> No. This would fertilize the ground (on which it lands). We may not get any benefit from idolatry - "Lo Yidbak b'Yadcha Me'umah Min ha'Cherem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 - part 1 (for R. Yosi):</span> R. Yosi permits throwing dust of idolatry to the wind, for it will be scattered and not fertilize anything (Tosfos; Rashi - grinding up the idolatry was Mevatel it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can we answer for Chachamim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The opinions must be switched.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Completion of Answer #1:</span> The opinions are not switched. We answer for R. Yosi like above;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 - part 2 (for Chachamim):</span> We explain Chachamim through Rav Mari's reasoning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Mari brei d'Rav Kahana):</span> (Even though a hide is worth more if it is flayed from the legs, one may not flay blemished Kodshim in this way, for it is bad for the meat. Even though we want to make the redemption value as great as possible,) the gain to the hide is offset by the loss to the meat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Here also, the gain due to the leaves (fertilizer) is offset by the loss due to the shade.</p>
