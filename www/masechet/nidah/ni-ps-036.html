<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ATTTEMPTS TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Days of pregnancy can complete three months without blood (to be considered Mesulekes Damim and Dayah Sha'atah) that a woman started while nursing. Days of nursing can complete three clean months that she started while pregnant.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she had two clean months during pregnancy and one while nursing, or vice-versa, or one and a half of each, this counts like three months.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Rav, we understand why she must have three clean months (when the nursing is at the end, to be considered Mesulekes Damim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>However, according to Levi, if the blood ceased to flow for a moment, even if she sees blood later, it is from the Tahor source. Regarding Tamei blood, she is Mesulekes Damim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that the blood must cease to flow for a moment in order that days of nursing will complete three clean months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1):</span> Shamai and Hillel (Rashi; Ramban - R. Meir and R. Yosi, who argue (9a) about whether or not a Yoledes who is not nursing is Mesulekes Damim for 24 months) agree that a woman is Dayah Sha'atah after Dam Tohar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand according to Levi. During Yemei Tohar, she did not see Tamei blood.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, according to Rav, why is she Dayah Sha'atah (even if the last three months were not clean)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They agree that she is Dayah Sha'atah during the day after Dam Tohar, since even if she had seen 24 hours ago, she is Tehorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest she saw after the last Bedikah (after Dam Tohar ended)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since we cannot say that she became Teme'ah 24 hours ago, there is no decree of retroactive Tum'ah at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #2):</span> If a Yoledes b'Zov counted her clean days but did not immerse, Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel argue like they do regarding Yoledes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand according to Rav. Beis Hillel considers her blood like that of a Zavah. It is Tamei wet or dry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Why does Levi say that Dam Tohar is Tamei wet and dry?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Tana'im argue about this. Levi holds like the Tana of Beraisa #1.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The case is, the blood did not cease to flow from the end of Yemei Tum'ah (so it is still from the Tamei source).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says that she counted her clean days!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, she was Yoledes <i>Nekevah</i> b'Zov. She counted seven clean days, and the blood started during the second week (and continued flowing into Yemei Tohar);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They hold that clean days of Tum'as Yoledes count towards the seven clean days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> The Halachah follows the stringencies of Rav and Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi and Mereimar):</span> The Halachah follows Rav (entirely).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>The Halachah follows Rav.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DAM KOSHI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman sees blood b'Koshi (amidst labor pains), she is a Nidah (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Eliezer says, if a woman saw Dam Koshi for three consecutive days during the 11 days of Zivah, and had 24 hours respite before giving birth, she is Yoledes b'Zov;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehoshua says, the respite must be for a Halachic day (a night and the following day), e.g. Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The respite must be from the pain, but not from the blood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How long before birth do we attribute blood to the birth?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Meir):</span> We do so even 40 or 50 days before.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehudah):</span> We do so only in her (last) month (of pregnancy).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yosi and R. Shimon):</span> We do so only in the two weeks before the birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Not everyone who sees Dam Koshi is a Nidah! (Perhaps this was during the days of Zivah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> (The Mishnah teaches that even though Dam Koshi during Yemei Zivah does not make her a Zavah,) she is forbidden like a Nidah on the day. (She is permitted the next day. She is not even Shomeres Yom k'Neged Yom. Rashi - she is forbidden today mid'Oraisa. Rashba - this is mid'Rabanan, for if she would be considered Tehorah, people would think that the day can count towards seven clean days.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> In addition to being a Nidah for a day, mid'Rabanan, she must guard the next day like Shomeres Yom k'Neged Yom, lest the pain respite and retroactively she will become a Zavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Dam Koshi does not affect anything.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> A woman who sees Dam Koshi is a Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #3 to Question (h) - Rava):</span> If she sees (b'Koshi) at a time when blood (without pain) would make her a Nidah, she becomes a Nidah. If she sees during Yemei Zivah, she is Tehorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If she sees at a time when she could become a Nidah, she is a Nidah. If she sees during Yemei Zivah, she is Tehorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she saw for three consecutive days, and did not have pain on the third day (whether or not she had pain on days one and two), she is Yoledes b'Zov;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she had pain on the third day, in any case she is not Yoledes b'Zov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The rule is, if the birth came after pain (without respite in between), she is Yoledes b'Zov. If it came after respite, she is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Chananya (the nephew of R. Yehoshua) says, if she had pain on any part of the third day, even if this was followed by 24 hours of respite, she is not Yoledes b'Zov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "the rule is... "?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It alludes to Chananya's law.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE SOURCE OF THE LAW</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "Damah" refers to her (natural) Dam Zivah, but not blood due to the birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this excludes Dam Zivah due to any Ones!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ki Yazov Zov Damah" includes Ones. Therefore, "Damah" excludes Dam due to the birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we include Ones and exclude Dam due to the birth, and not vice-versa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We are Metaher Dam due to the birth, because it is followed by Taharah (Dam Tohar). This does not apply to Ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rather, we should be Metaher Ones, for a man who sees Zivah b'Ones is Tahor (not a Zav)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not find that Ones is Tahor regarding a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Birth is the biggest Ones there is! (It is unreasonable to be Metaher other Onesim and be Metamei birth.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Dam Koshi should not make her a Nidah (even at a time when she could become a Nidah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We should expound "Zovah" -- her (natural) Dam Nidah, but not blood due to birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this comes to exclude blood due to Ones!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Ishah Ki Siheyeh Zavah" includes Ones;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Zovah" must exclude Dam due to the birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> "Teshev" teaches about another case of Tahor blood (in addition to Dam Tohar), i.e. Dam Koshi during Yemei Zivah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps it is Dam Koshi during the days of Nidah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel's father):</span> "V'Tam'ah Shevu'ayim <i>k'Nidasah</i>", but not like her Zivah, which is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Dam Zivah is Tahor when it is seen b'Koshi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since we learn from "v'Tam'ah Shevu'ayim k'Nidasah," why do we need "Damah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Without "Damah," one might have thought that Zivah seen b'Koshi is always Tahor, even if the pain respites before birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>A case occurred in which Shila bar Avina ruled like Rav. When Rav was dying, he told Rav Asi to tell Shila to retract. She is entirely Tahor. If he refuses, Garyei (convince him);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Asi thought he said "Gadyei" (excommunicate him). Shila said "had Rav retracted, he would have told me." He refused to retract. Rav Asi excommunicated him. (Aruch la'Ner - Rav did not really retract. He was a Tana, and he argued with the Beraisa supporting R. Yitzchak, but he did not want his Talmidim to rule like himself against a Beraisa.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Shila:</span> Don't you fear the fire of a Chacham like myself (Avos 2:15)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Asi:</span> No, (the merit of my father will protect me, for) I am (the son of) Isi ben Yehudah, also known as Isi ben Gur Arye, Isi ben Gamliel and Isi ben Mehalalel, a copper Asisa (receptacle into which one pounds. The pounder does not harm it!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Shila:</span> I am Shila bar Avina, an iron pounder that breaks a copper Asisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Rav Asi fell sick from overheating and then from chills; he died. Shila told his wife "prepare shrouds for me. I want to die before Rav Asi tells Rav that I did not listen." After he died, myrtle branches (which were normally put on the coffins) jumped from the coffin of one Chacham to the other, showing that they made peace among themselves.</p>
