<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>TUM'AH</i> OF A MES THAT CHANGED FORM (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> What is your source that a Mes that lost its form is Tahor?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> You learn from R. Shabtai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shabtai):</span> A case occurred in which a Mes was burned and the Sheled (form; Rambam - skeleton) was intact. Chachamim ruled that big doorways (at least four Tefachim wide) are Teme'im (mid'Rabanan, we consider it as if the Mes left through each one), and small doorways are Tehorim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>You inferred that had the Sheled not been intact, it would be Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Just the contrary! Because the Sheled was intact, the small doorways are Tehorim (because the Mes will be removed from the house intact, through a big opening). If not, all openings (of at least a Tefach) would be Teme'im, for each is proper to remove a limb of the Mes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Like which Tana does R. Yochanan hold?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like R. Eliezer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> A Rova (quarter Kav) of ashes of Mesim is Metamei like a Mes (even though the Sheled is not intact).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is it possible that it was burned, and the Sheled is intact?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> It was burned on a hard leather mold. (This kept the ashes in place/)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> It was burned on marble. (This kept the ashes in place.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ravina):</span> It was singed. It did not fully burn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a woman miscarried a hand or foot in which the fingers or toes are delineated, she is a Yoledes. We are not concerned that it came from an Atum body.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda and Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> She does not have the leniency of Dam Tohar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps the body came out (dissolved) many days ago (at least 26), and (after two weeks of Safek Tum'as Yoledes Nekevah, in case the body came out now) the days of Dam Tohar have ended.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef - Mishnah):</span> If a woman miscarried and does not know what it was, she is Teme'ah like Yoledes Zachar or Nekevah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we are concerned lest the baby came out earlier, she should also be Safek Nidah (i.e. without Dam Tohar)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Indeed, she is. The Tana omitted this, lest it connote that (the Chatas of) her Korban is not eaten;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He mentioned only Zachar and Nekevah, so we understand that she brings a Korban and it is eaten.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If a fetus stuck its hand out and returned it, the mother is a Yoledes -- "va'Yehi v'Lidetah va'Yiten Yad." (This is called a birth.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yehudah - Beraisa):</span> If a fetus stuck its hand out, the mother is not concerned for any Tum'ah (due to this).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Rav Huna explained the Beraisa to me. She is concerned for Tum'as Yoledes, but she does not have the leniency of Dam Tohar unless the majority comes out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says "she is <i>not</i> concerned for any Tum'ah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Mid'Oraisa, she is not concerned for any Tum'ah. Mid'Rabanan, she is.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Huna learned from a verse! (The Tum'ah is mid'Oraisa.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse is only an Asmachta.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TUMTUM AND ANDROGINUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman miscarried a Tumtum or Androginus, she is Teme'ah like Yoledes Zachar or Nekevah. (She adopts the stringencies of both. The same applies if the baby lived);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If she miscarried a male and a Tumtum or Androginus, she is Yoledes Zachar or Nekevah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If she miscarried a female and a Tumtum or Androginus, she is Yoledes Nekevah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If the fetus came out cut up or Mesuras (Rambam, Rashi - backwards, i.e. feet first), once the majority leaves, it is considered born;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If it came out normally (head first), once the majority of the head leaves it is born.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When the forehead leaves, the majority of the head has left.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> If she is Yoledes a Tumtum or Androginus alone she is like Yoledes Zachar or Nekavah, and all the more so if she miscarried a male and a Tumtum or Androginus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that she is (only) Yoledes Zachar, due to R. Yitzchak's teaching;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> If the man was Mazri'a before the woman, the child will be a girl. If she is Mazra'as first, the child will be a boy.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One might have thought that since one child is a boy, surely she was Mazri'ah first, so both are boys. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. Perhaps both were Mazri'a at the same time, so the children can be either gender.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHICH <i>TEME'IM</i> MUST LEAVE THE <i>MIKDASH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If a Tumtum or Androginus (Ploni) saw Keri (a seminal emission) <i>or</i> blood, and Ploni entered the Mikdash and touched Terumah, Ploni is exempt. We do not burn the Terumah (perhaps Ploni's gender does not become Tamei from this emission);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Ploni saw Keri <i>and</i> blood and touched Terumah, we burn the Terumah. (Ploni is definitely Tamei);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Ploni entered the Mikdash, Ploni is exempt. "Mi'Zachar Ad Nekevah Tishalechu" commands a definite male or female, but not a Tumtum or Androginus.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">28b----------------------------------------28b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If a Tumtum or Androginus saw Keri or blood, if he entered the Mikdash he is exempt. If he touched Terumah we do not burn it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he saw Keri and blood, we burn Terumah. He is exempt for entering the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is due to "mi'Zachar Ad Nekevah Tishalechu"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Ula):</span> No, the Beraisa is like R. Eliezer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> "Sheretz Tamei v'Ne'elam" teaches that one brings a Korban for Tum'as Mikdash only if he forgot the Sheretz (what made him Tamei), but not if he forgot the Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, "v'Ne'elam Mimenu v'Hu Tamei" obligates a Korban only if he forgot the Tum'ah, but not if he forgot the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chizkiyah):</span> They argue about whether or not he must know what made him Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Eliezer holds that he brings a Korban only if he knew how he became Tamei, e.g. through a Sheretz or a Nevelah. R. Akiva holds that it suffices that he knew that he became Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Eliezer exempts unless he knew what was Metamei him. Here, he must know whether he is Tamei due to Keri or due to blood;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>According to R. Akiva, he is liable as long as he once knew that he was Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav exempts for entering the Mikdash due to "mi'Zachar Ad Nekevah Tishalechu" (a definite male or female);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Similarly, we should not burn Terumah! "Veha'Zav Es Zovo la'Zachar vela'Nekevah" refers to a definite male or female, but not a Tumtum or Androginus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We expound R. Yitzchak's law from that verse;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> "La'Zachar" includes a Metzora. (His Mayanos (bodily fluids) are Avos ha'Tum'ah.) "Vela'Nekevah" includes (the Mayanos of) a Metzora'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also "mi'Zachar... " teaches something else!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> The Mitzvah to expel Tum'ah from the Mikdash applies to whatever can become Tahor in a Mikveh (like men and women). This excludes Klei Cheres.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it came to teach only that, it should have said "Adam." (Rather, it says "mi'Zachar... " to teach both.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Had it said "Adam," one might have thought that metal Kelim are excluded (i.e. they need not be expelled)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Chol Tamei la'Nafesh" includes metal Kelim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Mi'Zachar Ad Nekevah" is needed only for Rav's teaching.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it comes to teach only Rav's law (and does not exclude earthenware)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it should say "Zachar u'Nekevah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it says "mi'Zachar <i>Ad</i> Nekevah," i.e. everything with the law of males and females, i.e. a Mikveh can be Metaher it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so (the verse discusses other Tum'os), a Tumtum or Androginus should not be sent from the Mikdash due to any Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Mi'Zachar" discusses a Tum'ah that emanates from a male.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Mi'Zachar Ad Nekevah" does not always exclude a Tumtum and Androginus!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "ha'Zachar" regarding Erchin (pledging to Hekdesh an amount based on one's age and gender);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Ha'Zachar" excludes a Tumtum or Androginus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps a Tumtum or Androginus does not have the Erech of a male, but he has the Erech of a female!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ha'Zachar... v'Im Nekevah" teaches that Erchin applies only to definite males and females.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> We exclude only Tumtum and Androginus because it says "<i>ha</i>'Zachar" and "<i>v'Im</i> Nekevah." Had it said only "Zachar u'Nekevah," we would not exclude them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Zachar u'Nekevah" is needed to teach that the Erchin of males and females are different.</p>
