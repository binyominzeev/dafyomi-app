<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A PREGNANT WOMAN IS <i>DAYAH SHA'ATAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a woman saw blood for three consecutive days in the days of Zivah amidst labor pains, and on the third day miscarried a Ru'ach or a nonviable fetus (Me'iri - some say, something bearing no resemblance to a child), she is Yoledes b'Zov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is considered a proper birth, the blood should not make her a Zavah. It is Dam Koshi!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papi):</span> (Really, it is not considered a proper birth). The 24 hours are a Rabbinic stringency. Chachamim did not choose to be stringent about one who miscarried a Ru'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> (Really, it is not considered a proper birth); a pregnant woman is Dayah Sha'atah because the heaviness of her head and limbs (normally) inhibits her blood. This applies even if she miscarried a Ru'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If a woman saw blood and (shortly afterwards) the fetus showed, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Ritva:</span> Once she feels that her head and limbs are heavy, even if this is before the fetus shows, she is Dayah Sha'atah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps she is not Mesulekes Damim until the fetus shows, when her head and limbs are very heavy.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rashba:</span> Since she is Dayah Sha'atah once the fetus shows, this shows that she is Mesulekes Damim (at least 24 hours) beforehand, and is Dayah Sha'atah. (Perhaps this is only if her last Bedikah was less than 24 hours before the fetus showed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Or, perhaps she is not Mesulekes Damim until the fetus shows. According to letter of the law, she should not be Dayah Sha'atah until 24 hours after this, but Chachamim were lenient. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> A pregnant woman is Dayah Sha'atah because her head and limbs are (Ritva - very) heavy (which makes her Mesulekes Damim). This is not until the fetus shows.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (An elder):</span> If a pregnant woman did not check herself when her Veses came, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I ask according to the opinion that Vestos are mid'Oraisa. Therefore, without Bedikah, she is assumed to be Teme'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since a pregnant woman is Mesulekes Damim, she need not check. (She is Tehorah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan - Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If a woman was hiding (from an invading army or bandits) and her Veses came and she did not check herself, she is Tehorah, for fear inhibits Dam (Nidah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If not for the fear, she would be Teme'ah. This shows that R. Meir holds that Vestos are mid'Oraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even so, since fear inhibits Dam, she need not check. Likewise, since pregnancy inhibits Dam, she need not check.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW LONG IS A NURSING WOMAN <i>DAYAH SHA'ATAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A nursing woman is Dayah Sha'atah until she weans her baby.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a woman was nursing and her baby died within 24 months, she is like regular women. The 24 hours apply to her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, if a woman kept nursing for four or five years, she is Dayah Sha'atah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi, R. Yehudah and R. Shimon say, she is Dayah Sha'atah for 24 months (even if her baby died);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, if a woman kept nursing past 24 months, the 24 hours apply to her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Meir's reason is that her blood turns to milk (as long as she produces milk, she does not have Dam Nidah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The reason of R. Yosi (and R. Yehudah... ) is that her limbs are perturbed by the birth. She does not have blood until they return to normal after 24 months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Meir says "therefore... "? (Once he said that her blood returns when she stops nursing, we already know that it does not return as long as she nurses, even for five years!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, he said this only for parallel structure with R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Yosi says "therefore... "? (He already said that her blood returns after 24 months. Surely this is even if she is still nursing!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he agrees that nursing inhibits blood, but he holds that in any case, it never returns before 24 months. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A nursing woman's blood turns to milk;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi says, her limbs are perturbed, and they do not return to normal until 24 months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ila'i):</span> R. Meir learns from "Mi Yiten Tahor mi'Tamei Lo Echad." (Only Hash-m can turn Tamei blood into Tahor milk!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yosi expound the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> Only Hash-m can turn Tamei semen into a Tahor baby.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Elazar):</span> Hash-m decreed that one who sprinkles Mei Chatas (water with ashes of the Parah Adumah), or has Mei Chatas sprinkled on him, is Tahor, but one who touches it becomes Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "u'Mazeh Mei ha'Nidah Yechaves Begadav!" (One who sprinkles becomes Tamei.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It refers to one who touches Mei ha'Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> Another verse teaches that one who touches Mei ha'Nidah becomes Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> The verse says that he is Metamei Begadim. One who touches Mei ha'Nidah is not Metamei Begadim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "U'Mazeh... " refers to one who carries Mei Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't the Torah say "v'Nosei... " if this is what it means?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It says "u'Mazeh... " to teach that one who carries becomes Tamei only if he carried the Shi'ur for sprinkling.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that there is a Shi'ur for sprinkling. According to the opinion that any amount suffices, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> That opinion holds that it suffices if any amount reaches the person, but all agree that there is a Shi'ur that must be in the Kli (holding the Mei Chatas).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur of Mei Chatas for sprinkling is enough to immerse the ends of the Ezov (hyssop) stalks (so drops will cling to them, enabling him to sprinkle).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>This is the one Mitzvah that Shlomo did not understand -- "Amarti Echkamah v'Hi Rechokah Mimeni."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHO IS CONSIDERED <i>ZEKENAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Zekenah is a woman who did not see blood for three periods close to her old age.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered close to her old age?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> Other women call her "Zekenah" (old woman).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> Other women call her "Ima," and she is not embarrassed.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">9b----------------------------------------9b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Zeira and Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak argued about whether it depends on her not objecting, or not being embarrassed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these answers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They differ about one who is embarrassed, she but does not object.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much is considered a period?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> It is the average period of women, i.e. 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> It is 20 days (our text, Rashi; Tosfos - 23 days).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>They do not argue. Reish Lakish gives the entire period, including the days of Tum'ah. Rava gives the days of Taharah between periods. (Tosfos - he excludes the seven days of Nidah. Rashi - he excludes also three days in which she could become a Zavah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Zekenah did not see blood for three periods and then she saw, Dayah Sha'atah. If this happened a second time, Dayah Sha'atah. If this happened a third time, she is like regular women, and the 24 hours apply to her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not (only) if she saw at the same interval (e.g. 91 days between sightings), but even if she saw at different intervals.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This implies that all the more so, if she saw at the same interval, Dayah Sha'atah. Just the contrary, if she saw at the same interval, she has a fixed Veses!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Beraisa is like Chachamim who argue with R. Dosa and say that the 24 hours apply to a woman with a Veses.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Still, this is a bigger Chidush than seeing at different intervals. The Beraisa should have said "not only if she saw at different intervals, but even if she saw at the same interval"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Indeed, that is the correct text of the Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Beraisa is like R. Dosa. It means 'this is not if she saw at the same interval, rather, only if she saw at different intervals,</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If she saw at the same interval, she fixed a Veses, so she is Dayah Sha'atah.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WOMEN WHO CEASED OR RESUMED SEEING BLOOD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> Any woman who did not see blood for three periods is Dayah Sha'atah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> A case occurred in which a girl did not see blood for three periods. Chachamim ruled that she is Dayah Sha'atah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> We do not bring proofs from She'as ha'Dechak (pressed circumstances)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was it considered She'as ha'Dechak?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> There was a famine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> She had touched much Taharos, so Chachamim were reluctant to cause a big loss.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A case occurred, Rebbi ruled like R. Eliezer. After he remembered he said "In a She'as ha'Dechak, one may rely on R. Eliezer's opinion."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does "after he remembered" mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He remembered that the Halachah does not follow R. Eliezer, rather, Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, even in a She'as ha'Dechak, he could not rely on R. Eliezer's opinion!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Halachah was not decided like either of them. He remembered that the majority argue with him, so l'Chatchilah one should rule like Chachamim, but in She'as ha'Dechak one may rely on R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The first two times a minor (below the normal age of seeing blood) sees blood, Dayah Sha'atah. The third time, she is like regular women, and the 24 hours apply to her;</p>
