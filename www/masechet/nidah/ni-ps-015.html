<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO FOUND HERSELF <i>TEME'AH</i> AFTER BI'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Ashi - Beraisa):</span> R. Eliezer bar Tzadok asked Chachamim in Usha "what is considered 'later'? Do you hold like R. Akiva, who considers a man to be a Bo'el Nidah if his wife sees within 24 hours after Bi'ah?"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> We did not hear what is considered later. We do not hold like R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> Chachamim in Yavneh said that it is less than the time to get off the bed and clean the area. They are Safek Teme'im. They do not bring a Chatas, rather, an Asham;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If she delayed the time to get off the bed and clean the area, this is later. The regular law of 24 hours applies to her. Her husband is Safek Tamei like one who <i>touched</i> a Nidah (i.e. a Rishon l'Tum'ah);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Akiva says, he is Tamei like a (Safek) Bo'el Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>R. Yehudah the son of R. Yochanan ben Zakai says, he may enter the Heichal and offer Ketores.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We understand according to Rav Chisda. The time to get off the bed is after "later", therefore Chachamim are Metaher;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to Rav Ashi, Chachamim agree that he is Safek Tamei in this time!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Beraisa discusses when she was not holding a cloth. (Therefore, the time to get off the bed <i>and</i> take a cloth is after "later".)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, the Beraisa should have specified that she was not holding a cloth (lest people err)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> He may enter the Heichal and offer Ketores.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though he is not Bo'el Nidah, he is (Safek) Tamei because he touched her in the 24 hours before she saw blood!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah holds like Shamai, who says that all women are Dayan Sha'atan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In any case, he is a Ba'al Keri (one who had a seminal emission. He is Tamei due to his semen!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he had Bi'ah without semen.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CHACHAMIM AGREE REGARDING <i>KESAMIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chachamim agree that if she finds a Kesem, he is Safek Bo'el Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> They agree that he is retroactively (Safek) Bo'el Nidah (if the garment was last checked before they had Bi'ah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah is like R. Meir (who is stringent about Kesamim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> They agree that if he has Bi'ah with her after the Kesem was found, he is Bo'el Nidah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Obviously, if he has Bi'ah with her after the Kesem was found, he is a Bo'el Nidah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Kesamim are mid'Rabanan. One might have thought that just like the 24 hours are mid'Rabanan and they do not make a man Bo'el Nidah, also Kesamim. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we say so?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding the 24 hours, there is no evidence that she was Teme'ah at the time. Regarding a Kesem, blood suggests that she is Teme'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Reish Lakish holds like Rav, and R. Yochanan holds like Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A WOMAN IS <i>MUCHZEKES</i> TO BE <i>TEHORAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A woman is Muchzekes to be Tehorah regarding her husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a man returns from travelling, his wife is Muchzekes to be Tehorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why is the latter clause necessary?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that she is Muchzekes Tehorah only when he is in the city, for she checks herself to be ready when he will want to have Bi'ah, but when he is away, she is Safek Teme'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The Mishnah discusses one who returned within an (average) Onah (30 days) of her last sighting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Huna):</span> The Mishnah discusses a woman without a Veses, but if she has a Veses, she is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Just the contrary! If she has no Veses, we should be concerned lest she saw!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Huna):</span> The Mishnah discusses one who returned before her Veses came. After this, she is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that Vestos are mid'Oraisa. (Mid'Oraisa, a woman must check herself at the time of her Veses. If she did not, she is Muchzekes to be Nidah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> The Mishnah is even if he returned after her Veses came. (Rashi - this is even if this was right after the Veses. Ramban - it is up to 30 days after, but past this, we are concerned lest she saw. Tosfos - he returned more than a week afterwards. Even if she saw, perhaps she immersed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that Vestos are mid'Rabanan. (If she did not check herself at the time of her Veses, she is Muchzekes to be Tehorah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rav Ashi - (Rav Huna):</span> The Mishnah discusses a woman without a Veses based on days alone, rather, she has a Veses based on days and jumping (or some other action);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">15b----------------------------------------15b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since it depends on an action, we may assume that she did not jump and did not see.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she had a Veses based on days alone, she would be forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He holds that Vestos are mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> The Mishnah is even if she had a Veses based on days alone;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that Vestos are mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a woman has a Veses, her husband (when he returns home) can calculate when her last sighting should have been. If enough time elapsed since then for her to immerse, he may assume that she is Tehorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shmuel bar Yeiva):</span> Does R. Yochanan say this even regarding a Yoledes, who is afraid to immerse (for 30 days - Tosfos; Rashi - regarding a young girl, who is embarrassed to immerse)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> R. Yochanan did not permit when she was definitely Teme'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He permits when it is possible that she never became Teme'ah, for then, even if she saw, perhaps she immersed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she definitely was Teme'ah, and we are in Safek whether or not she immersed, this Safek does not overturn what was certain.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DOES A POSSIBILITY PREVAIL OVER WHAT WAS CERTAIN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Safek does permit what was definitely forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Chaver (someone trustworthy about tithing) died and left produce, even if it was harvested that day, we assume that he tithed it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even though it was definitely Tevel, and it is a Safek whether or not he tithed it, we permit it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> There, he definitely tithed it, like R. Chanina Chuza'ah taught;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina Chuza'ah):</span> There is a Chazakah that any produce that came from a Chaver was tithed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The produce was not definitely forbidden. Perhaps he used R. Oshaya's scheme;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> One may scheme, and bring produce into his house with the chaff, and his animal (or himself, if he eats casually) may eat without tithing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> A case occurred in which a slave miscarried, and cast the miscarriage into a pit. A Kohen stood over it to see if it was a male or female. Chachamim ruled that he is Tahor, because weasels are often in pits. Perhaps they dragged the miscarriage away, and he was not over it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There definitely was a miscarriage in the pit. We are unsure whether it was dragged away, and we assume that it was!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> She cast a fetal sac in the pit. (perhaps no baby was inside, and it is not Tamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It says that a Kohen looked to see if it was a male or female!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, he looked to see whether or not it was a miscarriage; and if it was a miscarriage, whether it was male or female.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Since weasels are in the pit, certainly they dragged it away.</p>
