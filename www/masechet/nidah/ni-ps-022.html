<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>BLOOD THAT LEAVES IN A TUBE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Abaye):</span> No, all agree that if blood leaves in a tube, she is Tehorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue only when it left in a convoluted piece. R. Eliezer holds that it is normal for blood to leave this way, so it is considered Dam Nidah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim hold that it is not normal for blood to leave this way, therefore it is not Dam Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Rava):</span> No, all agree that it is not normal for blood to leave this way and that she is not Nidah. They argue about whether all blood from the Makor is Tamei:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer holds that all blood from the Makor is Tamei. (It is Metamei her and anything else it touches, like a Sheretz);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim hold that since the blood does not make her Nidah, it itself is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SEMEN THAT LEAVES UNNATURALLY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> If a thin chip of wood (Me'iri - tube) was inserted into the Ever and semen came out through it, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps "Mimenu" teaches that he is Tamei only if it leaves due to him, but not due to something external;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps "Mimenu" teaches only that he is not Tamei until the semen leaves him, but it does not matter how it leaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - Answer (Rav Huna):</span> He is not Tamei unless the semen fills the opening of the Ever. Here, it did not fill the opening (because the chip was there)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Since there is a minimal quantity, this shows that he receives Tum'ah from the semen. He is not Tamei just because he expelled semen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - Answer (Rav Huna):</span> He is not Tamei until the semen touches the opening of the Ever. (Until then, it is Tum'as Beis ha'Setarim);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This shows that he receives Tum'ah from the semen. He is not Tamei just because he expelled semen. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> (A Zav must count seven (consecutive) days without Zivah before he can become Tahor.) If Keri (an emission of semen) is Metamei only because it touches him, it should not be Soser (invalidate the day from counting towards the seven, just like touching other Tum'os is not Soser)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Zos Toras ha'Zav va'Asher Tetzei Mimenu Shichvas Zera" equates Zivah and Keri. Just like Zivah is Soser, also Keri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> Keri is Soser because there are always drops of Zivah mixed in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> If so, it should disqualify the days counted (and require him to count seven days from the beginning), like Zivah does!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Zos Toras ha'Zav... " teaches that just like Zivah is Soser, also Keri.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should disqualify the days counted, like Zivah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Letam'ah Vah" teaches that Keri is Soser only as much as it itself is Metamei, i.e. one day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> The Torah decreed that pure Zivah disqualifies the days counted. Drops of Zivah mixed in with Keri are Soser only that day.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DRY BLOOD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> If a clump of dry blood left her Ervah, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Ki Yazov Zov Damah" discusses a flow. Dry blood does not flow;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps the Torah merely gives the normal case, but she is Tamei even if it cannot flow?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar - Mishnah):</span> Dam Nidah and flesh of a Mes are Teme'im wet or dry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> That is when they were originally wet. I knew that;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I ask about when they were dry from the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Elazar - Mishnah):</span> If a woman miscarried a scab, hair, earth or red mosquitoes, she should put them in water. If they dissolve, she is Nidah. (Earth was dry from the beginning!)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, she should be Nidah even if they do not dissolve!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> If they do not dissolve, this shows that they were not blood, rather, creations.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it possible for a woman to miscarry such things?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok):</span> On two occasions, my father went to (the Sanhedrin in exile in) Yavneh to get rulings. A certain woman used to miscarry red scabs. My father asked Chachamim, who asked doctors. They said that the scabs are from a wound inside;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim said that she should put them in water. If they dissolve, she is Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A certain woman used to miscarry red hairs. My father asked Chachamim, who asked doctors. They said that the hairs are from a wart inside;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> We put these things in warm water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> She should put them in warm water;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, she should squash them in spit on her fingernail. (If they dissolve, she is Nidah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> If they dissolve only when pressed, R. Shimon is Metamei, and Chachamim are Metaher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (Sheratzim and Nevelos are Metamei if they are moist, but not if they are dry. If they can return to being moist through soaking them, they are considered moist.) They should be soaked in warm water for 24 hours.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must we soak also these miscarriages for 24 hours?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sheratzim and Nevelos are hard, so they must be soaked for 24 hours, but miscarried blood (in the form of a scab or... ) is soft, so less time is needed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps we do not distinguish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MISCARRYING CREATURES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman miscarried something resembling fish... .</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah should argue also here! (He should say that she is a Nidah whether or not we saw blood come out with them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> Indeed, he argues also here.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> R. Yehudah agrees in this case;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah is Metamei only regarding a piece of flesh, for blood often hardens and forms a piece, but it would not form a (fish or other) creature.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (This is like Version #1 above (21a). R. Yehudah and Chachamim argue about whether or not the piece is blood. However,) according to Version #2 (21b), R. Yochanan said that they argue about whether or not the womb can open without blood, and R. Yehudah should argue also here!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Version #2 above holds (like Version #2 below) that R. Yochanan indeed says so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (Reish Lakish and R. Yochanan):</span> Indeed, he argues also here. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If a woman miscarried something resembling a Behemah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> R. Meir learns a Gezeirah Shavah "Yetzirah-Yetzirah." (Yetzirah (forming) is written regarding the creation of man and of animals. Just like there is Tum'as Yoledes for giving birth to a person, also for giving birth to an animal.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he should say that there is Tum'as Yoledes also for miscarrying a Tanin (a giant sea creature, or for any fish), for it says "va'Yivra Elokim Es ha'Taninim"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn Yetzirah from Yetzirah through a Gezeirah Shavah, but not "Beri'ah" from Yetzirah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> A Gezeirah Shavah may be learned even from a different word altogether!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "<i>V'Shav</i> ha'Kohen... ; <i>u'Va</i> ha'Kohen" (a Gezeirah Shavah) equates the law (of a house with Tzara'as) when the Kohen (first) returns with when he comes (another week later).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> He should learn a Gezeirah Shavah "Beri'ah-Beri'ah". Regarding man, it says also "va'Yivra Elokim Es ha'Adam"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Va'Yivra" teaches about the creation. Yetzirah is extra, so we use it for the Gezeirah Shavah "Yetzirah-Yetzirah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Yetzirah teaches about the creation, and va'Yivra is extra for the Gezeirah Shavah "Beri'ah-Beri'ah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "Yetzirah-Yetzirah," for these words are extra regarding man and animals;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not learn from "Beri'ah-Beri'ah," for even if it were extra regarding man, it is not extra regarding fish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Yetzirah extra regarding animals?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "va'Ya'as Elokim Es Chayas ha'Aretz," and it also says "va'Yitzer Hash-m... Kol Chayas ha'Sadeh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, Beri'ah should be extra regarding Taninim! It says "(va'Ya'as)... v'Es Kol Remes ha'Adamah," and it says also "va'Yivra Elokim Es ha'Taninim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In that verse, "Remes" refers to things that swarm on land.</p>
