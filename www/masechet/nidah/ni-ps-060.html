<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ON WHOM ARE WE TOLEH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> She may be Toleh only on an (adult) Nochris who already saw Dam Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Presumably, the case of a Nochris is like a Nidah (with which it is taught), i.e. she already saw.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Sheshes):</span> Rav must have been sleeping when he said that!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> She may be Toleh on a Nochris;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir says, she may be Toleh (only) on a Nochris old enough (that it is common for her) to see Dam Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Even R. Meir requires only that she is old enough to see, but not that she actually saw!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> You understand that R. Meir is more stringent than Chachamim. He is more lenient! (Rav holds like Chachamim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> She may not be Toleh on a Nochris;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir says, she may be Toleh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Resolution (Rava):</span> Beraisa #1 means that (Chachamim say that) she may be Toleh on a Nochris who has seen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Meir says, she may be Toleh on a Nochris old enough to see, even if she did not see.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> A (Tahor) woman may be Toleh on a Shomeres Yom k'Neged Yom on the day after she saw, or on a Zavah counting seven clean days who did not immerse yet. (Rashi - we are Toleh on the one more prone to see. Rashba - we are Toleh on the Teme'ah, for she will not lose). Therefore, the Tehorah remains Tehorah, and the other woman is Mekulkeles (in Safek).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rebbi says, she may not be Toleh. Therefore, both women are Mekulkalos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All agree that she may be Toleh on a Shomeres Yom k'Neged Yom on the day she saw, or on a woman during Yemei Tohar, or on a Besulah (who just got married. Her blood (Dam Besulim) is Tahor).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did R. Shimon ben Gamliel say "therefore, (she remains Tehorah... )"? (This follows from what he already said!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is for parallel structure with Rebbi (who said "therefore... ").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Rebbi says "therefore... "?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the one who found the Kesem is Mekulkeles, but not the lender.  He teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Rebbi and R. Shimon ben Gamliel would argue also about a Tahor and a Tamei who walked on two paths. (One path has Tum'ah underneath that is Metamei anyone who traverses the path. We do not know which path each traversed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ada):</span> Rebbi is Metamei both women only when they are similar. (I.e. the Teme'ah may immerse now if she wants, i.e. a Shomeres Yom on day two or a Zavah on her seventh clean day. It is as if both are Tehoros);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, the Tamei does not lose if we are Toleh that he walked on the Tamei path! (Tosfos - he had not received Haza'as Mei Chatas on days three and seven. Since he was not ready to immerse, it is not considered a loss. Tosfos ha'Rosh - normally, we are Metaher each man due to Safek Tum'ah in Reshus ha'Rabim. We are Toleh on the Tamei only if both men ask Beis Din together, for then we cannot be Metaher both of them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Chisda holds that also the women are not so similar. The Shomeres Yom is not Tehorah until she immerses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> If a Tahor and one who was Tamei or Taluy (Safek Tamei) walked on the two paths, all agree that we are Toleh that the Tahor walked on the Tahor path, and the Tamei or Taluy on the Tamei path.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TELIYAH ON A KESEM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> May a Tehorah be Toleh a Kesem on (a woman who is Tamei mid'Rabanan because she found) a Kesem?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He does not ask according to Rebbi. (In some cases) Rebbi does not allow Teliyah on a woman who properly saw blood, and all the more so not on one who only found a Kesem!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The question is according to R. Shimon ben Gamliel. He is Toleh on women who properly saw blood. He would not be Toleh on one who only found a Kesem;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Or, perhaps there is no distinction!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah bar Livai):</span> She may not be Toleh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is because she may not be Toleh. (Perhaps the other woman did not see blood, and her Kesem came from elsewhere. Aruch - we have a tradition about this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One may not Toleh a Kesem on a Kesem;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Rachel lent a garment to a Nochris or a woman (Leah) "sitting" on (conducting like a Safek Teme'ah due to) a Kesem, and found a Kesem on it later, she is Toleh (the Kesem on the borrower. Ramban - since blood is not Metamei the borrower, she does not pay attention to Hargashos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa contradicts itself! First it says that one may not be Toleh a Kesem on a Kesem, and then it says that one may!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Reisha is Rebbi, and the Seifa is R. Shimon ben Gamliel. (Answers 1 through 3 are all difficult for R. Yehudah bar Livai, who said that even R. Shimon ben Gamliel is not Toleh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The entire Beraisa is Rebbi. In the Seifa, Leah found a Kesem that same day. (We are Toleh on her, for it does not affect her at all.) In the Reisha, she found a Kesem the previous day. (We are not Toleh, for it would force Leah to wait another day before immersing. We retract from premise (a:1) that Rebbi would never be Toleh on a Kesem.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> The entire Beraisa is R. Shimon ben Gamliel;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">60b----------------------------------------60b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Tosfos):</span> In the Seifa, Leah found a Kesem before she and Rachel wore the borrowed garment. In the Reisha she found a Kesem after they wore it (and a Kesem was found in it).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi):</span> The Seifa discusses retroactive Tum'ah (regarding Taharos touched from when she wore the garment. We are Toleh on Leah, for she was Teme'ah anyway due to her Kesem). The Reisha discusses Tum'ah from now and onwards. (We are not Toleh, for it would delay Leah's immersion). (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> All of these answers refute R. Yehudah bar Livai!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer (and Answer #4 to Question e:2 - Ravina):</span> It means that if Rachel lent a garment to a Nochris (who properly saw blood), the one who found the Kesem (Rachel) may be Toleh on her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashba) Answer (and Answer #4 - Ravina):</span> It means, if she lent a garment to a Nochris who found a Kesem, she may be Toleh on her. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says 'or one <i>sitting</i> on a Kesem'! (This connotes that the Kesem was Metamei her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It (Rashba - Ravina) means, if she lent a garment to a Nochris or a woman "sitting" amidst Yemei Tohar, the one who found the Kesem may be Toleh on her.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE HALACHAH FOLLOWS R. NECHEMYAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Nechemyah):</span> If they sat... (Kesamim apply only to things that are Mekabel Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Masnah):</span> He learns from "v'Nikasah la'Aretz Teshev" -- once she sits on the ground, she is clear (of Kesamim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> R. Nechemyah is Metaher even a Kesem found on the back of a Kli Cheres.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious! (Klei Cheres are not Mekabel Tum'ah from the back.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he decrees Tum'ah due to a Kesem found inside. Rav Huna teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> R. Nechemyah is Metaher a Kesem found on a rag less than three by three (fingerbreadths), for it is not useful for rich or poor (even though it can be Mekabel Tum'ah through designation).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chiya bar Rav Masnah citing Rav):</span> The Halachah follows R. Nechemyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman):</span> My father taught that a case occurred and Chachamim were Metamei (unlike R. Nechemyah). Surely, this is the Halachah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If two women were grinding with a hand grinder, and blood was found under the one further inside or in between them, both are Teme'os;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If blood was found under the outer woman, she is Teme'ah, and the other is Tehorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A case occurred in which blood was found on the edge of the bathtub and on an olive leaf. Chachamim were Metamei (the women involved, even though a leaf is not Mekabel Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about this. (Another Tana says that a case occurred and Chachamim were Metaher, like R. Nechemyah):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yakov):</span> (If a woman found a Kesem on something that is not Mekabel Tum'ah,) she is Teme'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Nechemyah is Metaher;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>(A case occurred, and) Chachamim ruled like R. Nechemyah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHEN WOMEN MAY BE <i>TOLEH</i> ON EACH OTHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If three women slept in a bed and blood was found under one of them, all of them are Teme'os;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Leah checked and found that she is Teme'ah, the others are Tehoros;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The women may be Toleh on each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If they were not fit to see blood, we consider them to be fit to see.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> (The others are Tehoros) only if Leah checked herself within Shi'ur Veses. (She was holding an Ed and wiped herself immediately after the blood was found.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>He holds like Bar Pada, who says that whenever there is a Chiyuv Chatas for Bi'ah (she found blood within Shi'ur Veses afterwards), in a corresponding case of Taharos (that she touched), they are (fully) Teme'os. (We burn them);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Whenever there is a Chiyuv Asham Taluy (i.e. she found blood after Shi'ur Veses but within the time it takes to descend from the bed and clean herself), Taharos are Teluyos (Safek Teme'os. We neither eat nor burn them);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Whenever there is no Chiyuv for Bi'ah (she found blood after the longer Shi'ur), Taharos are Tehoros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> Even when there is a Chiyuv Chatas, Taharos are Teluyos:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Presumably, the blood already left the Makor during Bi'ah, but it could not leave (her body) until the Ever left (therefore, they bring Chata'os). However, regarding a woman who touched Taharos, nothing holds in the blood. (Presumably, it left the Makor just before it was found. It is a mere stringency mid'Rabanan that Taharos she touched up to 24 hours ago are Teluyos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">R. Yirmeyah:</span> The following is a parable for R. Oshaya's reasoning. A child and an elder walked together on the road. The child would wait for the elder;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Once they reached the city, the child rushed to his house. (Likewise, when blood is not blocked by the Ever, it leaves right away.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> The following is a parable for R. Oshaya's reasoning. If one sticks a finger in an eye, it does not tear until the finger is removed, but then it tears quickly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The women may be Toleh on each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The women may be Toleh on each other in the following cases:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one woman was pregnant, nursing, old (missed three periods) or Besulah (i.e. has not yet seen Dam Nidah. Normally, all of these do not see blood), and the other woman was "regular," the former may Toleh on the latter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>If both women were pregnant, nursing, old or Besulah, both are Teme'os;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is the Chidush of the Seifa (of the Mishnah). If both of them were not fit to see blood, we consider them to be fit to see.</p>
