<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHY SHMUEL DISCUSSES BLOOD ON THE GROUND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Ashi we understand why Shmuel discusses a woman who found blood on the ground. (The ground is not Mekabel Tum'ah. She is totally Tehorah.) However, according to R. Yirmeyah, he should have discussed (the usual case,) a woman who found blood on her garment!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel teaches a greater Chidush;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Not only are we Metaher (mid'Oraisa) when it is found on her garment, which cannot be checked so well. It is possible that the blood came from elsewhere. Rather, even when it is found on the ground, which can be checked well, and surely it is from her, we are Metaher!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PLACES WHERE WE ARE CONCERNED FOR BLOOD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it is on her heel or big toe, she is Teme'ah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand how blood could get (from the place) to her heel -- it touches there (when she squats);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, how could blood get to her big toe?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We are concerned lest blood came to her heel, and from her heel to her toe.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We are not concerned lest Tum'ah changed places!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If she (found blood near the place, and) had a cut on her neck, a place where she can be Toleh (that the blood fell from there), she is Toleh. if she had a cut on her shoulder, a place where she cannot be Toleh, she is not Toleh.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>We do not say that the blood came on her hand, and from there to the place! (Tosfos - since Tum'as Kesamim is mid'Rabanan, if we are not Toleh to be lenient, we are not Toleh to be stringent.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When she walks, her big toe often comes directly under the place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Sometimes) we are concerned lest Tum'ah changed places!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If she found blood on (Rashi - the back of her hand, i.e. above) the knuckles, she is Teme'ah, for hands engage in many things.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> (She does not check with her knuckles.) We are concerned lest she checked herself with one hand, and blood came from it to knuckles of the other hand!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the entire hand is prone to touch during Bedikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it is on the inside of her legs or feet...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered the inside?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 Answer (d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> It is until the place of Chivuk (where the sinews clamp the thigh to the lower leg, or where the thigh covers the lower leg when squatting. Alternatively, it is where (garter) loops fasten to hold up socks).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is the place of Chivuk considered like inside or like outside?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Katina):</span> It is until and including the place of Chivuk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - R. Chiya brei d'Rav Avya - Answer (d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> It is until and including the place of Chivuk. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Questions (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If the blood has one of the following shapes, what is the law? It is a ring, there are many drops, or it is across the width of her thigh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If she found a Kesem on her body, Safek Tahor, Safek Tamei, she is Teme'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> (Surely, the Chidush of the Beraisa (or of the extra words Safek Tahor, Safek Tamei) is) even if it is one of these shapes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it is in a strip. (Rashi - it is the way blood would drip from the place. Rashba - we would not expect blood to drip this way. It is a Chidush that she is Teme'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>A case occurred in which a woman found blood on her frame. (She was walking carrying a frame with threads arranged for weaving.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yanai:</span> Go walk the same way you walked before! If the frame passes under the place, you are Teme'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do not repeat (simulate) an incident (and assume that it will resemble what happened) regarding Taharos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not simulate to be lenient, but we do simulate to be stringent.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN SHE MAY BE <i>TOLEH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she took off her garment (and covered herself with it, she is Teme'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> In Romi I ruled that she is Teme'ah. When I came to Chachamim of the south (in Eretz Yisrael), they approved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a tall woman and a short woman exchanged garments, and a Kesem was found:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the place of blood comes in line with the place of both women, both are (Safek) Teme'os;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it comes in line only with the place of the short woman, she is Teme'ah, and the other is Tehorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Leah checked a garment and lent it to Rachel, and Rachel found a Kesem, she is Toleh on Leah. (She assumes that Leah did not check well.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> This refers to the toil of laundering the stain (Rachel is exempt). However, Leah is Tehorah, and Rachel is Teme'ah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">58b----------------------------------------58b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between this and the following?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If two women were dealing with a bird that had blood the size of a Sela, and each found a Kesem of this size, both are Teme'os. (Tosfos - this is even if one woman found her Kesem before the other. We do not (retroactively) attribute her Kesem to the bird.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is different, for there is an extra Sela of blood. (There is no reason to attribute it to one woman more than the other.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a woman wore three layers of checked garments and found a Kesem, if she has a Teliyah (something to attribute the blood to) she is Toleh, even if it is on the inner garment. If she has no Teliyah, she is not Toleh, even if it is on the outer garment;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she passed through a meat market she is Toleh even for the inner garment. If she did not pass through a meat market (or deal with blood in any other way), she is not Toleh, even for the outer garment.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ON WHAT ARE WE <i>TOLEH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She may be Toleh on anything possible, e.g.:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she slaughtered a Chayah, Behemah or bird;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she was engaged in Kesamim or sat near people engaging in them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If she killed a louse, she may be Toleh on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much may she be Toleh?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina ben Antignos):</span> She may be Toleh up to a Gris (bean), and even if she did not kill a louse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>She may be Toleh on her son or husband (if he has a wound, or he was dealing with blood);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If she has a wound (even if it has a scab on it) that can open up and emit blood, she is Toleh on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A case occurred in which a woman found a Kesem and came in front of R. Akiva. He asked if she had a wound.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The woman:</span> I had a wound, but it healed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Perhaps it could open up and emit blood!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>She said yes. R. Akiva was Metaher her. His Talmidim looked bewildered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Chachamim enacted to be Metamei women due to Kesamim, but to be lenient (whenever we can be Toleh);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah says "v'Ishah Ki Siheyeh Zavah Dam Yihyeh Zovah bi'Vesarah" -- (she is Tamei due to) blood, but not due to a Kesem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Eliezer bar Tzadok says, if an Ed was under a pillow and blood was found on it in a round shape, she is Tehorah. If it is a streak, she is Teme'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Our Mishnah teaches like the following Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Cases occurred in which R. Meir was Toleh on a bandage, and Rebbi was Toleh on sycamore sap.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>(Mishnah):... Or if she sat (near people involved with Kesamim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> She may be Toleh only if she surely sat there. If she in unsure, she may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Our Mishnah teaches like the following Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If she passed through a meat market and is unsure whether or not blood splashed on her, she may be Toleh (a Kesem) on it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she is unsure whether or not she passed through a meat market, she is Teme'ah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><i>TELIYAH</i> ON LICE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she killed a louse...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> She may be Toleh only if she killed a louse. Our Mishnah is like R. Shimon ben Gamliel:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> She may be Toleh only if she killed a louse;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, she may be Toleh whether or not she killed a louse.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon ben Gamliel:</span> According to me, there is no end (to the stringencies of Kesamim). It is very hard for a woman to remain permitted to her husband. Beds always have many drops of blood from lice!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>According to Chachamim, there is no limit (to how much blood we are Toleh on a louse, even if she did not kill one). A woman is always Tehorah (even if the blood was from her. They are Toleh, for even men's) sheets always have many drops of blood from lice!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Rather, R. Chanina ben Antignos' opinion is proper, that she may be Toleh up to the size of a Gris.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do Chachamim allow her to be Toleh a massive Kesem on a louse?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> She is Toleh up to a Tormus (lupine, a legume) on a Pishpesh (bedbug).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Pishpesh is as wide as it is long. It tastes like it smells. Hash-m made a covenant with it, that whoever squashes it in his hand will smell it. (Everything was created with its consent. We read "va'Yechulu ha'Shamayim veha'Aretz v'Chol <i>Tzeva'am</i>" like "Tzivyonam" (the form they chose - Chulin 60a). Presumably, the Pishpesh requested this covenant so that people will be loathe to kill it - <b>PF</b>.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>'It is as wide as it is long' teaches about Kesamim. (Rashi - we may be Toleh such a Kesem on a Pishpesh; Rashba - this helps identify a Pishpesh. Where such bugs are found, we may be Toleh a Kesem of any shape on them);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>'It tastes like it smells' teaches about Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one had Terumah in his mouth and tasted a Pishpesh, he may spit out the Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How would someone know the taste of Pishpesh?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It tastes like it smells.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is a covenant that whoever squashes it smells it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> We are not concerned for Kesamim in a city with pigs. (They eat vermin and strew blood.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Dedokeres (a certain city that had many butchers and vermin-infested waste heaps) is like a city with pigs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> How much may she be Toleh? (R. Chanina ben Antignos says, up to a Gris... )</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> She may be Toleh up to a Gris, but not a full Gris.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> She may be Toleh a full Gris, but not more.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Suggestion:</span> They argue about Ad v'Ad Bichlal (whether or not "Ad" (until) connotes "up to <i>and including</i>"):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Chisda holds that Ad v'Ad Bichlal, and Rav Huna holds that Ad v'Lo Ad Bichlal (up to but not including).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Huna sometimes holds Ad v'Ad Bichlal, and sometimes Ad v'Lo Ad Bichlal, whichever is more stringent (in the particular case);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Chisda agrees that normally, we follow whichever is more stringent. Kesamim are different due to R. Avahu's teaching;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Whenever Chachamim gave a Shi'ur, we are always stringent about the exact amount (regarding Ad v'Ad Bichlal), except for a Kesem the size of a Gris. We are lenisent about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> They argue about whether or not Ad v'Ad Bichlal regarding Kesamim. (Rashba - the two versions do not argue. One should teach the exact words he heard. Alternatively, they argue about the (coming) case in which Ad v'Ad Bichlal is a stringency, to be Toleh a Kesem below the belt on a Kesem above.)</p>
