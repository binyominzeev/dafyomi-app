<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>RETROACTIVE <i>TUM'AH</i> OF A NIDAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rava - Beraisa):</span> (We explain according to the text of the Bach. It seems that this is also Rashi's text.) If a woman sees a Kesem (today) she is retroactively Metamei (Rashi - from the last time she washed the garment; Rambam - for 24 hours) food, drink, Mishkav u'Moshav, and Klei Cheres with a Tzamid Pasil);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She is unsure about her count. (Perhaps the seven days of Nidah and the ensuing days of Zivah begin today. If the Kesem is from before, they already began);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a man had relations with her (during the period of Safek) he is a (Safek) Bo'el Nidah (one who had relations with a Nidah, who is Tamei like a Nidah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>She must wait seven days (starting today) before immersing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a woman sees blood (today) she is retroactively Metamei, for 24 hours, food, drink, Mishkav u'Moshav, and Klei Cheres with a Tzamid Pasil;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The seven days of Nidah start today. After this, she may immerse;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She does not retroactively make a man a Bo'el Nidah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Akiva says, she retroactively makes him a Bo'el Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Whether she sees blood or a Kesem, we are Toleh. (We neither eat nor burn Kodshim that she touched before.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Rava had heard this Beraisa, why did he (make a Kal va'Chomer to teach about Mishkav u'Moshav, and) not cite the Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he had not heard the Beraisa, how did he know that she is Metamei retroactively Klei Cheres with a Tzamid Pasil?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He had heard the Beraisa, but one could have explained that (Chachamim made a Heker, and) she is retroactively Metamei a Mishkav to be Metamei people <i>or</i> Kelim, but not to be Metamei a person <i>and</i> the garments he is wearing (unless it touches them). Therefore, he made the Kal va'Chomer.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IS <i>TERUMAH</i> RETROACTIVELY <i>TAMEI</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Huna):</span> The 24 hours (of retroactive Tum'ah) apply to Kodshim, but not to Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, this should have been taught with the stringencies of Kodshim over Terumah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, we only taught cases where there is Derara of (grounds for suspecting) Tum'ah. (This does not apply to the 24 hours.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> She is retroactively Metamei food, drink...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This applies to Kodshim and Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it applies only to Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> She checks herself also when she finishes eating Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason? If she was Teme'ah, she already transgressed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> She checks for the sake of the leftovers that she touched. (If she is Tehorah now, this will guard her leftovers from retroactive Tum'ah if she will find herself to be Teme'ah later.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question 1 - Rav Huna):</span> She checks herself within "Shi'ur Veses" (a very short time. Here, "Veses" does not refer to her regular period.) If she finds herself to be Teme'ah, she burns what was in her hands just before this. (Rav Huna admits that she is retroactively Teme'ah for this amount of time.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A case occurred, and Rebbi ruled like R. Eliezer (that if a young woman did not see blood for three consecutive periods, Dayah Sha'atah). After he remembered he said "in pressed circumstances, one may rely on R. Eliezer's opinion."</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does "after he remembered" mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He remembered that the Halachah does not follow R. Eliezer, rather, Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, even in pressed circumstances, he could not rely on R. Eliezer's opinion!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Halachah was not decided like either of them. He remembered that Chachamim (i.e. the majority) argue with him, so l'Chatchilah one should rule like Chachamim, but in pressed circumstances one can rely on R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question (h):</span> Rebbi lived after the Churban. There were no Kodshim then. We must say that the 24 hours apply to Terumah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case involved food prepared to be used for Kodshim (Rashi; R. Chananel - Al Taharas ha'Kodesh), like was done in Ula's time;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> People in Galil prepare wine and oil to be used for Nesachim in case the Mikdash will be rebuilt suddenly (Rashi; R. Chananel - they eat Al Taharas ha'Kodesh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A case occurred in which R. Gamliel's slave was baking loaves of Terumah. Between each loaf she would wash her hands and check herself. After the last one, she found herself to be Teme'ah. R. Gamliel ruled that all the loaves are Teme'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The slave:</span> I checked myself in between!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> If so, the last loaf is Tamei, and the rest are Tehorim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> This shows that Terumah becomes Tamei due to the 24 hours!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Terumah" refers to Terumas Lachmei Todah (the Kohen's share of breads brought with a Todah. They are Kodshim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do not designate which loaves are Terumah at the time of baking! (They are designated only after slaughtering the Todah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, they were designated at the time of kneading, likes Rav Tuvi taught.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Tuvi bar Rav Ketinah):</span> If one baked four loaves of Lachmei Todah, he was Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Forty loaves are required!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only l'Chatchilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Terumah must be given to the Kohen from each of the four varieties!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We give him a piece of each loaf.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Echad" teaches that he must get a full loaf.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A tenth of the dough for each variety was separated (to be Terumah) at the time of kneading. The remainder (of each variety) was baked as one loaf. (Rav Tuvi taught that the owner's share can be four loaves. There must be another four of Terumah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A case occurred in which R. Gamliel's slave was sealing barrels of wine. Between each barrel she would wash her hands and check herself. After the last one, she found herself to be Teme'ah. R. Gamliel ruled that all the barrels are Teme'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The slave:</span> I checked myself in between!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> If so, the last barrel is Tamei, and the rest are Tehorim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Granted, if one of these episodes involved Terumah, she needed to ask again. However, if both involved Kodshim, why did she need to ask again?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case of the wine involved a different slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Huna):</span> The 24 hours apply to Kodshim and Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If not, this should have been taught with the stringencies of Kodshim over Terumah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman - Beraisa):</span> It applies to Kodshim, not to Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> It applies to <i>Chulin Al Taharas</i> Kodesh, but not to Chulin Al Taharas Terumah. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a dough became Safek Tamei before it was kneaded, one may make it definitely Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Before kneading, it is Chulin. One may be Metamei Chulin in Eretz Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it became Safek Tamei after it was kneaded, one may not make it definitely Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>After kneading, it is Tevel with respect to Chalah (i.e. Chalah must be separated), so it must be guarded (from Tum'ah) like Chalah itself.</p>
