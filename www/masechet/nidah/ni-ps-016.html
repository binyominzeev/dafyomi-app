<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ARE <i>VESTOS</i> MID'ORAISA OR MID'RABANAN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are Vestos mid'Oraisa or mid'Rabanan?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Rav Huna said in the name of Rav that if a woman did not check herself at the time of her Veses, and saw Dam later, she must be concerned for (Taharos that she touched after) the time of her Veses, and for (the 24 hours before) the time she saw (Rashi; Tosfos - she is in Safek when she became a Nidah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> (Since she is concerned for the time of her Veses,) this shows that Vestos are mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> She is concerned for the time of her Veses only because she saw later. This shows that Vestos are mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If a woman did not check herself at the time of her Veses, and checked herself later:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she found herself to be Teme'ah, she is Teme'ah. If she found herself to be Tehorah, she is Tehorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> In either case she is Teme'ah. We assume that the blood came in its usual time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav holds that Vestos are mid'Rabanan, and Shmuel holds that Vestos are mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (R. Zeira):</span> No, all agree that Vestos are mid'Oraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav discusses one who checked herself within Shi'ur Veses. Shmuel discusses one who checked herself after Shi'ur Veses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Indeed, they argue about whether Vestos are mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> Rav and Shmuel argue as the following Tana'im do:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> (If a woman did not check herself at the time of her Veses), she is (Muchzekes to be) a Nidah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua says, she checks herself later. (if she finds herself to be Tehorah, she is Tehorah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>In another Beraisa, R. Meir holds like R. Eliezer, and Chachamim hold like R. Yehoshua.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We know R. Meir's opinion from a Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If a woman was hiding (from an invading army or bandits) and her Veses came and she did not check herself, she is Tehorah, for fear is Mesalek ha'Damim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If not for the fear, she would be a Nidah. This shows that R. Meir holds that Vestos are mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Also the following Tana'im argue about whether Vestos are mid'Oraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> If a woman sees blood due to a wound (in the area), even at the time of her Veses, she is Tehorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi says, if she has a Veses, she is concerned for it. (She is Safek Nidah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel holds that Vestos are mid'Rabanan, and Rebbi holds that Vestos are mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Ravina):</span> All agree that Vestos are mid'Rabanan. They argue about whether blood from the Makor (which is not Dam Nidah) is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says that she is not a Nidah, but the blood is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi says, if you are concerned for the Veses, then also she is Teme'ah. If you are not concerned for the Veses, then the blood is Tahor. Blood from the Makor (which is not Dam Nidah) is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CHECKING BEFORE AND AFTER BI'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> A woman needs two Edim (examination cloths) for (Rashi - checking herself before and after; Tosfos - checking herself and her husband after) every act of Bi'ah, or she may re-use the same two Edim if they have Bi'ah in front of a lamp (she checks them each time);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Hillel say, two Edim suffice for the entire night. (Rashi - one before the first Bi'ah, one after the last; Tosfos - she may re-use them without checking each time).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> Even though Chachamim disparage Bi'ah in front of a light, she needs two Edim for each act of Bi'ah, or they must have Bi'ah in front of a light (so she can check the Edim);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Beis Hillel say, two Edim suffice for the entire night.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Beis Shamai:</span> You should be concerned lest there be a drop of blood (Rashi - inside her; Tosfos - on the Ed), and semen from a later act of Bi'ah will cover it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Beis Hillel:</span> Also you should be concerned lest a drop of blood was covered by semen from that very act of Bi'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Beis Shamai:</span> If it was a covered by semen from one act of Bi'ah, it is recognizable, but not if it was covered by semen from many acts of Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehoshua):</span> I agree with Beis Shamai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">His Talmidim:</span> You are very stringent on us!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> It is better that it be difficult for you in this world, in order that you will have length of days in the World to Come!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> From both Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai we learn that (Bi'ah can cause blood to come. Therefore,) a Ba'al Nefesh (spiritual person) should not have Bi'ah twice without Bedikos (inspecting by a light) in between!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Even a Ba'al Nefesh need not check in between;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai argue about Bedikos for the sake of Taharos, but not to permit Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rava - Beraisa):</span> These Bedikos are for the sake of Taharos. Bi'ah is permitted without them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This is when he left her when she was Tehorah (he may assume that she is still Tehorah without asking), but if she was Teme'ah, she is Muchzekes Teme'ah until she tells him that she is Tehorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> If a woman checked herself and lost the Ed, she may not have Bi'ah until she checks herself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Ila):</span> Had she not lost it, she would be permitted to have Bi'ah without looking at it (until morning). The same should apply now that it is lost!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If it is around, later she will know her status (regarding Taharos and Korban);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is lost, she will not know her status. (In effect, she did not fulfill Chachamim's enactment of Bedikah.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BI'AH DURING THE DAY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One may not have Bi'ah during the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He learns from "Yovad Yom Ivaled Bo veha'Lailah Amar Horah Gaver" -- night is the time for (the act that leads to) pregnancy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> We learn from "Bozeh Derachav Yamus" (if one has Bi'ah during the day, he may see something which will make him Mevazeh (scorn) her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Reish Lakish expounds R. Yochanan's verse like R. Chanina bar Papa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina bar Papa):</span> The angel appointed over pregnancy is called Lailah. It brings the drop (of semen from which a fetus will develop) in front of Hash-m, and Hash-m decrees whether the person will grow to be strong or weak, wise or foolish, and rich or poor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Hash-m does not decree whether he will be a Tzadik or Rasha;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> Everything that happens to one is determined by Hash-m, except for whether or not he will fear Hash-m -- "Mah Hash-m Elokecha Sho'el me'Imach Ki Im l'Yirah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yochanan disagrees, for according to Reish Lakish, it should say "Gever Horah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, "Horah Gaver" teaches that night is the time for (Bi'ah, which leads to) pregnancy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yochanan expounds Reish Lakish's verse like Sefer Ben Sira;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Sefer Ben Sira):</span> I hate three -- a Chacham who frequents (some say - is very talkative or argumentative in) the drinking house, one who teaches Talmidim at the city summit (this is haughty, and it inconveniences travelers) and one who holds his Ever while urinating.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>There is a fourth I do not love -- one who enters another's house suddenly. (Perhaps those inside are engaged in something immodest.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One should not enter even his own house suddenly.</p>
<p class="bas normal"></p>
