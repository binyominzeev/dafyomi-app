<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TUM'AH D'RABANAN OF BLOOD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> Blood of a Nochris, and Dam Tohar of a Metzora'as are Tehorim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Hillel says, they are Teme'im like her spit and urine (i.e. when they are wet).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Beis Shamai says, if a Yoledes did not immerse, her Dam Tohar is Tamei like her spit and urine;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Beis Hillel says, it is Tamei wet or dry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Shamai agrees that if she was Yoledes b'Zov, it is Tamei wet or dry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Doesn't Beis Shamai agree with the following Beraisa?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Dabru El Bnei Yisrael... Ki Yihyeh Zav" -- mid'Oraisa, Zivah (of a man or woman) applies only to Bnei Yisrael, but Chachamim decreed that Nochrim are like Zavim (or Zavos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beis Shamai agrees with it (regarding spit and urine), but we cannot be Metamei her blood!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we will say that it is Tamei wet or dry, this is like Tum'ah mid'Oraisa of a Yisraelis. (People will think that it is mid'Oraisa, and they will burn Terumah or Kodshim due to it!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If we will say that it is Tamei only if it is wet, people will think that this leniency of blood applies also to Tum'ah mid'Oraisa of a Yisraelis!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Beis Shamai admit that we decreed about a Nochris' spit and urine? The same concerns apply!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since we are Metaher her blood, people realize that Tum'ah of her spit and urine is only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't Beis Shamai decree about her blood, and be Metaher her spit and urine, to reveal that Tum'ah of her blood is only mid'Rabanan?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Spit and urine are more common than blood, therefore they decreed about them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TUM'AH MID'RABANAN OF ZOV AND KERI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Even Beis Shamai is Metamei a Nochri's Zov. Even Beis Hillel is Metaher his semen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even Beis Shamai is Metamei his Zov. Since we are Metaher his semen, people realize that his Zov is Tamei only mid'Rabanan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even Beis Hillel is Metaher his semen, in order that people will realize that his Zov is Tamei only mid'Rabanan, so they will not burn Terumah or Kodshim (Gra's text - bring a Korban for Tum'as Mikdash or Kodshim) due to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why aren't we Metamei his semen and Metaher his Zov, to reveal that Tum'ah of his semen is only mid'Rabanan?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We decreed about his Zov, for it comes without cause, but semen comes only through a cause (the Ever becoming warmed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If semen of a Yisrael exuded from a Nochris, it is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If semen of a Nochri exuded from a Yisraelis, it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is fully Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it is Tahor mid'Oraisa, but it is Tamei mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Semen of a Yisrael is Tamei anywhere, even inside a Nochris;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">34b----------------------------------------34b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Semen of a Nochri is Tahor anywhere, even inside a Yisraelis, unless (drops of his) urine is mixed with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is no support. Perhaps a Nochri's semen in a Yisraelis is Tahor mid'Oraisa, but Tamei mid'Rabanan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa teaches that if his urine is mixed in, it is Tamei, i.e. mid'Rabanan. This implies that if his urine is not mixed in, it is Tahor even mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Semen of a Yisrael is Tamei anywhere, even inside a Nochris.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This resolves Rav Papa's question!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If semen of a Yisrael is inside a Nochris, is it Tamei?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Rav Papa knew that within three days, it is Tamei (as if was in a Yisraelis). He asks about after three days:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps semen putrefies (and loses its Tum'ah) in a Yisraelis after three days, for the bodies of Yisraelim are warm, for they are fearful about Mitzvos. A Nochris is cool, so the semen does not putrefy so quickly;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps bodies of Nochrim are equally warm, for they eat Shekatzim u'Remashim (insects and swarming creatures)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DAM TOHAR OF A METZORA'AS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> Dam Tohar of a Metzora'as is Tahor...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Beis Hillel's reason (to be Metamei)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> "La'Zachar" includes Mayanos of a Metzora. "Vela'Nekevah" includes Mayanos of a Metzora'as;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Mayanos of a woman are included?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It includes other Mayanos (that also men have).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Surely, if they are Teme'im in a man, they are also Teme'im in a woman!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes Dam Tohar. (We already know that her other bloods are Teme'im.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Beis Shamai argues that we cannot learn from a man to a woman, for a Metzora is more stringent than a Metzora'as. He must do Peri'ah (let his hair grow) and Perimah (tear his clothing), and he is forbidden to have Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Beis Hillel agrees with this. However, the Torah could have taught Mayanos of a Metzora'as, and we would have learned those of a Metzora (from a Kal va'Chomer);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Since we do not need "la'Zachar" to include Mayanos of a Metzora, we use it to include Dam Tohar of a Metzora'as (even though blood is not a proper Mayan, it drips out without accumulating).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1:</span> Beis Shamai does not learn from women to men, for there is a stringency of women. Women become Zavos even though Ones, but men do not become Zavim though Ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel holds that a stringency of Zivah does not refute a Kal va'Chomer regarding Tzara'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Shamai holds that any stringency regarding Tum'ah can refute the Kal va'Chomer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2:</span> Beis Shamai needs "la'Zachar" to teach that any male, even a minor, can become a Zav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel learn this from "Zos Toras ha'Zav."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>ZOV</i> OF A BOY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef citing Reish Lakish):</span> If a boy (less than nine) saw one sighting of Zov, does the Zov have Tum'as Maga (of touching)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps "Zos Toras ha'Zav va'Asher Tetzei Mimenu Shichvas Zera" teaches that a man's first sighting of Zov is Tamei only if his semen is Tamei (he is above nine);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since if he will see a second sighting (on the same day or the morrow) the two sightings join to make him a Zav, even the first sighting has Tum'as Maga!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "V'Zos Toras ha'Zav" applies whether he is small (below nine) or an adult. (For this law, above nine is an adult);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like an adult's first sighting of Zov is Tamei, also a child's.</p>
