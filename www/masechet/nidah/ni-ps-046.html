<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (against R. Yochanan - R. Zeira - Beraisa):</span> "<i>Ish</i> Ki Yafli Lindor Neder" includes a boy above 13. Even though he does not know to Whom he vowed, it takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he did not grow hairs, he is still a minor!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he grew hairs;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The hairs are significant after 13. During year 13 they would be a Shuma!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yochanan is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (Rav Nachman):</span> Tana'im argue as Rav and R. Yochanan do:</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, (after nine) they are a Siman.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> The first Tana says that between 9 and 12, they are a Shuma. This implies that he agrees that after 12 they are a Siman;</p>

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> During year 13, they argue!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Different Tana'im taught these clauses. The former Tana holds that the year 13 is like the next year, and the latter Tana holds that it is like the previous year!</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Explanation #1:</span> The Beraisa discusses a girl. The first Tana holds like Rebbi. (Her age, at which hairs are a Siman, is 12.) The latter Tana holds like R. Shimon. (Her age is 13);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Explanation #2:</span> The Beraisa discusses a boy. The first Tana holds like R. Shimon (his age is 12), and the latter Tana holds like Rebbi (his age is 13);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Explanation #3:</span> The entire Beraisa is like Rebbi. It first discusses a girl (her age is 12), and then a boy (his age is 13);</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, they are a Siman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rava):</span> The Halachah is, <i>the</i> year is like the previous one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rav Shmuel bar Zutra (Rava):</span> (An orphaned girl cannot marry mid'Oraisa until she matures. Chachamim enacted marriage mid'Rabanan for her, and allow her to do Mi'un (retroactively annul the marriage) until she <i>matures</i>.) A girl may do Mi'un anytime until 12 full years;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After 12, she may not do Mi'un or Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He forbids Mi'un because he assumes that she is an adult (and the marriage became mid'Oraisa);</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rava is in Safek whether or not she is an adult.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rava taught that we need not check a girl above 12. She is Muchzekes to be an adult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Normally, we assume that she is an adult. She may not do Chalitzah in a case when we see that she does not have hairs now.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, she should be allowed to do Mi'un!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are concerned lest she brought hairs after 12 years, and they fell out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that is concerned that they fell out. According to the opinion that is not concerned, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> We are concerned that they fell out;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papi):</span> We are not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is only regarding Chalitzah. (Rav Papi does not assume that they fell out to allow Chalitzah.) Regarding Mi'un, all are concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This implies that Rav Papa permits Chalitzah. However, he says we are concerned (perhaps they fell out)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (j)):</span> Really, we did not check her. Regarding Chalitzah we are concerned. (Perhaps she is still a minor.) Rava's Chazakah refers to Mi'un. (We are stringent not to allow Mi'un);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She may not do Chalitzah until we see hairs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi of Neharde'a):</span> The Halachah is, (regarding Mi'un) we are concerned lest they fell out.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if she had Bi'ah with her husband after 12 years of age, for then it is a Safek mid'Oraisa. (If she brought hairs after 12 and before Bi'ah, she is married mid'Oraisa.) If not, she may do Mi'un. (She is married only mid'Rabanan.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HEKDESH OF A MINOR CLOSE TO ADULTHOOD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If a Mufla Samuch l'Ish (a minor in the year before adulthood) was Makdish something and ate it, he is lashed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "Ish Ki Yafli Lindor Neder," and it says "(Ish Ki Yidor... ) Lo Yachel Devaro." Whoever is an "Ish" for the former (his vows take effect) is an Ish for the latter (he is liable for transgressing them), and vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Question (against Rava, and support for Rav Huna - Rav Huna bar Yehudah - Beraisa) Suggestion: The Torah considers a minor to be like an adult regarding intentional transgression of oaths, Isar (another way of taking a vow or oath; see Shevu'os 20a) and Lo Yachel. Perhaps one who benefits from Hekdesh of a minor brings a Korban Me'ilah!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">46b----------------------------------------46b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Zeh ha'Davar" (teaches that he is like an adult only for Lo Yachel, but not for Me'ilah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> The Beraisa says that a minor is like an adult regarding Isar and Lo Yachel! (I.e. he is lashed. Our text is like the Rashba and Ran. The Aruch la'Ner questions the basis of the question. Perhaps Rava holds like Rav Huna! He suggests that when the Gemara said (45b, 4:a:2) that <i>the</i> year is like before or after regarding punishments, this means punishments for Nedarim. Accordingly, Rava disagrees with Rav Huna. Maharsha - the question is not against Rava, rather, against the Amora'im below who obligate adults for the minor's Hekdesh, but exempt the minor.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, he is like an adult regarding the Isur of Lo Yachel, but he is not lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In any case this is difficult!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Mufla Samuch l'Ish is mid'Oraisa (it is forbidden even to him), he should be lashed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is mid'Rabanan, he should not be forbidden! (Chachamim do not forbid minors.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim commanded the one who supervises the minor to stop him from transgressing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Beis Din (i.e. all adults) are commanded to stop minors from transgressing! (This is unlike R. Pedas (Yevamos 113b).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 to Question (b)):</span> No. The case is, the minor was Makdish and adults ate it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that adults are lashed for (benefit from) a minor's Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that adults are not lashed for a minor's Hekdesh, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> If an adult ate a minor's Hekdesh, he is not lashed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish):</span> He is lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is lashed mid'Rabanan. What we expounded from "Ish Ki Yafli" is only an Asmachta.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ANNULING VOWS OF A MUFLA SAMUCH L'ISH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> If an adult ate a minor's Hekdesh, he is not lashed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish):</span> He is lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Kahana holds that Mufla Samuch l'Ish is mid'Rabanan, and R. Yochanan holds that it is mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah - Beraisa):</span> If an orphaned girl (who was married mid'Rabanan) took a vow, her husband can be Mefer (annul) it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand this if Mufla Samuch l'Ish is mid'Rabanan. The marriage is mid'Rabanan, therefore he can be Mefer a mid'Rabanan vow;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, if Mufla Samuch l'Ish is mid'Oraisa, how can he be Mefer a Torah vow? Mid'Oraisa she is not his wife!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> In any case, he can be Mefer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the vow is mid'Rabanan, he can be Mefer (like we explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is mid'Oraisa, Chachamim authorize him to be Mefer;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Even though mid'Oraisa, the vow is in force, we are not concerned. She is a minor, and Beis Din need not stop a minor from transgressing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since we say that it is annulled, she will transgress even after she becomes an adult!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Livai):</span> Her husband is Mefer constantly (in case she just matured). the Hafarah is valid if they had Bi'ah (after she matured, for then the marriage is mid'Oraisa. Seemingly, just like she may not eat Terumah mid'Oraisa (due to her husband, if he is a Kohen) lest she eat in the interim (after maturing before the next Bi'ah - Tosfos Yevamos 90a), she should be bound by her vow lest she transgress it in the interim! The Rashba asks that one may not tell a child to transgress even mid'Rabanan laws, and Hafarah is like telling her to transgress! He answers that we could have asked this (in addition to the coming objection). Perhaps we could have asked also about the interim! - <b>PF</b>)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> A husband cannot be Mefer vows that she made before he married her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Even though mid'Oraisa they are not married, he can be Mefer due to Rav Pinchas' teaching:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Pinchas):</span> A woman vows on condition that her husband will consent. (This applies even if the marriage is only mid'Rabanan, for she considers him to be her husband.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If a minor did not bring hairs, if he separates Terumah, it does not take effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi says, if he is younger than Onas ha'Nedarim (Mufla Samuch l'Ish), his Terumah does not take effect. If he reached Onas ha'Nedarim, it is Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We are thinking that R. Yosi holds that (the obligation to take) Terumah is mid'Oraisa nowadays (after the Churban).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If Mufla Samuch l'Ish is mid'Oraisa, we understand this. His Terumah is mid'Oraisa, so it exempts Tevel mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If Mufla Samuch l'Ish is mid'Rabanan, how can Terumah mid'Rabanan exempt Tevel mid'Oraisa?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi holds that Terumah is mid'Rabanan nowadays.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa in Seder Olam):</span> "Asher Yarshu Avosecha vi'Rishta" alludes to two inheritances (of Eretz Yisrael, in Yehoshua's time and in Ezra's time). There will not be a third (because Ezra's Kedushah did not cease after the second Churban. Therefore, Terumah should still be mid'Oraisa today!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> An anonymous Beraisa in Seder Olam is assumed to be R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi taught this (that there will not be a third Kedushah), but he disagrees. (Rashash, based on Tosfos Eruvin 9b - R. Yosi merely compiled Seder Olam from teachings of previous Chachamim.)</p>
