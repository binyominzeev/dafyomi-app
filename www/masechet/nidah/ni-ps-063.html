<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ROK TEFEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Spit is Tefel if...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one did not taste anything since (last) night (his spit is Tefel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This means, he did not eat all night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> It does not say "<i>at</i> night," rather, "<i>since</i> (last) night." We exclude one who rose to eat (before dawn, but not one who ate last night. Sleep adds potency to spit. Eating weakens it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Spit is Tefel if the person was asleep at midnight.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The law depends on sleep.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> (Even) if one slept the entire day, his spit is not Tefel. If he was awake the entire night, his spit is Tefel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (It depends on sleeping at night.) The Beraisa discusses one who dozed at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered dozing?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> He is half asleep, and half awake. If one calls to him, he responds, but he cannot give an answer that requires reasoning. When one reminds him (what he heard), he remembers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one woke up and taught, his spit is not Tefel. (Talking weakens spit.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much must he teach (in order that his spit will not be Tefel)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah bar Shila):</span> If he spoke for the majority of three hours, his spit is not Tefel.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CONDITIONS OF THE TEST</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Mei Grisim (is chewed shelled beans).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This supports Reish Lakish:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Tefel spit must accompany each of the ingredients.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, perhaps he must chew them in order to warm them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Our Mishnah is unlike R. Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Mei Grisim must be boiling, "Over" (before it is weakened through) adding salt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that "Over" means "before"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> We learn from "... va'Ya'avor Es ha'Kushi."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> We learn from "v'Hu Avar Lifneihem."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> We learn from "va'Ya'avor Malkam Lifneihem va'Shem b'Rosham."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Urine that putrefied.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Urine is considered putrefied after three days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Other factors affect the seven ingredients:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The potency of urine depends on whether it came from a child or elder, if it was exposed or covered, if it was in winter or summer (the latter of these is more potent), or of a man or woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Each ingredient must be rubbed three times (on the Kesem).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Does rubbing back and forth count like once, or like twice?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one applied the ingredients out of order or at the same time, this has no effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If one applied latter ingredients before earlier ingredients, the latter count, but the earlier ones do not count. (Only the earlier ones must be applied again.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> The earlier ones count, but the latter do not count.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Resolution (Abaye):</span> Both Beraisos agree that only the latter ingredients applied count;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beraisa #2 means that the ingredients that come earlier in the order of the seven, which were applied last, count.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>KINDS OF <i>VESTOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman has a Veses, Dayah Sha'atah. (She is Teme'ah from when she sees blood and onwards, but not retroactively);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The following are Vestos -- she sees blood after stretching or sneezing (there are various opinions about these words, including belching or passing gas. Rosh - all of the explanations are Divrei Elokim Chayim. All are Vestos), a pain in her stomach or womb, she spurts (blood) (this will be explained), or is gripped by chills, or anything similar;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Anything that happened three times (before she saw) is a Veses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> We already learn this from another Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any woman with a Veses is Dayah Sha'atah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to a Veses of days (she normally sees the same day every month, or a certain number of days after her previous period). our Mishnah discusses Vestos ha'Guf (based on her body) -- after stretching...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> She spurts (blood. Rashi - since she spurts every day, this is not a Veses!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula brei d'Rav Ilai):</span> She spurts a Tahor color of blood, and amidst this sees a Tamei color of blood.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">63b----------------------------------------63b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She is gripped by chills (<i>or anything similar</i>).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Ula):</span> This includes one whose sees blood after her head or limbs feel heavy, or after she trembles (Rambam - gets hot) or yawns.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> I heard that a Veses of days is established after two sightings. Veses ha'Guf requires one sighting. Vestos that Chachamim did not list require three sightings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Shmuel):</span> What are these Vestos which Chachamim did not list?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1(Rav Yosef):</span> Her head or limbs feel heavy, or she trembles or yawns.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> What is the Chidush? Rabah bar Ula explained that the Mishnah alludes to these!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> It teaches about one who saw after eating garlic, onions, or pepper.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I never heard this teaching (of Shmuel. When Rav Yosef became sick, he forgot his learning.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> You taught it to us when you explained the following!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a woman used to see on the 15th (of the month) and one month she saw on the 20th, both of these are forbidden (to have Bi'ah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she saw three consecutive months on the 20th, she is now permitted on the 15th, for she has fixed her Veses on the 20th;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A woman does not fix a Veses until three times.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef citing Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> This is like R. Gamliel bar Rebbi in the name of R. Shimon ben Gamliel (who says that Chazakah is established after three times). Chachamim say that (two times establishes a Chazakah,) if she saw, she need not see two or three times.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If she need not see two times, there is no need to say she need not see three times!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Once suffices to fix Veses ha'Guf. Twice suffices to fix a Veses of days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Shmuel simply say that the Beraisa is like R. Shimon ben Gamliel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that R. Gamliel bar Rebbi holds like R. Shimon ben Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SEEING DURING PART OF A <i>VESES</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman normally sees at the beginning of her Veses (ha'Guf, and she did not check herself until the end, and found herself Teme'ah), Taharos that she touched during the Veses are Teme'im;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If she normally sees at the end of her Veses, Taharos that she touched during the Veses are Tehoros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi says, a Veses can depend on days and hours (this will be explained). If she normally sees at sunrise, she is forbidden only at sunrise;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah says, she is permitted the entire day (but she is forbidden the night before).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Question:</span> What is R. Yosi's Veses of days and hours?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If she normally sees on the 20th (of the month) during the sixth hour, when the 20th comes:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah forbids Bi'ah during the first six hours;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> The entire night is permitted (but the entire day is forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> In the Mishnah, she normally sees (just before sunrise) at the end of the night. In the Beraisa, she normally sees (just after sunrise) at the beginning of the day.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yoshiyah):</span> "V'Hizartem... mi'Tum'asam" forbids a woman shortly before her Veses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much in advance is she forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> She is forbidden for an Onah (a night or day(time)). (If we say that Rabah taught this (like the text in Shevu'os), we must also say that Rabah ruled like R. Yehudah above (n).)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means that in addition to the Onah in which she expects to see, she is forbidden another Onah (beforehand).</p>
