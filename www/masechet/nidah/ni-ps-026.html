<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHICH COMES OUT FIRST?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #1):</span> The next child born after a Sandal is a Bechor regarding inheritance, but not regarding Pidyon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Chidush? (A child always accompanies a Sandal. Even if a Sandal were not a child, a child born in the next delivery is not a Bechor for Pidyon. However, inheritance depends on the first child over which the father would mourn.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is that if the Sandal came out first, the child born with it is not a Bechor (for Pidyon).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah #2):</span> If a woman gave birth to a Sandal, she brings a Korban (Yoledes), and it is eaten.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Chidush? (She is a Yoledes due to the accompanying child!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Chidush is when the other child was born Yotzei Dofen (through Caesarian section, for which no Korban is brought) and the Sandal came out normally.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Shimon, who obligates a Korban for a Yotzei Dofen, what is the Chidush?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If a Nochris gave birth to a child, converted, and then a Sandal came out, she brings a Korban only for the Sandal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A Sandal always comes out in unison with the other child. (There is no time to (immerse and) convert in between!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> We must say that they do not come out in perfect unison. Rather, the child's head is by the Sandal's middle;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In Mishnah #1, they came out head first, so the Sandal was born first. In Mishnah #2, they came out feet first, so the child was born first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Huna bar Tachlifa):</span> We can even say that they are head to head;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In Mishnah #1, they came out feet first. The live child clings to the wall, so the Sandal comes out first;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In Mishnah #2, they came out head first. Once (R. Chananel's text - the majority of) the live (Tosfos - or properly formed) child's head comes out, he is considered born. The Sandal is not considered born until its majority (R. Chananel - its entire head) leaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Shilya (fetal sac) is in a house, the house is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not because a Shilya is a child, rather, because there is always a child with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>R. Shimon says, perhaps the child dissolved (and was Batel in Dam Leidah) before it left!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THINGS THAT REQUIRE A <i>TEFACH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Initially, a Shilya resembles a warp thread; in the end, it resembles (alternatively - is as thick as a lupine) and is hollow like a trumpet;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Shilya is never less than a Tefach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, it is like the stomach of chickens from which the intestines come out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya Ze'ira of Chavriya's Beraisa):</span> There are five things that must be at least one Tefach -- a Shilya, a Shofar, the spine (Shidrah) of a Lulav, a wall of a Sukah, and Ezov (hyssop, for Parah Adumah or Metzora).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The above Beraisa teaches about a Shilya.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">A Shofar - (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> A Shofar must be long enough that it is visible from both ends when one wraps his fingers around it. (This is a Tefach.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">A Lulav spine - (R. Parnach):</span> The spine of a Lulav must be a Tefach longer than the Hadas (which must be at least three Tefachim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">A Sukah wall - (Beraisa):</span> Two walls must be proper walls. The third can be (any amount over) a Tefach (if it is positioned properly);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Ezov - (R. Chiya's Beraisa):</span> The Ezov must be a Tefach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina bar Papa):</span> Three of these are taught in Beraisos, and two in Shema'atsa (teachings of Amora'im).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Only one of them is a Shema'atsa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> R. Chiya's teaching is not a Beraisa, so it is considered only a Shema'atsa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Questions:</span> Also other things require a Tefach!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Mishnah):</span> A covering at least a Tefach (long) by a Tefach (wide) with (the height of) a Tefach of space underneath is an Ohel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(If Tum'as Mes is under it,) everything under the Ohel is Tamei, but the Ohel shields what is above it from the Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Oshaya's Beraisa counts Shi'urim of a Tefach long, but not Shi'urim of a square Tefach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> A stone jutting out of an oven is considered a handle up to a Tefach. (If the oven is Tamei, what touches the handle becomes Tamei.) A handle from a Kirah (an oven on which pots are placed) is up to three fingers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He only counts things that must be at least a Tefach. The handle is at most a Tefach.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">26b----------------------------------------26b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> If a girl's (toy) oven is at least a Tefach, it is Mekabel Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a new or broken oven is at least four Tefachim (tall), it is Mekabel Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, this refers to a wide oven. A new small oven of any height is Mekabel Tum'ah once it is finished. A broken oven at least half its original height is Mekabel Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does "any height" mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yanai):</span> It must be at least a Tefach, for such ovens are made for girls.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He does not count things that Tana'im argue about.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>This is also Answer #2 to Question #2!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> The handle towards the wall is at most a Tefach. (Any more than this is in the way. It will be cut off.) A handle facing the house can be any length.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question #4:</span> The rim around the Shulchan in the Mikdash is a Tefach tall!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He does not count what the Torah explicitly says must be a Tefach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question #5:</span> The Kapores (cover of the Aron) is a Tefach thick.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question (q)):</span> He does not discuss Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question #6:</span> A Korah (beam to enable making an Eruv in a Mavuy) must be a Tefach thick!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He does not count what is purely mid'Rabanan, only what pertains to Torah laws in which the Shi'ur of a Tefach is not explicit in the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ATTRIBUTING A <i>SHILYA</i> TO A FETUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yitzchak bar Shmuel citing Rav):</span> If a Shilya comes out within three days after a birth, we can attribute it to the child. After this, we are concerned lest there was another child with it. (The mother is (Safek) Yoledes Zachar or Nekevah from the latter date.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> Rav could not have said that. He says that one twin is born immediately after the other!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rav Yitzchak was silent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Kahana:</span> Perhaps Rav says that there is no delay between twins only if the first baby was viable, but there can be a delay if the first baby was a Nefel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yitzchak:</span> Do you find your own answer for Rav? Rav explicitly said so!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yitzchak citing Rav):</span> If a Shilya comes out within three days after a Nefel, we attribute it to the Nefel. After this, we are concerned lest there was another child with it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a Shilya comes out even ten days after a birth, we attribute it to the child.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Shmuel was with Rav Yehudah (who came to learn from Shmuel after Rav died) and (other) Talmidim of Rav. Rav Yosef brei d'Rav Menashya came.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> What did Rav say about a Shilya?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Rav said that we attribute a Shilya only to a viable baby.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Shmuel asked Rav's Talmidim. They agreed. Shmuel looked crossly at Rav Yehudah (because he did not tell him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yosi ben Sha'ul):</span> If a woman miscarried the form of a raven and a Shilya, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rebbi):</span> We attribute a Shilya only to species that have Shilyos (but not birds, which hatch from eggs).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yosi ben Sha'ul):</span> If the Shilya was tied to the raven, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> This would never happen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a woman miscarried the form of a animal or bird, and a fetal sac:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they are tied together, we are not concerned lest the sac contains a fetus (of a human. Surely it is from the animal);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they are not tied together, perhaps the sac of the animal dissolved, and a fetus in the remaining sac dissolved. We are stringent for both possibilities. (Tosfos - she might be Yoledes Zachar or Nekevah; Rashi - if there was a human fetus, she is a Yoledes. If the sac was from the animal, Chachamim hold that she is not a Yoledes.)</p>
