<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MAY A MAN TOUCH HIS <i>EVER</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The more a woman checks herself, the better;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a man does so (puts his hand to his Ever to check himself), his hand is worthy to be cut off!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why are men and women different?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A woman is not Bas Hargashah. (Rashi - she does not emit her seed due to sensation. R. Tam - she is not commanded to have children or not to waste seed. Tosfos ha'Rosh - she (sometimes) does not feel the blood moving.) Therefore. extra checking is laudable for her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This sensation in men causes emissions of semen. (This is one of the worst Aveiros.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should be forbidden to do so even once (unnecessarily)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, that is true;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding women, the Tana taught that doing so <i>often</i> is laudable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> One may not check himself for semen. (Presumably, he would have felt it.) It is laudable for him to check himself for Zivah. (If he already saw Zivah, he must know if more came out, to know his status regarding Tum'ah and Korbanos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even checking for semen is permitted, using a pebble or a piece of earthenware.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This Beraisa does not permit a cloth;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> He may check himself with a cloth or anything he wants!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Abaye explained (elsewhere) that (only) a thick cloth is permitted. (Since it is hard, it will not warm the Ever.) Also here, Beraisa #2 permits only a thick cloth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where did Abaye say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> If a man was eating Terumah and felt his semen moving (it is about to come out), he should hold his Ever tightly (to delay the emission) until he swallows the Terumah. (If he would spit it out, it would become repulsive.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> One who holds his Ever while urinating causes (emission of semen, like the sin of the generation punished by) a Mabul (flood)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah permits holding the Ever only through a thick cloth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> He may use even a thin cloth. Once the semen starts moving, it will come out in any case.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Abaye forbids. He is concerned lest this cause more semen to come out.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Rava holds that once the semen starts moving, holding the Ever will not cause more to come out. (Tzelach - even his bare hand would not increase the emission, but touching the Ever would be Metamei his hand. One may not eat (Terumah) with Tamei hands. Me'iri - once the Ever is heated, it is not common that more heating will cause more semen to leave. Perhaps Rava agrees that a thick cloth is better. He permits a thin cloth when there is no time to get a thick cloth - <b>PF</b>.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Eliezer):</span> One who holds his Ever while urinating causes a Mabul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> If he does not hold it, drops will fall on his feet, and people will think he is a Seris (who is impotent), and they will say that his children must be Mamzerim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> It is better that people say that his children are Mamzerim than for him to sin, even for a moment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Eliezer (to Chachamim):</span> He can stand in a high place, or in a place of loose earth, so drops will not fall on his feet, and he will not sin, even for a moment. (This implies that if neither of these are possible, he may hold the Ever.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which answer did R. Eliezer give first?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He gave Answer #1 first.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Once he said that one may never hold it, he would not permit this (where a high place or loose earth is not found)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He gave Answer #2 first;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim asked what to do if a high place or loose earth is not found. R. Eliezer said "it is better that people say..."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE SEVERITY OF WASTING SEMEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is so terrible to hold the Ever?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It causes unnecessary emissions of semen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One who emits semen unnecessarily is Chayav Misah (bi'Yedei Shamayim) -- "va'Yera b'Einei Hash-m... va'Yames Gam Oso."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak and R. Ami):</span> He is like a murderer. We read "... Shachatei ha'Yeladim" like "Sochtei". (They cause their semen to exude.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> He is like an idolater. It says here "Tachas Kol Etz Ra'anan", the same expression used regarding idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rav Yehudah and Shmuel were on the roof of a Beis ha'Keneses. Rav Yehudah needed to urinate. Shmuel told him to hold his Ever and urinate over the side.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> One who holds his Ever while urinating causes a Mabul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Rav Yehudah's case was considered like a troop;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an army entered a city in peacetime, open barrels of wine are forbidden (perhaps a soldier was Menasech, i.e. poured it to idolatry), and closed barrels are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In wartime, all are permitted, because they do not have time to be Menasech.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Because they are afraid, they are not Menasech. Also here, because Rav Yehudah was afraid, he would not have thoughts (that could lead to an emission).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was he afraid?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It was night. Perhaps he would fall off the roof.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> His Rebbi (Shmuel) was there.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> He feared the Shechinah (because he was over a Beis ha'Keneses).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> He feared Hash-m (everywhere);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Rav Yehudah (fears Hash-m like an angel, which) was not born to a woman!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rav Yehudah was married;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> A married man may hold his Ever (when urinating).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Shmuel permitted him to hold only the Beitzim from below, but not the Ever, like R. Aba taught.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> Shmuel permitted him to hold the Ever only from the crown and below (towards the end of the Ever), like R. Avahu taught.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one causes himself to have an erection, Beis Din should excommunicate him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why isn't it enough to say that it is forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is because he incites the Yetzer ha'Ra upon himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> He is called a transgressor, for this is the way of the Yetzer ha'Ra:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Today it tells one to do transgress (something small), also the next day (something slightly bigger). The next day, it tells him to serve idolatry, and he does!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> One who brings himself to sinful thoughts does not enter Hash-m's abode:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "<i>va'Yera</i> b'Einei Hash-m", and it says "... Lo Ya<i>gur</i>cha <i>Ra</i>." (Evil will not be Gar (dwell) with You.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Yedeichem Damim Male'u" refers to people who rub the Ever with their hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Lo Sin'af" (forbids rubbing the Ever) with the hand or thigh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Converts, and those who sport with minors, delay Mashi'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chelbo):</span> Converts harm Yisrael like Tzara'as. (Rashi - they do not observe the Mitzvos so well. This brings punishments, or Yisraelim learn from them. Tosfos - the Shechinah rests only on families of good lineage. Some say that Yisrael is punished severely for paining converts. R. Avraham the convert -- converts are more meticulous in Mitzvos than (native) Yisraelim. This causes Hash-m to judge Yisrael more stringently.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does "those who sport with minors" mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It refers to men who have Bi'ah with boys.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They do not merely delay Mashi'ach. They are Chayav Misah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It refers to men who excite their Ever by lying with boys (without Bi'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They do not merely delay Mashi'ach. They cause a Mabul!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It refers to men who marry girls too young to have children. (The men are idle from reproduction until their wives mature.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> Mashi'ach will not come until all the souls in (a storehouse called) Guf come to the world -- "Ru'ach mi'Lefanai Ya'atof u'Neshamos Ani Asisi".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A MAN WHO CHECKS HIMSELF</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man does so, his hand should be cut off!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this the law, like the case in which Rav Huna cut off a man's hand? (He used to hit people);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, it is a curse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Tarfon):</span> A hand that touches the Ever should be cut off (when) on the navel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> His stomach will split! (The knife will cut through his hand, and cut also his stomach.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Tarfon:</span> It is better that his stomach split, than for him to (sin and) go to Gehinom.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This makes sense if we truly cut his hand. If it is only a curse, why will his stomach split?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If we truly cut his hand, why must we do so on the stomach?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, R. Tarfon cursed a hand that touches below the navel (Maharsha - "navel" and "stomach" refer to the Ever), that it should be cut off.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> If a thorn lodged in his stomach and he cannot remove it, his stomach will split!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Tarfon:</span> It is better that his stomach split, than for him to go to Gehinom.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CHECKING PEOPLE WHO CANNOT CHECK THEMSELVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kohenes is deaf, insane, blind or went crazy, healthy women check and immerse her, so she can eat Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> A deaf woman can check herself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> There was a deaf woman in our neighborhood. Not only did she check herself, rather, other women would bring their Safek sightings or stains to her and ask whether they are appearances of Dam Nidah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That woman was able to speak. (Originally she could hear, and she went deaf.) The Mishnah discusses a woman who cannot speak nor hear.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Wherever Chachamim mention a Cheresh, he cannot speak nor hear. (Therefore, he lacks understanding.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A blind woman...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A blind woman can check herself, and ask someone else to look at it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Correction (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Indeed, "blind" should be deleted from the Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Or went crazy...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is the same as an insane woman!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She went crazy due to sickness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Kohen is insane, sane men immerse him, so he can eat Terumah at night. (Until then, perhaps he is a Tevul Yom.) They guard him that he does not sleep between immersing and eating Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Until he sleeps, he is (Muchzak to be) Tahor. Once he sleeps, he is (Safek) Tamei. (Perhaps he had an emission.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok says, we put a leather pouch around his Ever (to check whether he had an emission).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> This will warm the Ever and cause emissions!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer bar Tzadok:</span> According to you, he cannot eat Terumah (after sleeping)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> According to us, until he sleeps, he is Tahor. According to you, perhaps a drop of semen will come out and be (unnoticeably) absorbed in the pouch, and he will eat Terumah when he is Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> We make a metal pouch for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> It is of copper, which does not absorb.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> (If one needlessly carries enough Mei Chatas for sprinkling, he becomes Tamei.) When calculating the Shi'ur for sprinkling, we consider the Ezov (hyssop) stalks (which are dipped into the Mei Chatas) as if they are copper (and do not absorb. We only need enough water for drops to cling to them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> We learn from Chachamim that one may not wear pants.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "V'Aseh Lahem Michnesei Vad" (teaches that Kohanim wear pants)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> The Michnesayim are like pants of pious men (alternatively -- horsemen). They reach up to the hips and go down to the thighs;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They have straps. They are not close-fitting near the Ever (lest it get warmed) or the rectum (lest it cling inside and get sweaty. Alternatively, they do not have holes from which to urinate or excrete.)</p>
