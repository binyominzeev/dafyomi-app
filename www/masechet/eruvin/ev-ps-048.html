<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A MECHITZAH IN WATER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya - Beraisa):</span> If a fishing trap is between the Techum of two cities, one must put an iron wall [in the water between the Techumim. If not, one may not take water, even though it is from his Techum].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina laughed at this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he laugh?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Beraisa is stringent like R. Yochanan ben Nuri, and he is lenient like Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is no reason to laugh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> A Beraisa teaches that the water from flowing rivers and springs gets the Techum of the one who draws it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps R. Chiya discusses still water!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He requires an iron wall to separate;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Presumably, a wall of sticks is not good because water goes through - water also goes through an iron wall! (He did not require it to reach to the sea floor. Even if it does, some water will pass under it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps R. Chiya means that one needs a wall impervious to water, and there is no solution!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> He laughed because Chachamim are lenient about water [to allow Mechitzos even though water passes above or below], like Rav taught:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Tavla):</span> Does a hanging Mechitzah permit carrying in a ruined house?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Chachamim gave this leniency only regarding water.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE FOUR AMOS ONE IS GIVEN TO WALK</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> He has only four Amos... [R. Yehudah says, he can go four Amos in any direction he wants].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah does not argue with Chachamim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Chachamim permit four in both directions. R. Yehudah permits four in any direction he chooses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> He is permitted eight by eight [Amos].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> They argue about where he may walk, but all agree that he may carry only within four Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where does the Torah allude to these four Amos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> "Shevu Ish Tachtav" - one must stay in an area equal to what is under himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much is under a person?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His body is three Amos, and we add one Amah for him to stretch his arms and legs.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, his body is three Amos. We add one Amah for him to take something from 'under' (next to) his feet [when he lies down] and put it 'above' his head.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between them?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir allows slightly more than four Amos, R. Yehudah allows [only] precisely four Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Mesharshiya (to his son):</span> Ask Rav Papa if we gauge by the person's own Amah (the distance from his elbow to the end of his middle finger), or by the Amah of Hekdesh (six Tefachim. It is the same for everyone);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he tells you that he gets four Amos of Hekdesh, ask how Og Melech ha'Bashan could manage!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he tells you that he gets his own Amos, ask why it was not taught in the Mishnah that lists things that depend on the person himself!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> If we will be so meticulous [about everything, we cannot answer everything.] We will cease to learn!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> He gets his own Amos. It was not taught in the Mishnah because it is not always true. One with small limbs [but average height] receives Amos of Hekdesh.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>OUTER CHATZEROS THAT WERE NOT ME'AREV TOGETHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If there are two people... [if there are three, and the middle one's Amos are covered by the others'... R. Shimon says, this is like three Chatzeros...]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must R. Shimon give an analogy?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He challenges Chachamim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He says, this is like three Chatzeros [in a row] open to each other and open to Reshus ha'Rabim. Why do you argue with me there [and forbid all of them], and agree with me here?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> There, there are many dwellers (it is hard to be careful not to carry things from the opposite Chatzer). Here, there are few.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the outer Chatzeros [were Me'arev with the middle Chatzer, it is permitted with them, they are permitted with it, and they are forbidden with each other].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since the outer Chatzeros were Me'arev with the middle one, they should all be like one!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> The case is, the middle Chatzer put an Eruv in each of the outer ones (it is as if it lives with them, but not vice-versa).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> We can even say that the outer Chatzeros put their Eruvin in the middle one, i.e. in different houses. (Therefore, they do not join.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">48b----------------------------------------48b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is like Beis Shamai!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> If five people gave for the Eruv and it was put in two Kelim, it is invalid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel are Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is even like Beis Hillel. Beis Hillel are Machshir only when it is in one house, but not if it is in two.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Avya):</span> Both answers are difficult!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Yehudah says that the middle Chatzer put an Eruv in each of the outer ones - once it put in one (e.g. the east Chatzer), they are like one. When it later puts an Eruv in the west Chatzer, it is like a Shali'ach for the east Chatzer [so now all of them should be permitted]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to Rav Sheshes, [since Eruv in different houses are invalid], it should be as if one of five people in a Chatzer forgot to be Me'arev. All are forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (for Rav Yehudah - Rav Ashi):</span> Since the outer Chatzeros were Me'arev with the middle one, but not with each other, this shows that they want to be Me'arev only with it, but not with each other!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (for Rav Sheshes - Rav Ashi):</span> Chachamim were lenient about Diyurin [to say that an Eruv makes it as if people live together, to allow being Me'arev together]. They did not say so to be stringent [to forbid when they put in different houses]!</p></div>
