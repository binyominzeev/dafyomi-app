<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Whenever R. Yehudah says in a Mishnah 'when is this?' or 'what is the case?', he does not argue. Rather, he explains the first Tana;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> When he says 'when is this?', he explains. When he says 'what is the case?', he argues.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against both of them):</span> [Sometimes] when he says 'when is this?', he argues!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are disqualified [from judging or testifying] - diceplayers (gamblers), those who lend on Ribis (usury), Mafrichei Yonim (they wager about whose bird will go faster; alternatively, they train their birds to lure other birds after them to steal them) and Socharei (those who sell) Shemitah produce.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> When is this? It is if they have no other profession. (They do not appreciate the toil of earning money.) If they have another profession, they are Kesherim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chachamim):</span> Whether or not he has a profession he is disqualified. (Gambling is Asmachta. It does not acquire. (The loser did not expect to lose; he does not have sufficient intent for the winner to acquire the money. Every time one wins, he steals! R. Yehudah holds that Asmachta acquires.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Beraisa is not Chachamim [of the Mishnah cited]. Rather, it is R. Yehudah according to R. Tarfon:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah citing R. Tarfon):</span> [If Reuven and Shimon saw a man approaching, and Reuven said 'I accept Nezirus if he is a Nazir', and Shimon said 'I accept Nezirus if he is not a Nazir')], neither Reuven nor Shimon is a Nazir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is because [acceptance of] Nezirus requires Hafla'ah (certainty). Likewise, Asmachta does not acquire!</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ERUV TECHUMIM ON BEHALF OF OTHERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> To make Eruv Techumim for many people, one designates a barrel [of food or drink] and says 'This is for everyone in the city who wants to go to the mourner's house or to the wedding feast';</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Anyone who accepted [to rely on the Eruv] before Shabbos may rely on it. One who accepted after dark may not, for one may not be Me'arev after dark.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yosef):</span> One may be Me'arev only in order to [go to] do a Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learn this from our Mishnah! 'This is for everyone in the city who wants to go to the mourner's house or to the wedding feast.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the Mishnah discusses a normal case, but it applies also to other cases. Rav Yosef teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Anyone who accepted before Shabbos...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This implies that [even regarding mid'Rabanan laws] Ein Breirah (one cannot stipulate for something to take effect contingent on future events). If Yesh Breirah, even accepting after dark should help. It reveals that retroactively he wanted the Eruv from before dark!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> No, the Mishnah distinguishes between <i>finding out about</i> the Eruv before or after dark. (We can use Breirah to say that retroactively he wanted it before dark only if he knew about it at the time.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHOSE ERUV PERMITS A CHILD?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> A woman's Eruv permits [also] her six year old son.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A woman's Eruv permits her son only if he needs his mother. (The following shows that this is before six!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A boy who does not need his mother is obligated in the Mitzvah of Sukah [in order to train him to fulfil Mitzvos].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When do we say that a boy does not need his mother?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> This is if his mother need not clean him after he eliminates.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> It is if he does not cry out 'mother' when he wakes up.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Even old children do this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, it is if he does not cry out 'mother, mother' [until she comes] when he wakes up.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What age is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a child of four or five. (Some mature faster than others).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">82b----------------------------------------82b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehoshua brei d'Rav Idi):</span> Rav Asi discusses a child whose father and mother were Me'arev for him in different directions. A boy of six prefers the company of his mother, therefore her Eruv permits him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A woman's Eruv permits her son only if he needs her. This is until six years. (Rav Yehoshua requires the parent to be Mezakeh for the child. The Beraisa gives one law for all children below six, and surely no Zikuy is needed for an infant!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Rav Yehoshua is refuted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refutes also Rav Asi! (It permits until, but not including, six. He permits even a six year old.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. It means Ad v'Ad Bichlal (up to and including six).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It refutes also R. Yanai and Reish Lakish! (They say that a child of four or five does not need his mother. Such a child is not permitted with his mother's Eruv, and this Beraisa permits even a six year old.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. A child of four or five does not need his mother if his father is around. The Beraisa permits a six year old whose father is not around, for he needs his mother.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> A man can be Me'arev on behalf of his minor sons and daughters and his male and female Kena'ani slaves with or without their <i>Da'as</i> (consent);</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He can be Me'arev on behalf of his male and female Kena'ani slaves and his minor sons and daughters with or without their Da'as, because they cannot acquire for themselves, only for him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>If any of them were Me'arev, and their master [or father or husband] was Me'arev for them, his Eruv takes effect, except for his wife, for she can protest.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is she different [than his adult children and Ivri slaves? He cannot be Me'arev without their Da'as, either!]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Indeed, it means except for his wife and those similar to her.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Both of them intend to be lenient. (R. Meir holds that people eat less during the week, for the food is less tasty. R.

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan ben Brokah):</span> It is a loaf one buys for a Pundiyon (one part in 48 of a Sela) when wheat sells for four Sa'im for a Sela;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Shimon):</span> It is two thirds of a loaf that is a third of a Kav. (A Kav is the volume of 24 eggs, one sixth of a Se'ah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Half of [such] a loaf is the size of a meal for Beis ha'Menuga. (If one stays in a house with Tzara'as long enough to eat this much, the clothes he is wearing become Tamei (Rashi; Me'iri - Avos ha'Tum'ah));</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>If one eats a quarter loaf of Tamei food, he is disqualified [from eating Terumah until he immerses].</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> It is two standard loaves of the area near the Papisa river.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Rabah's son Rav Yosef told Rav Yosef that his father held like R. Meir.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> [Our calculation was imprecise, because] a third of the price of bread is the grocer's mark-up. (Only two thirds are for the wheat.)</p></div>
