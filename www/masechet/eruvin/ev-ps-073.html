<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHAT DETERMINES RESIDENCE?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> It is where he sleeps.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Beraisa):</span> Shepherds, people who guard figs or other produce, and people who dwell in huts:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they normally sleep in the city, they are like city dwellers [regarding Shevisah];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If they normally sleep in the field, they have 2000 Amos in every direction [from there].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, without any doubt if we would bring their food to the field, they would prefer to eat there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I never heard this teaching [of Rav].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> You taught it to us regarding the following teaching!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If brothers eat at their father's table and sleep in their own houses, each of them must be Me'arev.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This shows that the place of sleeping determines [residence]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Yosef citing Rav Yehudah):</span> The case is, they receive Pras (are fed) from their father [but eat in their own houses].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If five co-wives or five slaves receive Pras from their husband or master [each has his or her own house in the Chatzer]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah ben Beseira permits the women [without an Eruv. They are drawn after the residence of their husband] and forbids the slaves;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah ben Bava permits the slaves and forbids the women. (Tosfos R. Peretz - no one else resides in the Chatzer. Surely, wives and slaves are not drawn after their husband or master more than sons are drawn after their father.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> R. Yehudah ben Bava learns from "v'Daniel bi'Sra Malka" - wherever a slave is, it is as if he is in the king's gate.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>We already taught whether a son is drawn after his father. (If the son eats (Rav) or sleeps (Shmuel) in his own place, he does not follow his father);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>R. Yehudah ben Beseira and R. Yehudah ben Bava argue about whether wives or slaves are drawn after their husband or master.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is a Talmid drawn after his Rebbi [if he receives Pras from him]?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When Rav learned by R. Chiya, he said 'we need not be Me'arev, for we rely on R. Chiya's table. R. Chiya said similarly when he learned by Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If five were Me'arev together, can one take the Eruv elsewhere (to join with another Chatzer), or must each be Me'arev?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> One can be Me'arev for all of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Brothers are like people who were Me'arev, yet our Mishnah requires each to be Me'arev!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> The case is, there are others in the Chatzer with them. Since others forbid them [unless they are Me'arev], they force each to be Me'arev by himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Seifa):</span> This is when they put their Eruv in another house. If the rest of the Chatzer brought their Eruv to the father's house, or if no one else lives in the Chatzer, they need not be Me'arev. (This implies that in the Reisha, there are others in the Chatzer.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE RESIDENCE OF TALMIDIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> If Talmidim eat in an inn in the valley and sleep in the Beis Medrash, from where do we measure their Techum?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> We measure from the Beis Medrash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one put Eruv Techumim within 2000, and came and lodged in his house, we measure from the Eruv (the food), even though he sleeps in his house!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (In both cases, he would prefer to eat and sleep in the same place, so we measure from there.) There, it is clear that he would prefer to sleep where his Eruv is [for he desires to go in that direction]. Here it is clear that Talmidim would prefer to eat in the Beis Medrash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> If a father and his children, or a Rebbi and his Talmidim live in an inner Chatzer (Rashi. Tosfos - they are the only residents in a Mavoy. Each has a house and Chatzer open to the Mavoy. Food is provided for the children or Talmidim, but they eat in their own houses,) are they considered like an individual or like a Rabim [for the following laws]?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they are like an individual, they need not be Me'arev, hence they cannot forbid the outer Chatzer. A Rabim must be Me'arev. If they are not, they forbid the outer Chatzer (Rashi. Tosfos - if they are like a Rabim, they must be Me'arev, lest the law of Eruv be forgotten);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If you will say that they are like an individual, does a Lechi or Korah permit the Mavoy? (It permits a Mavoy only if houses and [at least two] Chatzeros are open to the Mavoy. If the Chatzeros belong to a father and son, are they like one Chatzer or two?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda - Beraisa):</span> If a father and his children, or a Rebbi and his Talmidim live in a Chatzer [without anyone else], they are considered like an individual. They need not be Me'arev. [Even so, since they are open to the Mavoy,] a Lechi or Korah permits their Mavoy.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE NEED FOR ERUV CHATZEROS AS WELL AS SHITUF</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If five Chatzeros open to each other and to a Mavoy:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Chatzeros made Eruvim [with each other] but were not Mishtatef in the Mavoy, the Chatzeros are permitted, and the Mavoy is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">73b----------------------------------------73b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If they were Mishtatef in the Mavoy, everything is permitted. (The Gemara will explain the entire Mishnah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If they were Me'arev in the Chatzeros and Mishtatef in the Mavoy, but one person forgot to be Me'arev in the Chatzer, they are permitted everywhere;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one person forgot to be Mishtatef in the Mavoy, the Chatzeros are permitted, and the Mavoy is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is because the relationship of the Mavoy to the Chatzeros is like Chatzeros to houses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Observation:</span> The Tana [of the Reisha] is R. Meir, who requires Eruvei Chatzeros in addition to Shitufei Mavo'os.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The second clause says that if they were Mishtatef in the Mavoy, everything is permitted. This is like Chachamim, who say that it suffices to be Me'arev <i>or</i> Mishtatef!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (This is also like R. Meir.) It means that if they <i>also</i> were Mishtatef in the Mavoy [in addition to Eruvei Chatzeros], everything is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The third clause says that if they were Me'arev and Mishtatef, but one forgot to be Me'arev, they are permitted everywhere;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the one who forgot was not Mevatel, why are they permitted?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He was Mevatel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The fourth clause says, if one forgot to be Mishtatef in the Mavoy, the Chatzeros are permitted, and the Mavoy is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he was Mevatel, why is the Mavoy forbidden?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Meir holds that Bitul does not work in a Mavoy.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> [...R. Gamliel said...] he (the Tzeduki) was Mevatel his Reshus [in the Mavoy] to you!'</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of objection:</span> We must say that [in the fourth clause] he was not Mevatel. Surely, also in the third clause he was not Mevatel!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (1)):</span> He was not Mevatel. (We must say that they are permitted because we rely on the Shituf, like Chachamim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> (The Seifa says that Eruvei Chatzeros do not permit the Mavoy. It is like R. Meir.) Are the Reisha and Seifa R. Meir, and the middle (third) clause is Chachamim?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The entire Mishnah is R. Meir. He requires Eruvin and Shituf lest children forget about Eruvin. Here we are not concerned, because most were Me'arev.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>RAV'S OPINION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Rav):</span> The text of the Mishnah does <i>not</i> say that the Chatzeros open to each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Also Rav Kahana said so, either himself or in the name of Rav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Why shouldn't it say that they open to each other?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> He holds that Shituf must be brought from each Chatzer to the Mavoy, and then to the Chatzer in which it will be placed. (If Chatzeros open to each other, we always forbid, lest the Shituf be brought from Chatzer to Chatzer, and not through the Mavoy.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven had two neighbors [in the Mavoy], and each owned wine in partnership with Reuven, they need not be Me'arev [even though the wine was not brought through the Mavoy]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the wine was brought in [to the Mavoy] and out [to the Chatzer in which it was left - Tosfos].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> To Mishtatef in a Mavoy, [one is Mezakeh...]</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah does not require bringing it through the Mavoy!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There also, it was brought in and out.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rabah bar Chanan):</span> Will you say that if one is Mezakeh bread in his basket for Shituf, it does not help [because it was not brought through the Mavoy]?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Indeed, it does not!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav himself taught that if a group was eating together and Shabbos came, they can rely on the bread on the table for Eruv;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Some say, they rely on it for Shituf.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> They do not argue. If they were eating in a house, they rely on it for Eruv. If they were eating in a Chatzer, they rely on it for Shituf [even though it was not brought through the Mavoy]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (c)):</span> Rav holds that a Lechi or Korah permits a Mavoy only if houses and Chatzer<i>os</i> are open to the Mavoy. (If the Chatzeros open to each other, they are considered like only one.)</p></div>
