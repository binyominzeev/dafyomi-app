<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>HOW MUCH AREA IS PERMITTED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> His first law (one or two people) is like R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah, and his last law [for three] is like Chachamim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is reasonable, because also R. Yehudah holds like his son regarding the first law. (He says so explicitly (16b) regarding an 'individual'. It is reasonable that this refers also to two, and the law of a caravan applies to three or more.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal citing Rav):</span> Three [people] in five [times the area of a Beis Se'ah] are forbidden. in seven they are permitted (this will be explained).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Talmidim:</span> Did Rav really say this?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Gidal:</span> I swear that he did!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> This is not hard to explain. If three need an area of six, and they surrounded seven, they are permitted all seven. However, if they need only five, and they surrounded seven (this is Beis Sa'atayim more than needed), they are forbidden even in five. (Gra's alternate text - if they need only three, and they surrounded five, they are forbidden even in five.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> ... Just there may not be Beis Sa'atayim free.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It means that it may not be empty of people. (We forbid only if there is Beis Sa'atayim for each person and an extra Beis Sa'atayim, regardless of what they need. Why does Rav Ashi forbids three people in seven Sa'im if they need only five? Only one Se'ah is empty of people (extra)!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it may not be empty of Kelim (i.e. unneeded).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A CHANGE IN STATUS ON SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna or R. Yitzchak):</span> If there were three people and one died [on Shabbos], or if there were two people and another came [on Shabbos], their status (individuals or a caravan) depends on the number of people at the start of Shabbos;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Huna and R. Yitzchak):</span> It depends on the number of people currently there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> [The following shows that] Rav Huna holds that it depends on the number of people at the start of Shabbos:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> If one was Me'arev through an opening or window and it became sealed [on Shabbos], what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> Once Shabbos was permitted, the Heter stands.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav Huna and R. Yitzchak argue like R. Yosi and R. Yehudah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If [on Shabbos] a Chatzer or house was breached on two sides (i.e. a corner), or if the Lechi or Korah was removed from a Mavoy, they are permitted for that Shabbos and forbidden in the future;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi says, if they are permitted for that Shabbos they are permitted in the future. If they are forbidden in the future they are forbidden for that Shabbos. (The Gemara (95a) says that R. Yosi forbids.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav Huna holds like R. Yehudah, and R. Yitzchak holds like R. Yosi!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Even R. Yosi can hold like Rav Huna. R. Yosi forbids only when there are not Mechitzos. Here the Mechitzos are intact!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Even R. Yehudah can hold like R. Yitzchak. R. Yehudah permits only when there are enough dwellers. Here, we lack dwellers!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> It can be horizontal <i>or</i> vertical.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim do not argue with the first Tana!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about whether or not this is permitted for an individual in a settled area. (The first Tana permits an individual similar to a caravan, i.e. on the road. Chachamim permit in every case.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>LENIENCIES OF AN ENCAMPMENT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Four leniencies were given to an [army] encampment:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They may bring wood from any place [without concern for theft], they are exempt from washing [before eating], from [tithing] Demai (doubtfully tithed produce) and from making an Eruv.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> An encampment going out to an optional war (as opposed to the Mitzvah to conquer Eretz Yisrael) may steal dry wood;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yehudah ben Teima says, also, they may camp wherever they want. If someone is killed, he is buried there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> They may take dry wood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Yehoshua enacted this leniency [not only for soldiers]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Yehoshua made [the division of Eretz Yisrael conditional on] 10 laws - people may graze animals in [others'] forests; people may collect wood from [others'] fields...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Yehoshua stipulated about prickly shrubs and bushes. Our Mishnah permits other trees [for an encampment].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Yehoshua stipulated about attached wood. Our Mishnah permits detached.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Yehoshua stipulated about wet wood. Our Mishnah permits dry wood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah ben Teima):</span> Also, they may camp wherever they want. If someone is killed, he is buried there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious! [Another of Yehoshua's stipulations was that] a Mes Mitzvah (a corpse with no one to bury it) acquires its place! (It is buried there.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah permits even if there are people (heirs) to bury it.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">17b----------------------------------------17b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Mes Mitzvah is one without anyone to bury it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one calls out and people answer, this is not a Mes Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Mes Mitzvah does not acquire its place!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Mes was found on a paved road, it is buried to the right or left side of the road (whichever place will cause less loss};</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If one side is an unplowed field and the other is a plowed field, we bury in the former. If one field is plowed and the other is seeded, we bury in the former;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If both sides are similar, the corpse may be buried in either.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Bivi):</span> The Beraisa discusses a corpse across the width of the road. We do not bury it there, lest people who pass over become Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since we cannot bury it in its place, we may move it in any direction.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>LENIENCIES OF AN ENCAMPMENT (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They are exempt from washing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This applies only to washing before eating, but Mayim Acharonim (after eating, before Birkas ha'Mazon) is an obligation.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya bar Ashi):</span> Why is Mayim Acharonim obligatory?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is due to Sodom salt, which blinds the eyes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> About one grain of Sodom salt is found in 30 Sa'im of [regular] salt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> If one measures out salt, must he wash his hands?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Surely, he must!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They are exempt from [tithing] Demai.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may feed Demai to soldiers [whom the city must feed] or to poor people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna - Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> We may not feed Demai to poor people or to soldiers;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Beis Hillel permit both of these.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They are exempt from making an Eruv.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(D'Vei R. Yanai):</span> They are exempt only from Eruvei Chatzeros, but not from Eruv Techumim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya - Beraisa):</span> One is lashed mid'Oraisa for leaving the Techum without an Eruv.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yonason):</span> [The Torah does not say <i>'Lo</i> Yetzei Ish mi'Mkomo ba'Yom ha'Shevi'i', rather, "<i>Al</i> Yetzei..." One is not lashed for a Lav of "Al"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> Surely you do not exempt [from lashes] one who transgresses [the Lav of asking a sorcerer to conjure up the dead,] "Al Tifnu El ha'Ovos v'El ha'Yid'onim" [for this reason! However, some exempt because moving lips is not an action.]</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yonason asks why one is lashed for "Al Yetzei" because this Lav also forbids Hotza'ah, which is Chayav Misas Beis Din. If one can be killed for a Lav, one is never lashed for it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> It does not say 'Al Yotzi', rather, "Al Yetzei." The Lav forbids only Techumim. ("Lo Sa'aseh Chol Melachah" forbids Hotza'ah.)</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK #2 OSIN PASIN</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>PASEI BIRA'OS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> We may make Pasim (planks) around Bira'os (wells, to permit carrying inside), i.e. four Deyumadim (L-shaped corner posts) that look like eight (like the diagram in Rashi 15a);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Meir says, we make eight Pasim that look like 12, i.e. four Deyumadim and four straight planks (one in the middle of each side).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Pasim must be [at least] 10 Tefachim tall and six Tefachim wide. They can be any thickness;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Meir says, the distance between them is [at most - <a href=ev-ps-appendix.htm#9>see note 9 in Appendix] the width of two teams of three [bulls each];</p></div></a>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it is the width of two teams of four.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The bulls in each team are tied together. We consider the width necessary to allow one [team] to enter at the same time that the other leaves. (I.e. there is some room in between. Therefore, we allow for each bull [one and two thirds] Amos <i>Sochekos</i>, i.e. composed of Tefachim in which there are small spaces between the fingers.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>The Pasim may be as close to the well as desired, on condition that a cow can enter Rosho v'Rubo and drink.</p></div>
