<p class="dedicationbox">ERUVIN 26 (23 Nisan) - dedicated l'Iluy Nishmas the father of Mr. Avy Reichman Z'L of Queens, NY, Dovid ben Avraham Z'L, by Avy's children. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE REISH GALUSA'S ORCHARD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rava knocked down the sticks. (He held that they are not needed, for the Achsadra makes the orchard Hukaf l'Dirah.) Rav Papa and Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua collected the sticks [lest Rav Huna bar Chinena put them back. This is Rashi's preferred explanation (DH Lehara).]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina - Beraisa):</span> We measure [the Techum of] a new city from where it is settled. We measure an old city from its wall;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A new city is one that was surrounded and afterwards settled. If it was settled and afterwards surrounded, it is considered old.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Also this orchard is considered [Hukaf Lo l'Shem Dirah, for it was] surrounded and later settled! (The Achsadra was made later. Rav Papa and Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua retracted and also asked against Rava.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Rav Asi taught that walls that builders make [temporarily, for shade] are not considered walls.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This shows that a wall made [temporarily] for privacy is not considered a Mechitzah. The same applies to the Achsadra!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Rav Huna taught that a wall made to guard [e.g. Kelim] is not considered a Mechitzah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rabah bar Avuha obligated each neighborhood in the city of Mechuza to be Me'arev by itself. (He did not allow all to be Me'arev together, even though they were surrounded by a wall, for the wall guarded date pits (stored for animals) in ditches between the Mavo'os.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The walls are like Mechitzos for the sake of guarding! (They are invalid. Therefore, they do not permit to be Me'arev together.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Reish Galusa:</span> "Chachamim Hemah Lehara u'Leheitiv Lo Yada'u." (Rav Papa and Rav Huna helped destroy the path of sticks, and now they say that I am forbidden without it)!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>REBBI ELIEZER'S LAWS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Ila'i):</span> R. Eliezer [permits] even if it is a Beis Kor (30 Sa'im).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Our Mishnah is unlike Chananyah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chananyah):</span> Even if it is 40 [Beis] Sa'im, like the yard in back of the king's palace [it is permitted, for people stroll there. It is considered Dirah.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Both of them expound the same verse - "va'Yhi Yeshayahu Lo Yatza Chatzer ha'Tichonah"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is written 'ha'Ir', but we read it "Chatzer." This teaches that the king's backyard is like medium cities. (Even though it was not Hukaf l'Dirah, it is like a Chatzer, and one may carry inside);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer holds that a medium city is 30 Sa'im. Chananyah holds that it is 40.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was Yeshayah in the backyard?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Chizkiyah fell sick, and Yeshayah arranged for Talmidim to learn in front of his door [to prevent the Satan (angel of death) from entering];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This teaches that if a Chachamim falls sick, Talmidim should learn in front of his door.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is wrong. This could entice the Satan!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Ila'i):</span> R. Eliezer says that if one forgot to contribute towards the Eruv in the Chatzer, his house is forbidden [to him, but they are permitted].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Kahana) Question (Mishnah):</span> If someone forgot to contribute towards the Eruv in the Chatzer, his house is forbidden to him and to them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua citing Rav Sheshes):</span> That Mishnah is Chachamim who argue with R. Eliezer;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">26b----------------------------------------26b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer holds that one who is Mevatel his Reshus in the Chatzer [without specifying about his house] is also Mevatel his Reshus in his house. Chachamim hold that he is Mevatel only his Chatzer, but not his house.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rachbah and Rav Huna bar Chinena):</span> He teaches about one of five people in a Chatzer who forgot to be Me'arev. R. Eliezer holds that it suffices to be Mevatel [once] to all the others. Chachamim require him to be Mevatel to each one.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the following Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one of five people in a Chatzer forgot to be Me'arev, he need not be Mevatel to each of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Tivyomi) Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the following Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one of five people in a Chatzer forgot to be Me'arev, he need not be Mevatel to each of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna bar Yehudah citing Rav Sheshes):</span> It is like R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions (Rav Papa):</span> According to R. Eliezer, if he said that he is not Mevatel [Reshus of his house], what is the law? According to Chachamim, if he said that he is Mevatel, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Is R. Eliezer's reason that one who is Mevatel his [Reshus in the] Chatzer [without specifying] is also Mevatel his [Reshus in his] house [therefore it is permitted to them]? However, if he explicitly said that he does not, he does not!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps he holds that one cannot live in a house without access to a Chatzer. Therefore, Bitul of his Chatzer is automatically Bitul of his house, even if he says otherwise!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Do Chachamim hold that one who is Mevatel his Chatzer [without specifying] is not Mevatel his house [therefore it is forbidden to them], but if he explicitly said that he does, he does?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Or, perhaps they hold that a person does not totally abandon his house and Chatzer and be like a guest of the others. Therefore, even if he says that he does, we ignore his words!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Both of them hold that if he specifies what he is Mevatel, it takes effect.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Ila'i):</span> R. Eliezer says that one fulfils the Mitzvah of Maror with Arkavlin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> It is a thick fiber that grows around date trees.</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK #3 B'CHOL ME'ARVIN</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>FOODS AND PLACES VALID FOR ERUVIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may make an Eruv [Techumim - Tosfos; Rashi - or Eruv Chatzeros] and be Mishtatef [in a Mavoy] with any food except for water and salt;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Any food may be bought with money of Ma'aser Sheni, except for water and salt;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If one vowed not to eat food, he is permitted [only] water and salt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>One may be Me'arev on behalf of a Nazir with wine, and on behalf of a Yisrael with Terumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Sumchus says, one must be Me'arev with Chulin [for a Yisrael].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>One may be Me'arev on behalf of a Kohen in a Beis ha'Pras (a field in which a grave was plowed. Mid'Rabanan, it is forbidden to Kohanim like a cemetery. One who walks through is deemed Tamei, lest he move a bone, unless he crouches down and blows the dirt before each step to reveal bones that might be there.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, one may be Me'arev for a Kohen even in a cemetery, because he could shield from Tum'as Ohel [in a box or coach], enter and eat it.</p></div>
