<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Chanin):</span> Had Rabah heard the following Beraisa he would have retracted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> [On Shabbos] one may not walk to the end of his field to see what it requires;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Similarly, one may not to go to the end of the city towards the end of Shabbos in order to go to the bathhouse right after Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He heard it, yet he did not retract;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There, it is clear why he goes there. Here, it is not clear;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he is a Chacham, people could assume that he was engrossed in learning [and did not notice where he walks, like Nechemyah brei d'Rav Chanilai (43b)];</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If he is an ignoramus, people could assume that he was looking for a lost donkey.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one was Me'arev through walking on the first day, he may be Me'arev through walking on the second. If he was Me'arev with bread on the first day, he may be Me'arev with bread on the second;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If one was Me'arev with bread on the first day, he may be Me'arev through walking on the second;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If he was Me'arev through walking on the first day, he may not be Me'arev with bread on the second, for one may not be Me'arev with bread for the first time [on Yom Tov, for Shabbos].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> When one is Me'arev with bread on both days, he must be Me'arev with the same bread.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> He takes the Eruv on Erev Yom Tov, remains there until nightfall, and takes it home with him. The next day takes it back, and remains there until nightfall, then he may eat it and return.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Implied Question:</span> All should agree that the Mishnah forbids Hachanah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer):</span> Rabanan (Abaye and Rabah bar Rav Chanin, who challenged Rabah) hold that the Mishnah merely gives practical advice (so one will not lose his Eruv).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE KEDUSHAH OF THE TWO DAYS OF ROSH HASHANAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> [In Chutz la'Aretz, where people do not hear about which day was made Rosh Chodesh until later in the month,] if one fears that Rosh Hashanah will be [a day later because Elul will be] Me'ubar (30 days; it is normally 29), he can make two [different] Eruvin [because only one of them takes effect, for the day that is really Yom Tov. The other day is Chol, and requires no Eruv];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He can make the Eruv for the first day [of Safek Yom Tov] in the east, and for the second day in the west, or vice-versa;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He can be Me'arev just for the first day, and the second day he is like residents of his city, or vice-versa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chachamim disagree.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Further, R. Yehudah says that one can stipulate about a basket [of Tevel] on Yom [Tov] Rishon. (He separates the proper amounts, and says 'if today is Chol, these are Terumah and Ma'aseros.') On Yom Sheni he [repeats this declaration and] eats it;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Similarly, if an egg was laid on Yom Rishon, one may eat it on Yom Sheni. (If Yom Rishon was Chol, the Hachanah was on Yom Chol. If Yom Sheni was Chol, we are not concerned for Hachanah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Chachamim disagree with R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Dosa ben Hurkinas says, on Rosh Hashanah the Shali'ach Tzibur says '...this day of Rosh Chodesh, be it today or tomorrow. (He says so on the first day. On the second day, he says '...be it today or yesterday');</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Chachamim disagree.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Who are the Chachamim that disagree with R. Yehudah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> It is R. Yosi:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Chachamim agree with R. Eliezer that if one fears lest Elul be Me'ubar, he can make two Eruvin in opposite directions, one for each day. Alternatively, he can be Me'arev just for the first day or just for the second;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi forbids.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> (One may not do Melachah on the 30th of Elul, lest witnesses who saw the new moon come, and Beis Din will make the day Rosh Hashanah.) Don't you agree that if witnesses came after Minchah, we treat the rest of the day like Yom Tov, and also the next day? (This shows that both days have Kedushah!)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">39b----------------------------------------39b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> This is only so that [in future years] people will not treat the Kedushah of the first day lightly. (Really, if witnesses come after Minchah, the first day is Chol.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Further, R. Yehudah says...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>We must teach the argument about all three laws;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had we taught only about an Eruv, one might have thought that here R. Yehudah permits, because he does not actively do anything, but he would forbid the basket of Tevel, for it looks like he fixes it [on Yom Tov];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If we taught only these two cases, one might have thought R. Yehudah permits them because there is no need to decree. However, he would forbid an egg due to fruits that fell from a tree or juice that exuded from food [lest one harvest or squeeze on Yom Tov].</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE TWO DAYS OF YOM TOV OF CHUTZ LA'ARETZ</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If one had two baskets of Tevel, on Yom [Tov] Rishon he says 'if today is Chol, this basket is Terumah on (exempts) the other one. If today is Kodesh, my words should have no effect'. The next day, he repeats this declaration, and then he may eat the Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yosi forbids.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi forbids also regarding Yom Tov Sheni of Chutz la'Aretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A deer was trapped [by Nochrim] in the Reish Galusa's house on Yom Tov Rishon, and it was slaughtered on Yom Tov Sheni. Rav Nachman and Rav Chisda ate from it, but Rav Sheshes did not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Rav Sheshes does not wish to eat deer meat! (There is no reason to forbid. Yesterday was Chol, or today is!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Sheshes):</span> It is forbidden due to Isi's Beraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Isi - Beraisa):</span> R. Yosi forbids also Yom Tov Sheni of Chutz la'Aretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> Perhaps it means that R. Yosi forbids also Yom Tov Sheni of Rosh Hashanah in Chutz la'Aretz!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, it should have said 'Yom Tov Sheni <i>in</i> Chutz la'Aretz.' '<i>Of</i> Chutz la'Aretz' connotes other Yomim Tovim, which are observed for two days only in Chutz la'Aretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Asi):</span> Perhaps it means that R. Yosi makes the two days of Yom Tov of Chutz la'Aretz like the two days of Rosh Hashanah according to Chachamim, who permit!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes (to Rabah bar Shmuel):</span> Did you learn anything about the two Kedushos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Shmuel - Beraisa):</span> R. Yosi agrees about the two days of Yom Tov of Chutz la'Aretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes:</span> If you see Rav Nachman and Rav Chisda, do not tell them. (I am ashamed that I erred.)</p></div>
