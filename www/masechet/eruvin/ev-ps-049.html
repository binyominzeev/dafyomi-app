<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE CHACHAMIM'S OPINION ABOUT THE THREE CHATZEROS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Rashi) (Rav):</span> This is R. Shimon's opinion. Chachamim say that [whether the Eruvin were placed in the middle Chatzer or the outer Chatzeros,] one Reshus (the middle Chatzer) can be used by two Reshuyos (a Kli that was Shoves in either outer Chatzer may be used there. We are not concerned lest someone from the other outer Chatzer use it, for they were not Me'arev together), but two Reshuyos (the outer Chatzeros) may not be used by one Reshus. (The middle Chatzer may not use even their own Kelim there, lest they use Kelim of the outer Chatzer.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (most Rishonim) (Rav):</span> This is R. Shimon's opinion. Chachamim say that one Reshus may use two (the middle Chatzer may use its Kelim in the outer Chatzeros. They will not take Kelim of an outer Chatzer to the other, for people recognize their own Kelim), but two Reshuyos may not use one (an outer Chatzer may not use its Kelim in the middle Chatzer. If everyone would be permitted there, an outer Chatzer might come to use Kelim of the other outer Chatzer). (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Chachamim do not allow even this. Only R. Shimon does. Chachamim forbid all [transfer between the] three Chatzeros.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Shmuel - Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> This is like three Chatzeros open to each other and open to Reshus ha'Rabim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the outer Chatzeros were Me'arev with the middle Chatzer, each may bring food from its house to the middle, eat, and return its leftovers to its house;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, all three of them are forbidden [with each other].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This is like Shmuel taught elsewhere;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If a Chatzer between two Mavo'os was Me'arev with both of them, it is forbidden with both of them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it was not Me'arev with both of them, it forbids both of them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If it normally used [only] one of them, it forbids only that one.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> If it was Me'arev with the one it normally uses, this permits the other one.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> If the one it normally uses was Me'arev by itself, and the other Mavoy and this Chatzer were not Me'arev, we force this Chatzer to use that Mavoy [lest it forbid the one that was Me'arev]. In such a case, Kofin Al Midas Sedom. (We force one to allow another to benefit, if he himself will not lose.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>AN ERUV UNITES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If someone is strict about his Eruv (unwilling to let a member of the Chatzer take it), it is invalid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is called Eruv. (This connotes a [friendly] union.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> It is an Eruv, just he is called stingy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one divided his Eruv (put it in two Kelim), it is invalid. (It is not a union!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is like Beis Shamai!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> If five people gave for the Eruv and it was put in two Kelim, it is invalid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel are Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is even like Beis Hillel. They are Machshir only when the Kli was full, and he was forced to use another Kli. They agree that if one deliberately divides it among two Kelim that it is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must Rav Yehudah teach both of these?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He must teach both. From the first, we would only know that if one is strict, his Eruv is invalid. We would not knew about one who divided it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>From the second, we would only know that a divided Eruv is invalid. We would not know about one who is strict.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba):</span> Surely, Shmuel is Machshir a divided Eruv. He taught that the host (in whose house the Eruv is put) need not contribute to the Eruv!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Even though the host's own bread is in a different Kli, it is considered to be part of the Eruv. The same applies if the Eruv itself is in two Kelim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the Eruv is valid even if the host has no bread;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Through Eruv, it is considered as if everyone dwells in this house. The host truly dwells there!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Eruv works through acquisition. (The host makes them partners in his house.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, people should give money for an Eruv!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Not everyone has money on Erev Shabbos (but everyone has bread at this time).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If someone gave money, it should be a valid Eruv!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We decree that it is invalid, lest people think that an Eruv must be through money, and when people lack money, they will not Me'arev with bread, and the law of Eruv will be forgotten.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> Eruv works through Dirah. (It is as if everyone lives in the host's house.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these explanations?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about whether or not one may transfer ownership of the Eruv through a Kli (Chalifin), whether or not the Eruv must be worth a Perutah, and whether or not a minor can be Me'arev. (Chalifin is valid for acquisition, but less than a Perutah and a child are not. For Dirah, it suffices that [the proper quantity of] food is there. Chalifin does not suffice.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">49b----------------------------------------49b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> A Beraisa is difficult for both opinions!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If five members of a Chatzer were Me'arev, one of them can take the Eruv elsewhere [to join with another Chatzer].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>(Why does this help for the entire Chatzer? Only the one who took it acquired. Only he has Dirah in the other Chatzer!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah, for himself and Shmuel):</span> The one who took it was a Shali'ach on behalf of his entire Chatzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DECLARING SHEVISAH FROM A DISTANCE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Chanina ben Antigonus):</span> If one was traveling and it was [getting] dark for him [on Erev Shabbos], and he saw a fence or tree and said 'my Shevisah is under it', his words have no effect;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he said 'my Shevisah is at the trunk', he may walk 2000 Amos to the tree, and another 2000 Amos from the trunk to his house, 4000 Amos in all after dark.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If he did not see a fence or tree, or did not know the Halachah, and said 'my Shevisah is where I am', he gets 2000 Amos in every direction, i.e. a circle [of radius 2000];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Chachamim say, he gets a square [of side 4000], he gains the corners. (He may walk 2000 Amos north [or south], and additionally 2000 east [or west].)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This is like it was taught, that an Oni [who lacks bread, like this traveler] can be Me'arev through walking;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Meir says, only an Oni can do so;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, the same applies to an Ashir;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>An Eruv with bread is a leniency for Ashirim, so they need not walk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the meaning of 'his words have no effect'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> His words have no effect at all. He may not even go to the tree;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> His words do not permit him to return home, but he may go to the tree. He is in Chamar Gamal with respect to the entire area under the tree (his Shevisah is somewhere in this area. We do not know exactly where it is. His house is more than 2000 Amos from part of the tree):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he wants to go north, he gets 2000 Amos from the [part of this area furthest] south. If he wants to go south, we measure from the north.</p></div>
