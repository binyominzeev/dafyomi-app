<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>AN ERUV IN A GRAVE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> One may be Me'arev for a Tahor Kohen with Tahor Terumah in a grave.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Granted, a Kohen can go there in a coach or box. However, once the Terumah was put on the grave, it became Tamei! (No one may eat it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it [is produce that] was never Huchshar, or [bread that] was kneaded with fruit juice [not among the seven liquids that are Machshir].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can the Kohen take the Terumah? (He may not put his hand over a Mes. If a normal Kli passes over a Mes, it becomes an Av ha'Tum'ah, and it would be Metamei him!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He takes it using a wooden Kli without a receptacle. (It is not Mekabel Tum'ah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Kli towers over a Mes! (It is Metamei the one holding it if a square Tefach of the Kli towers over a Mes, or [mid'Rabanan] even if it is a pole of circumference at least a Tefach.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds the Kli on its edge. (Less than a square Tefach towers over the grave.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why do Chachamim forbid? (We understand that they forbid not only in a cemetery, rather, even in a single grave, even though he can get close to it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They forbid acquiring Shevisah with Isurei Hana'ah. (One may not benefit from a grave.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Yehudah permit this?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that Mitzvos Lav Leihanos Nitnu (fulfilling Mitzvos is not considered benefit regarding Isurei Hana'ah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava taught that Mitzvos Lav Leihanos Nitnu. Do the Tana'im argue about this?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (for Rava):</span> No, all agree that Lav Leihanos Nitnu. R. Yehudah holds that we are Me'arev only for a Mitzvah. Chachamim permit to be Me'arev even for Reshus (an optional matter).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>Question Rav Yosef taught that we are Me'arev only for a Mitzvah. Do Tana'im argue about this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (for Rav Yosef):</span> No. All agree that we Me'arev only for a Mitzvah, and that Mitzvos Lav Leihanos Nitnu;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah holds that once he acquired Shevisah, he does not need the food. (Even though the grave guards the Eruv, this does not benefit him);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim hold that he wants the food to be guarded, in case he will want to eat it. (He benefits from the grave.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHICH FOODS MAY ONE USE FOR AN ERUV?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may be Me'arev with Demai (doubtfully tithed produce), Ma'aser Rishon from which Terumah was taken, or Ma'aser Sheni or Hekdesh that was redeemed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Kohanim may be Me'arev with Chalah [or Terumah];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One may not be Me'arev with Tevel, Ma'aser Rishon from which Terumah was not taken, or Ma'aser Sheni or Hekdesh that was not redeemed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> [Our Mishnah permits Chalah only to a Kohen. It is like Sumchus, who requires that the food is permitted to the Me'arev, yet it allows Demai.] It is forbidden [for most people] to eat Demai!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If one would make all his possessions Hefker, he would be poor and hence permitted to eat Demai. Therefore, one may be Me'arev with it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may feed Demai to an Oni or to soldiers [Yisraelim, whom the city must feed].</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">31b----------------------------------------31b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna - Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> We may not feed Demai to an Oni or to soldiers;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Beis Hillel permit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [One may be Me'arev with] Ma'aser Rishon from which Terumah was taken...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, a Levi received Ma'aser Rishon from sheaves and separated Terumas Ma'aser from it, but Terumah Gedolah was not taken;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> If a Levi received Ma'aser Rishon from sheaves, it is exempt from Terumah Gedolah. "Va'Haremosem Mimenu Terumas Hash-m Ma'aser Min ha'Ma'aser" - a Levi must separate [only Terumas] Ma'aser Min ha'Ma'aser, but not Terumah Gedolah and Terumas Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If so, the verse should exempt even if he received Ma'aser Rishon from a Kri (pile of grain)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> In this case we apply "mi'Kol Maseroseichem Tarimu."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (The verses do not specify what to include and what to exclude.) Perhaps we should exempt Ma'aser from a Kri, and obligate Ma'aser from sheaves!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We obligate Ma'aser from a Kri because it is considered Degen (grain, from which Terumah must be given. Sheaves are not called Degen.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [One may be Me'arev with] Ma'aser Sheni or Hekdesh that was redeemed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the principal was given, but he did not add a Chomesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah teaches that the redemption is valid even without the Chomesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not be Me'arev with Tevel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah forbids even Tevel mid'Rabanan, e.g. it grew in a flowerpot without a hole. (It does not nurture from the ground.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [One may not be Me'arev with] Ma'aser Rishon from which Terumah was not taken.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious! (It is like Tevel.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, a Levi received Ma'aser Rishon from a Kri. (Terumas Ma'aser was taken but Terumah Gedolah was not taken);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought [that it is exempt from Terumah Gedolah] like the assumption of Rav Papa's question. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so, like Abaye's answer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [One may not be Me'arev with] Ma'aser Sheni or Hekdesh that was not redeemed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, they were redeemed, but improperly;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Ma'aser Sheni was redeemed on an Asimon (a blank coin). The Torah requires "v'<i>Tzar</i>ta ha'Kesef b'Yadecha", a [minted] coin with a Tzurah (form).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Hekdesh was redeemed onto land, and not onto money;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It says that one will give money, "v'Kam Lo." (Only then the Hekdesh will be redeemed, and become his.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SENDING AN ERUV WITH A SHALI'ACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven sent an Eruv with any of the following, it is invalid: a child, lunatic, deaf person or with one who does not acknowledge [the enactment of] Eruvin;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he told Shimon [a healthy adult] to receive the Eruv from him [and be Me'arev, i.e. place it for an Eruv], it is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Rav Huna allows a child to collect the Eruv!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He permits this for Eruv Chatzeros. Our Mishnah forbids this for Eruv Techumim. (Rashi - a child lacks 'power' to acquire Shevisah. Tosfos - we are more stringent about Eruv Techumim, because a verse (an Asmachta) supports it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ...Or with one who does not acknowledge Eruvin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To whom does this refer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It refers to Kusim (Nochrim whom Sancheriv settled in place of the 10 exiled Shevatim. They later converted, but did not follow Divrei Chachamim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he told Shimon to receive the Eruv from him, it is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest the [first] Shali'ach did not bring it to Shimon!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Chisda answered [elsewhere] that we discuss when Reuven sees [the carrier bring it to Shimon]. The same answer applies here.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest Shimon was not Me'arev!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yechi'el answered [elsewhere] that there is a Chazakah (established nature of people) that a [proper] Shali'ach fulfils his mission. This applies also here.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To what questions did Rav Chisda and Rav Yechi'el give these answers?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven put an Eruv on a monkey or elephant and it took it, the Eruv is invalid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he told Shimon to receive the Eruv from it, it is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest the animal did not bring it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> The case is, Reuven sees the animal bring it to him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest Shimon was not Me'arev!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yechi'el):</span> There is a Chazakah that a Shali'ach fulfils his mission.</p></div>
