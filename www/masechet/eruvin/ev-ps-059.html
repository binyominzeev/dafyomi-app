<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>HOW MUCH ROOM DO WE ALLOW FOR ERROR?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Do we follow only the larger Techum?! (Rashi - automatically, this implies that the smaller Techum is permitted! Tosfos - surely, we should follow the smaller Techum in its place (e.g. southeast), and attribute the difference to swallowing and Mekadrin, and not to error!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer:</span> We follow even the larger Techum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Answer:</span> We follow even the smaller Techum [in its place].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a larger Techum was measured for one...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is just like the previous clause! (Why is it repeated?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that if two people measured and obtained different Techumim, we follow the larger one.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - (Abaye):</span> This is only if the difference is less than the excess of the diagonal over the side. (We can say that the shorter measurer was not proficient in measuring the diagonal.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - (Abaye):</span> This is only if [the second measurement is bigger and] we can attribute the excess to additions to the city [after the first measurement] and their diagonal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chachamim enacted Techumim to be lenient, but not to be stringent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> Chachamim enacted Techumim to be stringent, but not to be lenient.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> The Beraisa means that Chachamim did not enact Techumim to be more lenient than the Torah, rather, to be more stringent. It is only mid'Rabanan. (Therefore, they can be lenient about it.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN MAY WE BE ME'AREV A CITY?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If an individual's city became a public city, we may be Me'arev all of it. (Rashi - 600,000 people regularly pass through, but the streets are not wide enough to be Reshus ha'Rabim. R. Tam - Reshus ha'Rabim does not depend on 600,000 going through.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If a public city (even if it was not Reshus ha'Rabim) became an individual's city, we may be Me'arev it only if we leave outside the Eruv the size of the city 'Chadashah' of Yehudah, which has 50 residents;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Shimon says, one must leave over three Chatzeros, each with at least two houses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is a case of an individual's city that became public?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> Diskarta of the Reish Galusa is an example.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman):</span> Why is this the only case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Many people frequent the Reish Galusa [to get permission to judge]. Therefore, they will remind each other and will not come to permit a city of Rabim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> All of Yisrael gather on Shabbos morning [to hear the Chacham expound. It should always be permitted]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> The Mishnah applies to the city of [any individual, e.g.] Naszavai [that became public].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> If an individual's city became public, and Reshus ha'Rabim passes through it, how may we be Me'arev it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One puts a Lechi on each side or a Korah on each side, and then people may carry in the middle.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>One may not be Me'arev half of it. Rather, one must be Me'arev all of it, or each Mavoy by itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>If a public city is Reshus ha'Rabim, and it has only one opening, we may be Me'arev all of it.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">59b----------------------------------------59b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is our Tana, who permits to be Me'arev a Reshus ha'Rabim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> It is R. Yehudah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Yehudah said an even bigger Chidush. If one owns two houses on opposite sides of Reshus ha'Rabim, he puts a Lechi on each side or a Korah on each side and he may carry in the middle;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> We cannot be Me'arev Reshus ha'Rabim like this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not be Me'arev half of it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Papa):</span> One may not be Me'arev half of it lengthwise. (E.g. if Reshus ha'Rabim goes from north to south, the east half may not be Me'arev by itself. This is because Reshus ha'Rabim joins the Mavo'os.) One may be Me'arev half of it widthwise (e.g. the north half. See Perush Chai diagram, Perek 5 number 102, in the <a href=../chai/eruv-5chai102.jpg>English Charts</a> section.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is unlike R. Akiva, who says that [even] people who are permitted in their place (e.g. a Mavoy in the south) forbid elsewhere!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is even like R. Akiva. He discusses an inner Chatzer and an outer Chatzer, when the only opening of the inner Chatzer is through the outer. Here, each side can use its own opening!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Papa):</span> Don't say that one may not be Me'arev half lengthwise, but one may be Me'arev half widthwise. Rather, even widthwise is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is like R. Akiva, who says that people who are permitted in their place forbid elsewhere!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is even like Chachamim. They [say that people who are permitted] do not forbid regarding an inner Chatzer, for they can close the door [between the Chatzeros] and carry by themselves. [We force people to benefit others if they will not lose through this.] Here, nothing separates one part of Reshus ha'Rabim from the other!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One must be Me'arev all of it, or each Mavoy by itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One may not be Me'arev half of it, for it forbids the other half. The same should apply if one is Me'arev each Mavoy by itself!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, there is a Dakah (Rashi, according to Ritva - a small opening to outside the city; Tosfos - a low wall) at the end of each Mavoy. (This shows that it withdraws from the other Mavo'os):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> If a Chatzer made a Dakah in front of its opening [to the Mavoy], it does not forbid the Mavoy.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN IS IT FORBIDDEN TO BE ME'AREV THE ENTIRE CITY?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a public city is Reshus ha'Rabim...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Zeira was Me'arev the [public] city of R. Chiya's household. He did not leave a remnant.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Why did you do this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> Their elders told me that R. Chiya bar Asi was Me'arev all of it. I inferred that it was an individual's city that became a public city.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> The elders told me that there used to be a wasteheap blocking one opening. It was removed, so now there are two openings and one may not be Me'arev all of it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> I did not realize this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ami bar Ada):</span> If there is a ladder at one end [from the wall to outside the city] and it is open at the other end, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> Rav says that a ladder is like an opening. (One may not be Me'arev the entire city, for it has two openings.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> Rav Ada [bar Ahavah] said in the name of Rav that a ladder is like an opening, and like a wall:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is like a wall in this case. (It does not invalidate the wall);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is like an opening when it is between two Chatzeros. It permits the residents to be Me'arev together or separately.</p></div>
