<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Yehudah, who said that one lifts the barrel a Tefach off the ground - Beraisa):</span> To be Mishtatef, one brings a barrel of wine, oil, dates, figs, or other produce;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he owns it, he is Mezakeh (acquires) for everyone. If the Bnei Mavoy jointly own it, he must inform them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>[To be Mezakeh] he lifts it any amount off the ground.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'Any amount' means a Tefach. (Rashi - we do not require three Tefachim like for regular Kinyanim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One need not be Mezakeh for Shituf;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One must be Mezakeh;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One must be Mezakeh for Eruv Techumim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One need not be Mezakeh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand Shmuel. Our Mishnah teaches that one must be Mezakeh for Shituf, and the Mishnah of [how to make] Eruv Techumim does not mention Zikuy;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, what is Rav's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not Zikuy is needed:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> A case occurred in which R. Oshaya's daughter-in-law went to the bathhouse on Erev Shabbos and did not return before dark. Her mother-in-law was Me'arev for her (Tosfos - Eruv Chatzeros; Rashi - Eruv Techumim). R. Chiya disqualified the Eruv.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi:</span> Why are you stringent? My father taught that we are lenient about Eruvin whenever possible!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Was her mother-in-law Me'arev with her own food, and R. Chiya was Posel because she was not Mezakeh;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Or, did she Me'arev with the daughter's food, and R. Chiya was Posel because the daughter did not authorize it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yakov citing R. Yochanan):</span> It was the mother-in-law's food, and she did not Mezakeh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Zeira asked R. Yakov, the son of Bas Yakov to ask this of R. Yakov bar Idi. R. Yakov bar Idi gave the same answer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah is, Zikuy is required for Eruv Techumim, Eruv Chatzeros and Shituf.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> Does Eruv Tavshilim require Zikuy?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> Why does he ask? Didn't he hear Rav Nachman bar Ada say that Shmuel requires Zikuy?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Obviously, he did not hear it! Had he heard it, he would not ask!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> Regarding Eruv Techumim, even though Shmuel does not require Zikuy, Rav Nachman does! (Here also he could argue with Shmuel.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> There is different, for Rav argues with Shmuel. Rav Nachman adopts the stringencies of both of them;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Here, no one argues with Shmuel. Had Rav Nachman heard Shmuel's opinion, he would not have asked!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TAKING AN ERUV WITHOUT RESHUS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A Nochri (the overseer of the weapons of the city) in R. Zeira's area refused to rent his Reshus. His neighbors asked R. Zeira if they can rent from his wife.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> Reish Lakish taught that a wife can be Me'arev without her husband's Da'as (awareness. Eruv only applies to Yisraelim, but likewise, a Nochris can rent without her husband's Da'as.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The same question came in front of Rav Yehudah bar Oshaya and Rav Masnah; they did not know. Rav Yehudah was asked, and he answered in the name of Shmuel, like Reish Lakish.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a woman was Me'arev or Mishtatef without her husband's Da'as, it is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses when he does not forbid the Chatzer or Mavoy. (E.g. if a Chatzer is open to two Mavo'os, and it normally uses one of them, it does not forbid the other.) When he forbids, Reish Lakish and Shmuel permit [to rent from his wife without his Da'as].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> If we would not say so, Shmuel contradicts himself!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If a member of a Mavoy usually is Mishtatef (Me'iri - or usually uses the Mavoy) and now he was not Mishtatef, the Bnei Mavoy may enter his house and take Shituf [with his wife's consent], even against his will. (Me'iri - even if he previously protested, we assume that a man desires what his wife does. However, if he protests against her Shituf, it is invalid.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Tosfos) Inference:</span> One may take from his wife only if he usually is Mishtatef (for then he forbids). Otherwise, one may not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rosh) Inference:</span> His wife's consent helps only if he usually is Mishtatef (this applies when he does not forbid. When he forbids, one may take the Shituf without his consent even if he is not usually Mishtatef.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> We force one to make a Lechi or Korah for a Mavoy.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">80b----------------------------------------80b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1A (our text, Rashi) Rejection:</span> That is when there are no Mechitzos. (We force one to make a Lechi or Korah to help guard the Mavoy. Otherwise, we cannot force.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1B (Tosfos) Rejection:</span> That refers to Mechitzos. (A Lechi or Korah is a Mechitzah, whether he made it willingly or was coerced. Eruv works due to Kinyan or residence, so it requires consent.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Gra) Rejection:</span> Beis Din is different. (It can force, but Bnei Chatzer cannot.) (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Ashi):</span> An Asherah may be used for a Lechi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> An Asherah may be used for a Korah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>Reish Lakish permits a Korah. All the more so he would permit a Lechi;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>R. Chiya permits a Lechi, but he would not permit a Korah. Since an Asherah must be burned, it is as if it is ashes, so it does not have the required Shi'ur. (A Lechi must be 10 Tefachim tall, but the width and thickness do not matter. Chachamim gave more importance to a Korah, which must be a Tefach wide and strong enough to hold a half-brick. Something that must be burned is not so important.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ADDING TO AN ERUV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the food for the Eruv was Nisma'et (diminished below the Shi'ur), one must be Mezakeh more [before the next Shabbos]. He need not inform the others;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If new residents joined the Chatzer, one must add and be Mezakeh more food [of his own. Alternatively, he can be Me'arev with their food], and he must inform them (Rashi. R. Yehonason - if the Chatzer opens to only one Mavoy, even when new residents join, he need not inform them. It is a Zechus that they not forbid themselves and the Mavoy.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>When there are many people in the Mavoy, the Shi'ur is two meals (altogether). When there are few people in the Mavoy, the Shi'ur [for bread] is k'Grogeres (the size of a dried fig) for each person;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yosi says, this applies when one is Me'arev initially. Any remnant of an Eruv is valid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim required Eruvei Chatzeros [when there is Shituf Mavo'os] only to ensure that children [who do not see what happens in the Mavoy] will not forget the Mitzvah of Eruv.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He adds food of the same kind [that the Eruv consisted of].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, this is not only if the Eruv was diminished [below the Shi'ur]. Even if it was totally finished; he need not inform the others!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He adds a different food.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, even if the Eruv was only diminished he must inform the others!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the food was totally finished:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he adds more of the same, he need not inform the others;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If he adds a different food, he must inform the others. (We assume that the same applies even if it was diminished. The Beraisa said 'totally finished' to teach that even then, he can add the same food without informing them.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (and Defense of suggestion (d:1)):</span> Really, he adds food of the same kind. In the Mishnah, 'Nisma'et' really means Nismatet (it was finished).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Indeed, he adds a different food. The Beraisa requires informing the others only if the Eruv was finished.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If new residents joined the Chatzer, one must add and be Mezakeh [he must inform the others].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shizbi):</span> This teaches that Chachamim (our Tana, who is also the first Tana of the coming Mishnah) argue with R. Yehudah (i.e. R. Yehudah comes to argue, not to explain):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> This (one cannot be Me'arev for another without his Da'as) only applies to Eruv Techumim [for his gain in one direction (the extra distance he may walk) he loses in the opposite direction], but one may be Me'arev Eruvei Chatzeros for someone even without his Da'as.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It is obvious that they argue!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that [there is no argument;] our Mishnah discusses [only] a Chatzer between two Mavo'os. (If he is Me'arev with one, the other is forbidden to him), but [all agree that] if it opens only to one Mavoy, one may be Me'arev without their Da'as. He teaches that this is not so. (Our Mishnah discusses one Mavoy. Even so, Chachamim require their Da'as.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [When there are many people in the Mavoy,] the Shi'ur...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered many?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> Eighteen people is considered many.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Is 18 considered many, but more is not?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, 18 or more [is considered many].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yitzchak brei d'Rav Yehudah citing Rav Yehudah):</span> If we would divide two meals among the people and it would be less than k'Grogeres for each, this is many. Two meals suffice for all of them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Less people than this is few. A k'Grogeres is needed for each person.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p>He teaches, by the way, that two meals is (R. Yehonason's text - less than) 18 k'Grogeros. (According to our text, technically, 18 is called few (Rashash). Even so, in any case the Shi'ur for 18 equals two meals.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHAT MAY BE USED FOR AN ERUV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> One may be Me'arev or Mishtatef with anything except for water and salt;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehoshua says, an Eruv must be a loaf;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even if a partial loaf is the volume of a Se'ah (12 liters), one may not be Me'arev with it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Even if a loaf is the volume of an Isar (a small coin worth about eight Perutos), one may be Me'arev with it. (Rambam - one suffices for Eruvei Chatzeros. The Shi'urim in the previous Mishnah are for Shitufei Mavo'os. Rashi - one must be Me'arev with enough loaves to comprise a Shi'ur. Tosfos R. Peretz - it comprises the Shi'ur. It is very long, just its width is only k'Isar. Alternatively, it is worth only an Isar. R. Yehonason - it must be k'Grogeres, the amount that each person must give for the Eruv.)</p></div>
