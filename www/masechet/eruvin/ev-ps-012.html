<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> Lechayayim...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Eliezer require a Korah in addition to Lechayayim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> A case occurred in which R. Eliezer visited his Talmid R. Yosi ben Freida. He found him in a Mavoy with only one Lechi, and told him to make another.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> Must I seal it?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> Seal it! This is no problem!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel agree that nothing is needed to permit a Mavoy less than four Amos. They argue about a Mavoy between four and 10 Amos. Beis Shamai require a Lechi and Korah, Beis Hillel require a Lechi or Korah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of answer:</span> R. Yosi called this sealing off the Mavoy. Granted, Lechayayim and a Korah is like sealing it, but Lechayayim alone is not!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He meant 'must I seal it with Lechayayim?!' (<a href=ev-ps-appendix.htm#4>See note 4 in Appendix</a>.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel agree that nothing is needed to permit a Mavoy less than four Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In our Mishnah, R. Yishmael cited a Talmid to say that all agree that a Lechi or Korah permits a Mavoy less than four Amos [and R. Akiva agreed that something is needed to permit it]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel means that a Mavoy less than four does not need a Lechi and Korah like Beis Shamai, nor Lechayayim like R. Eliezer. Rather, a Lechi or Korah suffices, like Beis Hillel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the minimum [width] that needs something to permit it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Achli):</span> It is four Tefachim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>REMNANTS OF A CHATZER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> Chachamim agree with R. Eliezer about remnants of a [breached wall of a] Chatzer. (We require remnants on both sides);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows R. Eliezer regarding remnants of a Chatzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The Chachamim [whom Rav Sheshes says agree with R. Eliezer] are Rebbi. Rav Nachman says that the Halachah follows R. Eliezer. This implies that they argue [about a Chatzer]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana who argues with R. Eliezer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is Chachamim [who argue with Rebbi]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One remnant (Rashi - at one end of the breached wall; Rabbeinu Yehonason (on the Rif) - or in the middle) permits a Chatzer;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rebbi says, two remnants [at the ends] permit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Asi citing R. Yochanan):</span> A Chatzer requires two remnants.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> You yourself said in the name of R. Yochanan that remnants of a Chatzer must be four Tefachim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He means that four Tefachim are required on each side.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (A Mishnah teaches that if a small Chatzer was breached to a big Chatzer, the big Chatzer is permitted.) Rav Ada bar Avimi's Beraisa says that the small Chatzer is 10 [Amos wide], and the big Chatzer is 11. (It is only one Amah wider. There is no room for remnants of four Tefachim on each side!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> If there is only one remnant, it must be four Tefachim. If there are remnants on both sides, they can be any size;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Ada's Beraisa is like Rebbi [who requires two remnants]. He holds like R. Yosi [that each remnant must be three Tefachim. R. Yochanan holds like Chachamim, who require one remnant of four, or of any amount on both sides].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef citing Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> One remnant permits a Chatzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Shmuel told Rav Chananyah bar Shila not to permit unless the majority of the wall remains, or there are remnants on both sides!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I just know that a case occurred in a village of shepherds in which a strip from the sea entered a Chatzer (the wall was breached - see Perush Chai diagram, Perek 1 number 158, in the <a href=../chai/eruv-1chai158.jpg>English Charts</a> section), and Rav Yehudah required only one remnant.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> You cannot learn from there. Chachamim were lenient about [Mechitzos by] water!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Tavla):</span> Does a hanging Mechitzah permit carrying in a ruined house?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Chachamim gave this leniency only regarding water (86b; see Perush Chai diagram, Perek 1 number 160, in the <a href=../chai/eruv-1chai160.jpg>English Charts</a> section).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Abaye's question remains!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa and Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Shmuel says that one remnant permits if it is four Tefachim. If there are remnants on both sides, they can be any size.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Still, this does not explain why Shmuel told Rav Chananyah to require <i>the majority of the wall</i> or remnants on both sides. Four Tefachim suffice!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He refers to the majority of a seven Tefachim wall. Four Tefachim is the majority!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, it would suffice for anything more than three Tefachim to remain [for then the opening is less than four Tefachim]!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Achli):</span> The minimum [width that needs something to permit it] is four Tefachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav Achli discussed a Mavoy, but a Chatzer needs something to permit it even if it (the opening) is less than four Tefachim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Tana'im (13b) argue about Rav Achli's law.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a strip from the sea enters a Chatzer, one may not draw water from it on Shabbos unless there is a Mechitzah 10 Tefachim tall;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is if the wall was breached more than 10 [Amos]. If the gap is at most 10, nothing is required.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Beraisa forbids drawing water from it (Rashi; Tosfos - transferring between the Chatzer and the house). It does not forbid carrying in the Chatzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Chatzer is totally breached (i.e. more than 10) to an area to which one may not carry! (This should forbid the Chatzer itself.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">12b----------------------------------------12b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, there are Gedudei (Rashi - remnants of the breached wall that are 10 Tefachim tall, just they are covered by water; R. Tam - banks 10 Tefachim tall on each side of where the water enters).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHICH MAVO'OS ARE PERMITTED THROUGH A LECHI OR KORAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> (One may not carry in a Mavoy unless there is Shituf, i.e. food jointly owned by members of the Chatzeros.) If Shituf was not made in a Mavoy:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was Huchshar through a Lechi, one who throws to it [from Reshus ha'Rabim] is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it was Huchshar through a Korah, one who throws to it is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference (Rav Sheshes):</span> The exemption in the latter case is because Shituf was not made. However, if Shituf was made, in both cases one who throws to it is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Sheshes):</span> Surely, a loaf [for Shituf] cannot make it Reshus ha'Yachid or Reshus ha'Rabim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one threw [from Reshus ha'Rabim] to a Chatzer of Rabim (many houses open to it) or to a Mavoy that is not Mefulash, he is liable, whether or not an Eruv was placed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Yehudah):</span> If Shituf cannot be made in a Mavoy (Rashi - because it is Mefulash; Rashash - if so, it would need Tzuras ha'Pesach! R. Chananel - if a Mavoy Mefulash was Huchshar for Shituf through Tzuras ha'Pesach on the third side):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was Huchshar through a Lechi, one who throws to it is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it was Huchshar through a Korah, one who throws to it is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that a Lechi is considered a Mechitzah, but a Korah is only a Heker. This is like Rabah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> A Lechi is a Mechitzah. A Korah is only a Heker.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Both of these are only Hekerim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yakov bar Aba - Beraisa):</span> If one throws to a Mavoy:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it has a Lechi, he is liable. If not, he is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It means that if it needs only a Lechi (it already has three walls, which makes Reshus ha'Yachid mid'Oraisa), he is liable. If it needs more than a Lechi (it is Mefulash), he is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> R. Yehudah said an even bigger Chidush. If one owns two houses on opposite sides of Reshus ha'Rabim, he puts a Lechi on each side [of one house], or a Korah on each side, and he may carry in the middle. (This shows that Lechayayim <i>and</i> Koros are Mechitzos. Seemingly, it refutes not only Rava, rather, even Rav Yehudah and Rabah! R. Akiva Eiger - <i>they</i> can say that they hold like R. Yakov's Beraisa, which holds that a Lechi is a Mechitzah, but a Korah is not.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> We cannot be Me'arev Reshus ha'Rabim like this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah holds that two walls make a Reshus ha'Yachid mid'Oraisa. (The Lechayayim are needed only mid'Rabanan.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If the length of a Mavoy equals its width, a Lechi Mashehu (arbitrarily thin) does not permit it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chiya bar Ashi):</span> If the length of a Mavoy equals its width, a one-Tefach thick Korah does not permit it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for both of them - R. Zeira):</span> Since its length equals its width, it is like a Chatzer [in which one of the walls was breached]. A Lechi or Korah does not permit it. It requires a remnant [on one side that is four Tefachim wide. Some delete this from the text, for R. Zeira himself suggests that less should suffice.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> A Lechi should be considered a remnant Mashehu, and permit!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He forgot Rav Asi's teaching:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Asi citing R. Yochanan):</span> Remnants of a Chatzer must be four Tefachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chiya bar Ashi):</span> If the length of a Mavoy equals its width, a Korah a Tefach thick does not permit it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> We have a tradition that a Lechi or Korah permits a Mavoy only if its length exceeds its width, and houses and Chatzeros are open to the Mavoy. (Rashi - one house opens to each Chatzer. Rashi (74a) - two open to each Chatzer);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Lechi or Korah does not permit a Chatzer. Rather it requires a remnant four Tefachim wide, if it is square.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that a round Chatzer is permitted through a Lechi or Korah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. It means that if the length exceeds the width, it is a Mavoy, and a Lechi or Korah permits it. If not, it is a Chatzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much [must the length exceed the width to be considered a Mavoy]?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> It must be twice as long as its width.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav, citing R. Chiya):</span> The length can be Mashehu more than the width.</p></div>
