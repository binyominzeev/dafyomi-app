<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE ROPE USED TO MEASURE THE TECHUM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Dostai says in the name of R. Meir, I heard that if there is an incline that cannot be swallowed, [we do not measure with the 50 Amah rope along the slope. Rather,] we are Mekader. (We measure in a way, explained below, that reduces or cancels out the vertical component of the distance. it is as if we drilled through the hill to measure the horizontal distance).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> "Orech he'Chatzer Me'ah va'Amah v'Rochav Chamishim ba'Chamishim" teaches that we use a rope 50 Amos long.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need this to teach that we take [a square of 50 by] 50 Amos and surround it with [another square of] 50 Amos [cut into strips, to determine the largest area that may be Hukaf l'Dirah]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It could have said 'Chamishim Chamishim.' Rather, it says "Chamishim <i>ba</i>'Chamishim" to teach both of these.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We measure with a rope 50 Amos long, no more and no less.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not use a shorter rope, for then the Techum would be too long. (The people who measure can stretch it.) We do not use a longer rope, for then the Techum would be too short (the rope would sag in the middle, for it is hard to hold it taut).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> We use only a rope of Afsekima.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (R. Aba):</span> It is Nargila.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Nargila?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yakov):</span> It is a fibrous substance under the surface of a palm tree with only one branch or bark.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer #1 (R. Aba):</span> It is Nargila.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yakov):</span> It is a fibrous substance under the surface of a palm tree with only one bark.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehoshua):</span> The best tool for measuring is an iron chain (it cannot be stretched). We cannot disqualify (Me'iri; alternatively - we must use) ropes because it says "uv'Yado Chevel Midah."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It also says "uv'Yad ha'Ish Keneh ha'Midah"! (Also reeds should be good.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is for measuring gates.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> There are three kinds of ropes - Magag (a kind of reed), Netzarim (peeled willow) and flax:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Magag is used for Parah Adumah (since it is not Mekabel Tum'ah);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They tied the cow with a rope of Magag, and put it on top of the woodpile [on which it is burned].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Netzer is used for Sotah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Mitzri rope (i.e. Netzar - it alludes to the immorality she is suspected of) is tied above her breasts.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Flax is used for measuring.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN DO WE SWALLOW A CANYON?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If there is a canyon...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Since it says 'we resume measuring', this implies that if it cannot be swallowed (it is too wide), we go to the side [where it is narrower], swallow it there, and resume measuring. (See Perush Chai diagram, Perek 5 number 70, in the <a href=../chai/eruv-5chai070.jpg>English Charts</a> section.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Our Mishnah teaches like the following Beraisa;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If we encounter a canyon when measuring:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it can be swallowed by a rope 50 Amos long, we do so;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If not, we go to the side, swallow it there, and resume measuring.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the canyon is crooked, he is Makdir up and down the sides.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he reaches a wall, we do not pierce the wall. Rather, we estimate [its thickness] and continue.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah said that we swallow it and resume measuring!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses a canyon that one can traverse, e.g. it slopes 10 Tefachim amidst four Amos [of slope. Therefore, we are Mekader.] The Mishnah discusses a canyon too steep to be traversed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This is only if a plumb line (a weight hanging on a string, to determine what is vertical) does not descend [virtually] straight down (the edge is not so vertical). If it descends [virtually] straight down, we descend into the canyon and measure its width. (Since the edge is so steep, we ignore its horizontal component when measuring the Techum.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">58b----------------------------------------58b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How deep may a canyon be [and still we swallow it when it is at most 50 Amos wide]?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> It may be [up to] 2000 Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (and Answer #2 - Abaye - Beraisa):</span> If it is 100 deep and 50 wide, we swallow it. If not, we do not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yosef holds like Others:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Others):</span> Even if it is 2000 deep and 50 wide, we swallow it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> It may be even more than 2000 Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> This is not like Chachamim or Others!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They discuss when the plumb line does not descend [virtually] straight down. Rav Yosef discusses when it does.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How far from vertical must the plumb line be to say that it is not straight [and there is a limit to the depth until which we swallow]?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Avimi and Rami bar Yechezkeil's Beraisa):</span> It must be four Amos away.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TIMES THAT WE DO NOT SWALLOW A CANYON OR HILL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If we encounter a hill, we swallow it and resume measuring.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rava):</span> This is only if it slopes 10 Tefachim amidst four Amos. If it slopes 10 Tefachim amidst five Amos (it is not so steep), we measure it properly [with a rope 50 Amos long, without swallowing it];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rav Huna brei d'Rav Noson - (Rava):</span> This is only if it slopes 10 Tefachim amidst five Amos. If it slopes 10 Tefachim amidst four Amos, we estimate it and continue [from the other side].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ...As long as we do not leave the Techum (e.g. if the other side of the canyon is outside the Techum, we may not go there to gauge how far into the canyon the Techum extends. Rather, we gauge from the side. See Perush Chai diagram, Perek 5 number 73, in the <a href=../chai/eruv-5chai073.jpg>English Charts</a> section. Alternatively, when going to the side to swallow the canyon, we may not leave the Techum.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> This is a decree, lest people say that [since the measurers came to this place, surely] the Techum extends to here.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If we cannot swallow it...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> To be Mekader, the person below holds the rope near his heart, and the one above holds it near his feet.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We have a tradition that a rope four Amos long is used to be Mekader.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> We are not Mekader when measuring the Techum of an Ir Miklat or to bring Eglah Arufah, because they are mid'Oraisa.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>LENIENCIES OF MEASURING THE TECHUM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text) (Mishnah):</span> We measure only from a Mumcheh. (This will be explained);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi) (Mishnah):</span> Only a Mumcheh (expert) may measure. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If a Techum (e.g. to the east) was measured in two places (e.g. from the northeast and southeast corners), and one of them extends further [east] than the other, we follow the larger Techum;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If a larger Techum was measured for one and a smaller Techum for another, we follow the larger. (This will be explained.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Even a male or female slave is believed to say 'the Techum extends to this place', for Chachamim enacted Techumim to be lenient, and not to be stringent.</p></div>
