<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE TALMID OF REBBI AKIVA AND REBBI YISHMAEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yishmael):</span> A Talmid said... R. Akiva says, they argue in both cases (whether it is more or less than four Amos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Akiva does not argue with the first Tana!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about Rav Achli's law (the minimum width that needs something to permit it is four Tefachim). We cannot determine who holds like him and who argues.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> R. Yishmael did not say this. Rather, the Talmid said it, and the Halachah follows him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, he said 'R. Yishmael did not say this' because [he would not say it, i.e.] it is wrong. However, he also says that the Halachah follows the Talmid!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> R. Akiva said this just to test the Talmidim [if they would realize that it is wrong].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> R. Akiva said that he <i>favors</i> the opinion of the Talmid [but R. Yishmael argues].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Whenever R. Yishmael mentions 'a Talmid said in front of R. Akiva', he refers to R. Meir, who learned from both of them:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Meir):</span> When I learned from R. Yishmael, I used to put vitriol into the ink. (I was a scribe.) He did not comment;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>When I came to R. Akiva, he forbade me to do so. (This will be explained.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Yehudah cited R. Meir to say 'when I learned from R. Akiva, I used to put vitriol into the ink. He did not comment. When I came to R. Yishmael, I told him that I am a scribe';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> Be careful, for you do the work of Shamayim. If you omit a letter or add an extra letter, you destroy the world!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> I put vitriol into the ink!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> This is invalid. It says "v'Chosav...u'Mochah" (the curses to a Sotah are written on parchment and erased into water). The writing must be erasable! (Vitriol causes a stain to remain even after it is erased.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of this dialogue?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir said, not only am I proficient not to errantly omit or add extra letters. I am even concerned lest a fly rest on the top right protrusion of a 'Dalet' [and the ink will stick to it, and it will go away], making it a Reish. Therefore, I put vitriol into the ink!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Rav Yehudah's version argues with the Beraisa regarding whom R. Meir learned from first, and regarding which Chacham forbade him to use vitriol!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Partial answer:</span> We can say that first he went to R. Akiva to learn, but could not understand, so he went to R. Yishmael; and learned Mishnayos. (Before Rebbi codified and unified the text of the Mishnayos, each Tana had his own version.) Then, he returned to R. Akiva to learn sharp analysis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>The contradiction about which Tana forbade vitriol remains. (R. E. M. Horowitz - we do not say that Rav Yehudah is refuted, for if we assume that R. Meir [in Beraisa #2 below] holds like R. Akiva, Rav Yehudah and Beraisa #1 argue like R. Yakov and R. Yehudah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Yehudah citing R. Meir):</span> We may put vitriol into ink for anything, except for Parashas Sotah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>R. Yakov says in the name of R. Meir, [it is valid] except for Parashas Sotah in the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> R. Yehudah holds that one may erase the curses from a Sefer Torah. Therefore they must be erasable, so one may not use vitriol. R. Yakov argues about both of these laws. They argue like the following Tana'im:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A parchment written for a Sotah [that was not erased, e.g. she confessed after it was written] may not be used to test another Sotah. (It must be written for the sake of the woman it will test);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Achi bar Yoshiyah permits. (It need not be Lishmah. Therefore, one may erase from a Sefer Torah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Rav Papa):</span> The first Tana said only that a Parashah [written, and thereby] designated for Rachel cannot test Leah. If a Sefer Torah was not written for any particular woman, [perhaps] it is valid!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> R. Achi said only that a Parashah written for one Sotah can test another. A Sefer Torah is written [not to test Sotos, rather,] to learn from it. [Perhaps] it is invalid!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Achi argue with the following Mishnah?!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two couples in a city have identical names, and one man wrote a Get for his wife, and then decided not to divorce her, his namesake cannot divorce with the Get.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is different, for it says "v'Chosav Lah" - he must write the Get Lishmah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding Sotah it says "v'Asah Lah." It must be done, i.e. erased Lishmah. (It need not be written Lishmah.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SHARP CHACHAMIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Acha bar Chanina):</span> Hash-m knows that there was no one as sharp as R. Meir in his generation. The Halachah was not established like him, because he could bring convincing proofs to be Metaher what is really Tamei or vice-versa, and his colleagues could not discern if he was saying correctly. (Even though a Stam Mishnah is R. Meir, this is when there is no argument. When he argues with R. Yosi or R. Yehudah or perhaps even R. Shimon, the Halachah is unlike R. Meir - 46b.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Meir's real name was R. Nehurai. He is called R. Meir because he was Me'ir (illuminated) Chachamim's eyes in Halachah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The real name of [the Tana normally called] R. Nehurai was R. Nechemyah. Some say, it was R. Elazar ben Arach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He is called R. Nehurai because he was Manhir (enlightened) Chachamim's eyes in Halachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> I am sharper than my colleagues because I saw R. Meir from the back (Rashi - when I learned from him.) Had I seen him from the front, I would be even sharper - "v'Hayu Einecha Ro'os Es Morecha." (Chidushei Ge'onim - he understood the secondary teachings. Had he understood the primary teachings, he would have been even sharper. Rif (Beitzah 20a) brings a Yerushalmi that connotes that he saw R. Meir from the back on one occasion. It was not while learning.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Sumchus was a Talmid of R. Meir. He would give 48 reasons why every Tamei thing is Tamei, and 48 reasons why every Tahor thing is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There was a Talmid Chacham in Yavneh who could give 150 reasons why a Sheretz is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> I can show that it is Tahor a snake kills people, thereby increasing Tum'ah, yet it is Tahor. A Sheretz does not kill and increase Tum'ah, all the more so it is Tahor!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is not a Kal va'Chomer. Also thorns kill, but this is no reason to say that they are Tamei!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE ARGUMENT OF BEIS HILLEL AND BEIS SHAMAI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai argued for three years. Each said 'the Halachah follows us'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A Bas Kol announced 'the opinions of both of them are words of Hash-m. The Halachah follows Beis Hillel.' (Medrash brought in Tosfos R. Peretz - for every matter, Hash-m taught Moshe 49 reasons for Heter and 49 for Isur. He said that the Halachah will follow the majority of Chachamim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since both of them are words of Hash-m, why did Beis Hillel merit that the Halachah follows them?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They were pleasant and patient, and would teach Beis Shamai's opinion as well as their own. Further, they taught Beis Shamai's opinion before their own:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If Rosho v'Rubo (his head and the majority of its body) were in a Sukah, and his table was in the house, it (the Sukah) is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel are Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Beis Hillel:</span> A case occurred in which elders of Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel visited R. Yochanan ben ha'Choranis. Rosho v'Rubo were in the Sukah. His table was in the house, and they did not comment about this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Beis Shamai:</span> No! They told him, if you have always done so, you never fulfilled the Mitzvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This teaches that Hash-m raises one who lowers himself, and lowers one who raises himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>One who makes excessive efforts to attain wealth or grandeur will not attain it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One who does not receive now what he is entitled to, will receive it later.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai argued for two and a half years about whether or not it is better for man that he was created. (Beis Hillel said that it is.) In the end they voted, and decided that it would have better for him had he not been created. (This refers to regular people. It is advantageous for Tzadikim that they were created.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Now that he was created, he should check his deeds [lest he sinned, and must repent];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Some say that he should reckon his deeds (decide carefully before doing an action).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE WIDTH OF A KORAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Korah must be wide enough to hold half of a three-Tefachim brick;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>It suffices for the Korah to be a Tefach wide, to hold a half-brick. (This will be explained.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>It must be wide enough and strong enough to hold it;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it suffices to be wide enough to hold it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Korah is made of straw or reeds, we consider it to be of metal. If it is bent or round (cylindrical), we consider it to be straight and square (rectangular);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the circumference is three Tefachim, it is a Tefach wide. (This is not exact. <a href=ev-ps-appendix.htm#5>See note 5 in Appendix</a>.)</p></div>
