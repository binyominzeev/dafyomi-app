<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> We rely on the Chazakah that a Shali'ach fulfils his mission for mid'Rabanan laws, but not for mid'Oraisa laws.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> The Chazakah applies even for mid'Oraisa laws.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 Support (Rav Sheshes, for himself - Mishnah):</span> Once the Omer is offered, Chodosh (grain that took root after last Pesach) is permitted immediately;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>People far from the Mikdash [who do not know when it is offered] are permitted after midday.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Isur of Chodosh is mid'Oraisa, yet people far away are permitted after midday. This is due to the Chazakah that a Shali'ach fulfils his mission!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman):</span> The Seifa itself says that this is because Beis Din [of Kohanim] is not lazy. (Surely, they offered it by then. However, we do not rely on the Chazakah of a regular Shali'ach for mid'Oraisa laws.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 Support (Rav Nachman, for himself - Mishnah):</span> [They are permitted] because Beis Din is not lazy.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Beis Din is not lazy, but a regular Shali'ach could be lazy! (The Chazakah would not apply.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Sheshes):</span> Surely, Beis Din offered it by midday. For a regular Shali'ach, Chazakah teaches only that he fulfils his mission and offered it sometime [when it may be offered, i.e.] during the day [but not necessary before midday]. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rav Sheshes, for himself - Beraisa):</span> If Leah was obligated to bring birds due to a birth or Zivah (seeing blood for three consecutive days that cannot be attributed to Nidah; she is Mechusar Kipurim, i.e. forbidden to eat Kodshim until she brings birds), she may leave money [for the birds] in a special box [in the Mikdash], immerse, and eat Kodshim at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> She relies on the Chazakah that a Shali'ach fulfils his mission! (The Kohen bought birds and offered them.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman):</span> No, she relies on Rav Shemayah's teaching:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shemayah):</span> There is a Chazakah that the Beis Din of Kohanim does not leave [the Mikdash] until they finish [offering birds bought with] all the money in the box.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rav Sheshes, for himself - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'go pick figs from my tree [for yourself]', Shimon may eat from them casually [without tithing them], and [if he wants to eat Kavu'a, i.e. in a fixed manner] tithe them like Vadai (definite) Tevel. (Surely, Reuven did not tithe them. He does not know how much Shimon picked);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he said 'go fill this basket with figs from my tree', Shimon may eat casually [without tithing], and tithe them like Demai. (Perhaps Reuven tithed them. Shimon gives [or sells] Terumah and Terumas Ma'aser to a Kohen, but may keep the rest of the Ma'aseros for himself.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rebbi says, this is only if Reuven is an Am ha'Aretz (not trustworthy about Ma'aser). If he is a Chaver, Shimon may eat [even Kavu'a] without tithing. (Surely, Reuven took Terumah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, this is if he is an Am ha'Aretz. If Reuven is a Chaver, Shimon may not eat [Kavu'a] until tithing Vadai, for a Chaver is not suspected to be Torem Lo Min ha'Mukaf! (surely, Reuven did not tithe).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> My opinion is more reasonable - it is preferable for a Chaver to Torem Lo Min ha'Mukaf than to cause an Am ha'Aretz to eat Tevel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Rebbi and R. Shimon only argue about whether or not a Chaver is suspected to Torem Lo Min ha'Mukaf - but both would otherwise [normally] agree to the Chazakah that a Shali'ach fulfils his mission (Reuven is like a Shali'ach to separate for Shimon)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman):</span> That is an exception, due to Rav Chanina Chuza'ah's teaching:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chanina Chuza'ah):</span> There is a Chazakah that a Chaver does not allow Tevel to leave his Reshus [lest he transgress "v'Lifnei Iver Lo Siten Michshol", causing others to sin].</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WOULD A CHAVER BE TOREM LO MIN HA'MUKAF?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> This is if Reuven is an Am ha'Aretz...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In this case, what is Shimon's status?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he is an Am ha'Aretz, he will not obey [to tithe. Amei ha'Aretz trust each other. He is sure that Reuven tithed!]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that he is a Chaver.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Seifa - Rebbi):</span> My opinion is more reasonable. It is better for a Chaver to be Torem Lo Min ha'Mukaf than to cause an Am ha'Aretz to eat Tevel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We said that Shimon is a Chaver!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> In the Reisha, an Am ha'Aretz told a Chaver ['go fill this basket...']. In the Seifa, a Chaver told an Am ha'Aretz, and another Chaver (Levi) overheard;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">32b----------------------------------------32b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rebbi says, Levi may eat without tithing. Surely, the first Chaver took Terumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, he may not eat until tithing Vadai, because a Chaver is not suspected to be Torem Lo Min ha'Mukaf;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rebbi holds that it is better for a Chaver to be Torem Lo Min ha'Mukaf than to cause an Am ha'Aretz to eat Tevel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi holds that it is better for a Chaver to transgress a minor matter (to be Torem Lo Min ha'Mukaf) in order that an Am ha'Aretz not transgress a severe matter [through him, i.e. eating Tevel];</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Shimon holds that it is better [for the Chaver] that an Am ha'Aretz transgress a severe matter, and the Chaver not transgress anything.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>AN ERUV IN A TREE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an Eruv was in a tree above 10 Tefachim, it is invalid;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If it is below 10 Tefachim, it is valid;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If it is in a pit, even 100 Amos deep, it is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>(Gemara - R. Chiya bar Aba, R. Asi and Rava bar Noson) Question: Where is the tree? (All the questions and answers until (j) are from these three Chachamim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is in Reshus ha'Yachid, there is no distinction whether the Eruv is above or below 10, for Reshus ha'Yachid extends up to the sky!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is in Reshus ha'Rabim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Where did he intend his Shevisah to be?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he wanted to be Shoves above [on the tree], he and his Eruv are in the same place! (Even if it is above 10 it should be valid.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He wanted to be Shoves below [in Reshus ha'Rabim. Therefore, if his Eruv is above 10, i.e. in Reshus ha'Yachid, he cannot get to it during Bein ha'Shemashos].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> [Even if it is below 10, he may not take it, for if he does,] he uses the tree!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the tree is in Reshus ha'Rabim, and he intended to be Shoves below;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Isur to use a tree is mid'Rabanan. Our Mishnah is Rebbi, who permits Shevus during Bein ha'Shemashos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman (to the three Chachamim):</span> You are right. Also Shmuel explained like this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">The three Chachamim:</span> Do you give all these answers to explain the Mishnah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also they do!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, [they ask] did you establish this to be the explanation to pass on as a tradition?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Yes!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> The case is, the tree is in Reshus ha'Rabim. It is 10 tall and four wide, and he intended to be Shoves below. The Mishnah is Rebbi, who permits Shevus during Bein ha'Shemashos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This applies only to a tree outside the Ibur (the 70 Amos and a fraction surrounding a city). If it is within the Ibur, even if the Eruv is above 10, we consider the area to be full of dirt, and it is as if he intended to be Shoves above 10. (The Eruv is valid, even though he cannot take it during Bein ha'Shemashos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The same should apply even outside the Ibur!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rava holds that we 'give' four Amos to one who places an Eruv. (If it rolls less than four Amos outside the Techum, it is valid, for we consider that Mechitzos surround it.) The four Amos are considered Reshus ha'Yachid, which extends up to the sky!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yitzchak brei d'Rav Mesharshiya):</span> The case is, the tree leans [horizontally] outside of four Amos, and he intended to be Shoves at the trunk.</p></div>
