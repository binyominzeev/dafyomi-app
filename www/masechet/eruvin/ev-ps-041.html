Mazel Tov! </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>TIMES WE DO NOT COMPLETE A FAST (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava - Beraisa):</span> When Tishah b'Av or Erev Tishah b'Av falls on Shabbos, one may eat and drink [at the meal before the fast] as much as he wants. He may have a banquet as elaborate as Shlomo ha'Melech used to;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When Tishah b'Av falls on Erev Shabbos, he may eat k'Beitzah [of food before Shabbos], in order that he not enter Shabbos amidst affliction.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Once, Tishah b'Av fell on Erev Shabbos; they brought a roasted egg for R. Akiva. He ate it without salt;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He was not hungry, he just wanted to show the Halachah to Talmidim. (R. Chananel - we have a tradition that doctors told R. Akiva to eat an egg because he was dangerously sick; R. Yehudah was unaware of this.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yosi says, he must complete the fast.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> Don't you agree that when Tishah b'Av falls on Motza'ei Shabbos, one must stop eating [on Shabbos] while it is still day?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> We agree.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> Just like one may end Shabbos amidst [the beginning of] a fast, one may enter Shabbos amidst affliction!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> One may end Shabbos amidst a fast, for he ate and drank the entire day [he is satiated]. One may not enter amidst affliction of having fasted the entire day!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Yosi!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Gamliel):</span> [When rain is late to come in Eretz Yisrael in winter, we decree sets of three or seven fasts on Mondays and Thursdays.] We do not decree a fast on the Tzibur [starting] on Rosh Chodesh, Chanukah or Purim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If we started beforehand, we do not interrupt [the series of fasts, if at least one or three fasts already passed - Ta'anis 18b. Rashi says so if 20 or 30 days have passed. Perhaps he holds like Ritva (Ta'anis 15b), that Beis Din does not intentionally decree fasts that will include these days. It is reasonable that it did not cross their minds that one of these days will occur 20 or 30 days later.]</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> Even though R. Gamliel says that we do not interrupt, he agrees that we do not complete the fast.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The same applies when Tishah b'Av falls on Erev Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> After R. Gamliel died, R. Yehoshua came to overturn his words [and say that we complete the fast].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Nuri:</span> The body must follow the head. (R. Gamliel was the Nasi);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>As long as R. Gamliel was alive, the Halachah followed him. Will we now annul his words?! No. The Halachah was fixed like him!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>No one argued with R. Yochanan ben Nuri.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The generation of R. Gamliel followed R. Gamliel, but the generation of R. Yosi follows R. Yosi!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Gamliel's generation did not follow him!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer b'Ribi Tzadok):</span> Once, Tishah b'Av fell on Shabbos, and the fast was postponed to the 10th. My family did not complete the fast, for we descend from Sin'av ben Binyamin (a family that used to bring wood for the Mizbe'ach on the 10th of Av.) It is Yom Tov for us.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> They did not complete the fast because the fast itself was [their] Yom Tov, but when Tishah b'Av is not on Shabbos, and the fast is on Erev Yom Tov (the ninth), they complete the fast!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> A Yom Tov mid'Rabanan is different. Since one may fast part of the day (e.g. when Tishah b'Av is postponed to the 10th), we finish a fast before it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since one may not fast on part of Shabbos, we do not finish a fast before it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I never heard this teaching [of Ula].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> You taught it to us regarding the Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We not decree a fast on the Tzibur [starting] on Rosh Chodesh... [R. Meir says, R. Gamliel agrees that we do not complete a fast that falls on one of these days].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This is the opinion of R. Meir in the name of R. Gamliel, but Chachamim say that one fasts and completes the fast.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He refers to all of the days that R. Meir discusses [including Erev Shabbos]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, he refers only to [Rosh Chodesh,] Chanukah and Purim [which R. Gamliel himself discussed].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> He cannot refer to all of them, for Rav Yehudah could not answer Rabah's question [about Erev Shabbos, at the beginning of this discussion]!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">41b----------------------------------------41b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Mar Zutra said in the name of Rav Huna that the Halachah is that one completes the fast, even though Rav Huna did not answer Rabah's question!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We must say that Rav Huna did not know at first, and later he heard the Halachah. The same applies to Rav Yehudah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra citing Rav Huna):</span> The Halachah is, one completes the fast.</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK #4 MI SHE'HOTZI'UHU</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SOMEONE WHO WAS TAKEN OUTSIDE OF HIS TECHUM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was taken outside his Techum by Nochrim or a Ru'ach Ra'ah (evil spirit), he has only four Amos [in the place to which he was taken] to walk;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If they returned him to his Techum, it is as if he never left.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Gamliel and R. Elazar ben Azaryah say, if they brought him to another city and put him in a Dir or Sahar (a field where animals graze), all of it is permitted to him;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yehoshua and R. Akiva say, he has only four Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Once, these Chachamim were on a boat that left the Techum on Shabbos. R. Gamliel and R. Elazar ben Azaryah traversed the entire boat. R. Yehoshua and R. Akiva did not leave their four Amos, to be stringent on themselves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Once, the boat did not enter the port until Shabbos. They asked R. Gamliel if they may get off.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> You are permitted. I saw that we were within the Techum before dark.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HARSH ADVERSITIES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Three things force a person to act against his will and against Hash-m's will - Nochrim, Ru'ach Ra'ah, and the hardships of poverty.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need to know this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One should pray that he [and everyone else] be spared from them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Three categories of people do not see [any punishment in] Gehinom - those who bear the hardships of poverty, suffer stomach pains, or have creditors (Rashi; Tosfos - bear the yoke of the Nochri kingdom).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Some say, also one who has an evil wife.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the first opinion omit this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that it is a Mitzvah to divorce her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The latter opinion includes it, for sometimes he cannot divorce her because her Kesuvah is large, or he has children from her [and cannot raise them himself].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need to know that these save from Gehinom?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He should bear them with love.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>There are three that die even when they [have much strength and can] talk -- one who dies from stomach pains, giving birth, and Hadrikon (jaundice).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need to know this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One should prepare shrouds for them.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>ONE WHO LEFT HIS TECHUM WILLINGLY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If one left the Techum willingly, he has only four Amos (Rambam - even if he is now in a city. Tosfos (29a) - a city is considered like four Amos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious! If he was taken outside against his will, he has only four Amos, so all the more so if he left willingly!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if he returned to his Techum willingly, he has only four Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We already learn this from our Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If they returned him to his Techum, it is as if he never left.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he returned willingly, even though he was taken out against his will, he has only four Amos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if he left willingly and Nochrim returned him [against his will], he has only four Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also this we learn from our Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Nochrim took him out and returned him, it is as if he never left.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is not the law when he left willingly!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the second clause is independent of the first, i.e.:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Nochrim took him out, and [he stayed there or] returned willingly, he has only four Amos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If they returned him against his will, whether or not he left willingly, it is as if he never left.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rav Nachman teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If [one has only four Amos] and he needs to move his bowels (Rosh; R. Chananel - or to urinate), may he leave the Techum for this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Kevod ha'Briyos (the honor of people) is so important that it overrides a Lav in the Torah ("Lo Sasur", the basis of all mid'Rabanan laws, including Techumim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Neharda'a):</span> If he is clever, he will enter the Techum [to eliminate. Since this is permitted, it is as if Nochrim returned him against his will.] Once he is there, he is permitted. (Rosh - he may head for the Techum, but if he finds a proper place beforehand, he may not go further.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If produce left the Techum and returned, even if it was b'Mezid, it did not lose its Techum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The produce did not choose to leave. (Losing one's Techum is a fine that applies only to one who left b'Mezid.)</p></div>
