<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Both of them learn from the same verse (Tosfos. Rashi - he rejects the previous suggestion. Really, all are Mechayev for bringing in a Sheretz):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Va'Yavo'u ha'Kohanim li'Fnimah Veis Hash-m Letaher va'Yotzi'u Es Kol ha'Tum'ah Asher Matz'u b'Heichal Hash-m la'Chatzer Beis Hash-m va'Ykablu ha'Leviyim Lehotzi l'Nachal Kidron" - Ben Nanas holds that since the Kohanim take it out of the Heichal, but not out of the entire Azarah, this shows that one need not remove it from the entire Azarah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Akiva holds that Kohanim remove it as far as necessary, to the place where Leviyim can come and remove it, to minimize Tum'as Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Anyone may enter the Heichal to build or fix it, or to remove Tum'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>L'Chatchilah, we use Kohanim. If Kohanim are not available, we use Leviyim. If Leviyim are not available, we use Yisraelim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>In any case we use only people who are Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Rav Kahana favors Kohanim. (He teaches a Beraisa that gives Tamei Kohanim priority over Tahor Yisraelim):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana - Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Ach El ha'Paroches Lo Yavo" forbids a Kohen with a blemish to go between the Ulam and the Mizbe'ach to make [gold] foil [to cover the inside of the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ach" limits. (He may not enter to offer Korbanos, but he may enter for other things.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>L'Chatchilah, we use Temimim (unblemished Kohanim). If they are not available, we use Ba'alei Mumim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>L'Chatchilah, we use Tehorim. If they are not available, we use Temei'im;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Both of these refer to Kohanim. [Whenever possible,] we do not use Yisraelim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which is preferable, to use a Tamei or a Ba'al Mum?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chiya bar Ashi):</span> A Tamei enters, because he is Kosher for Avodas Tzibur;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Elazar):</span> A Ba'al Mum enters, for he may eat Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> [Chachamim permitted to you [only] what [really] is permitted].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which law does he discuss?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah (52b)):</span> If one was traveling and he was outside the Techum when it became dark, even if he was only one Amah outside he may not enter;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says, even if he was 15 Amos outside he may enter, for those who measure do not put the Techum marker at the full 2000 Amos, due to people who err [and walk past it. Alternatively, measurers err, and grasp the rope in their hands. This causes their measure to be 15 Amos too short.]</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The first Tana forbids [one who left] to re-enter. R. Shimon permits him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> ...Because they waived only Shevus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which law does he discuss?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first Tana taught ((102b) that if a string of a Levi's harp broke,) he may tie it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>[In a Beraisa (103a)] R. Shimon permits only a bow. He explains that this is because it is only Shevus (R. Chananel. Tosfos - it is permitted even mid'Rabanan.) It cannot lead to a Chiyuv Chatas;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>One may not tie a knot, for this could lead to a Chiyuv Chatas [if he would tie a permanent knot outside the Mikdash].</p></div>
