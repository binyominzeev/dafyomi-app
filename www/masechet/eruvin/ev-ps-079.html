<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHEN IS DIRT BATEL?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it is full of dirt... [they may be Me'arev together but not separately].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Stam (without specifying, we do not assume that) dirt is Batel (will be left there permanently)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah in Ohalos):</span> If [Tum'as Mes was in a house, and] it was full of straw or pebbles (these are like dirt regarding Bitul) and one was Mevatel them (decided to leave them there permanently), they are Batel. (When gauging whether or not there is a gap of a cubic Tefach above the Tum'ah for Tum'as Ohel, we do not include their space);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> They are Batel only because he explicitly was Mevatel them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> A Stam Mishnah in Ohalos is assumed to be R. Yosi. (He argues with our Tana).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yosi holds that dirt and pebbles are Batel without specifying!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> If straw [in a house] will not be removed (we know that it is not needed, but he did not explicitly Mevatel it), it is like Stam dirt (about which we have no knowledge), it is Batel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If dirt will be removed [we know that it is needed], it is like Stam straw, it is not Batel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Asi):</span> A Stam Mishnah in Eruvin is assumed to be R. Yosi. (He argues with the Mishnah in Ohalos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> You cannot ask from Tum'ah to Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Bitul for Tum'ah must be permanent. Regarding Shabbos, even a wallet is Batel (for one may not move it on Shabbos)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ashi):</span> You cannot ask from [Bitul in] a house to a ditch!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>People normally [permanently] fill in a ditch. They do not normally fill up a house!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one put a plank four wide [across the ditch...]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The plank must be four wide only if the length of the plank goes along the width of the ditch. If it goes along the length (part rests on the ground, and part is supported on pegs over the ditch), if it is any width it can be Mema'et [the width of the ditch from four. Since one can step on the plank, it is now easy to step to the other Chatzer, for less than four Tefachim remain].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The same applies to two balconies opposite each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A plank four wide joins them only if they are opposite each other. If not, or if one of them is higher than the other, it does not join them (Rashi. Tosfos - they are like one when they are less than four apart only if they are opposite each other. If not, or if one of them is higher than the other, they may not be Me'arev together, for it is hard to walk from one to the other);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>This is only if they are three Tefachim apart. If not, they are like one.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A MECHITZAH OF STRAW</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a haystack [along the entire border] between two Chatzeros is 10 tall, they may be Me'arev separately, but not together;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Members of both Chatzeros may feed their animals from the stack.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If the stack became less than 10 Tefachim [tall along the entire border, or for more than 10 Amos], they may be Me'arev together, but not separately.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Huna):</span> One may feed his animal from the stack, but he may not put into his Kli and feed it. (The hay is Muktzeh for the Mechitzah. Alternatively, we are concerned lest he inadvertently diminish the wall, which would invalidate the Eruvin, and people will still carry.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He may bring his animal there to eat. (We are not concerned lest he put into his Kli.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna citing R. Chanina):</span> On Shabbos, one may bring his animal to eat from attached grass (we are not concerned lest he detach, for this is forbidden mid'Oraisa), but not from Muktzeh [lest he take some to feed it. This is forbidden only mid'Rabanan, so people are not so careful about it. Also regarding the haystack, we should be concerned lest he transgress a mid'Rabanan law!]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Indeed, he may not <i>bring</i> his animal there.) He may only stand in front of it [giving it no other place to go], and it goes by itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> He may not put into his Kli and feed it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a house between two Chatzeros (a house from each Chatzer opens to it) was filled with straw, the Chatzeros may be Me'arev separately but not together;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Members of both Chatzeros may put straw into their Kelim and feed their animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the straw became less than 10 Tefachim, both are forbidden [to carry in the Chatzeros].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>To permit [the other Chatzer], one locks [the door of] his house [that opens to the middle house] and is Mevatel his Reshus [to the other Chatzer]. He is forbidden, and the other [Chatzer] is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The same applies to a pile of straw, if different parts of it are in the Techumim of different cities.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> They put straw into their Kelim and feed their animals!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since a house has a ceiling, people will notice if the straw gets too low. They will not notice if a stack outdoors gets below 10. (Even though one may not take the straw because it is Muktzeh, this only applies below 10. Above 10 is not needed for the Mechitzah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the straw became less than 10 Tefachim, both are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> When the straw is at least 10, they are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that a Mechitzah [in a house] is valid even if it does not reach to the ceiling! (This is unlike the Halachah (72b).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The case is, the ceiling is less than 13 tall, and the stack is 10. (It 'reaches' the ceiling, through Lavud);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> We can even say that the ceiling is 10 and the stack is slightly more than seven. Any gap less than three is Lavud.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">79b----------------------------------------79b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Abaye, we understand why the Beraisa says that the straw must be 10. How does Rav Huna explain this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that the straw must be considered like 10 (in reality, or through Lavud).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A <i>MECHITZAH</i> OF STRAW (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Both are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If new residents come on Shabbos (like the people of the other Chatzer, who had no connection to this Chatzer until the straw was diminished), they forbid!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the Beraisa forbids only when it became diminished before Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> To permit, one may lock his house and be Mevatel his Reshus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must he do both of these?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Indeed, it suffices to lock <i>or</i> be Mevatel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> [Even though one suffices to permit the others,] since he is used to carrying, both of these are required [lest he take things out. Rashi - the Tana always requires one who is Mevatel to also lock his house. Tosfos - he requires this only the first time. Afterwards, he is used to not carrying. Me'iri - the Beraisa teaches that <i>even</i> if he is Mevatel, he must lock it.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He is forbidden, and the other is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious! (The Mevatel is always forbidden.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the one permitted was later Mevatel his Reshus back to the other. The Tana teaches that Bitul after Bitul does not work.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The same applies to a pile of straw, if different parts of it are in the Techumim of different cities. (People of each city may take from their side. We are not concerned lest they take from the other side.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a Chidush according to R. Akiva, who says that Techumim are forbidden mid'Oraisa;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that we decree to forbid [feeding animals], lest one take from the other Techum. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>TEACHINGS OF THE ELDERS OF PUMBEDISA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may make Shituf in a Mavoy [on behalf of everyone] by taking a barrel (e.g. of wine) and saying that it is for everyone in the Mavoy. He may ask [even] any of the following to be Mezakeh (acquire) on behalf of them - his mature son or daughter, his Yisrael male or female slave, or his wife;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He cannot be Mezakeh through his small son or daughter, or his Kena'ani male or female slave, because they can acquire only for him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> One must lift the barrel for Shituf a Tefach off the ground.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The elders of Pumbedisa (Rav Yehudah and his academy) taught this and another teaching.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(The other teaching):</span> One who makes Kidush must drink [at least] Malei Lugmav (the amount that one can hold in his mouth when one cheek sticks out). If he did not, he did not fulfil his obligation.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chaviva):</span> They taught also the following:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> We may make a bonfire for a Yoledes on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> This is permitted for a Yoledes, but not for other sick people. It is permitted only in winter, but not in summer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Chiya bar Avin taught that if someone let blood and got chilled, we may make a bonfire for him, even in summer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> They taught also the following:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What tree is [assumed to be] an Asheirah, even though we do not see that it is worshipped?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> If the priests [of idolatry] guard it and do not eat its fruits, it is an Asheirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> [Even] if they say 'the dates are for Bei Nitzrefei (an idolatry)', the tree is forbidden, for they make beer from the dates and drink it on their festival.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(The elders of Pumbedisa):</span> The Halachah follows Shmuel.</p></div>
