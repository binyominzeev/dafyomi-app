<p class=newsubject><span class=numt>1)</span> THE GATES OF THE <i>AZARAH</i></p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(a)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah 1):</span> Kohanim guard in three places in the Beis ha'Mikdash -- in Beis Avtinas, Beis ha'Nitzotz, and Beis ha'Moked.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(b)</span>	Leviyim guard in 21 places -- the five gates of Har ha'Bayis, the four inside corners, five gates of the Azarah, the four outside corners, Lishkas ha'Korban, Lishkas ha'Paroches, and in back of the Kodesh ha'Kodashim.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(c)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah 2):</span> The one appointed over Har ha'Bayis would investigate everyone guarding. Torches went in front of him. If someone did not greet him, this shows that he was sleeping. The appointee would hit him with his stick, and was allowed to burn his clothes.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	People who would hear someone screaming could infer that a Levi was being beaten for sleeping.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(d)</span>	R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, once, my uncle slept, and they burned his clothes.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(e)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah 3):</span> There were five gates of Har ha'Bayis:</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	Two Sha'arei Chuldah were in the south, they were for entry and exit;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span>	(Sha'ar) Kifunus was in the west, it was for entry and exit;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>3.</span>	Tadi was in the north, it was not used at all. (Gra - Ba'alei Keri would leave through it. To spare them shame. no one used it for anything else.)</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>4.</span>	Shushan ha'Birah was depicted on Sha'ar Mizrachi (the eastern gate). The Kohen Gadol and all involved with Parah Adumah would leave through it when going to Har ha'Mishchah (Mount of Olives) to burn the Parah. (The Halachah is that even a regular Kohen may burn the Parah Adumah. Perhaps the Mishnah agrees with this, but it discusses the Kohen Gadol because he usually burned it.)</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(f)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah 4):</span> There are seven gates to the Azarah -- three in the north, three in the south, and one in the east;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	In the south were Sha'ar ha'Delek, Sha'ar ha'Korban and Sha'ar ha'Mayim;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span>	In the east was Sha'ar Nikanor. There was a Lishkah on each side (right and left), one of Pinchas ha'Malbish (who supervised the Bigdei Kehunah), and one where Chavitim were made.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(g)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah 5):</span> Sha'ar ha'Nitzotz was in the north. It was like an Achsadra (it was open on one side). It was built on top (of walls protruding from the wall of the Azarah);</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	Kohanim guarded from above, and Leviyim guarded below. It had an opening to Chol (non-sanctified area).</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span>	Also in the north were Beis ha'Moked and Sha'ar ha'Korban. (Bartenura - Kodshei Kodashim, which are slaughtered in the north, were brought through it. Rosh - the gate in the south of this name was used for Temidim. Alternatively, it was known that Avraham brought Yitzchak through that place to the Akeidah.)</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(h)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah 6):</span> There were four chambers in Beis ha'Moked, like small rooms open to a palace. Two were Kodesh (they were in the Azarah), and two were Chol.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(i)</span>	Beams came out of the wall. They ended at the dividing line between Kodesh and Chol.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(j)</span>	Question: What were the Lishkos used for?</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(k)</span>	Answer: The southwest Lishkah was for Korbanos (to check animals for Mumim. Alternatively, lambs already checked for Temidim were kept there. The Mishnah in Tamid (30a) says that Lishkas ha'Tela'im was in the northwest corner! The Gemara (Yoma 15b) answers that it was a long chamber along the middle of the west side, to someone in the northwest it appeared to be in the southwest, and vice-versa.)</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	The Lechem ha'Panim was made in the southeast Lishkah;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span>	The northeast Lishkah was where Bnei Chashmonai hid stones of the Mizbe'ach that the kings of Yavan used for idolatry; (Rosh - the Mishnah in Tamid calls this Lishkas ha'Chosamos, for that was its purpose.)</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>3.</span>	A Kohen who had an emission descended through the northwest Lishkah to immerse.</p>
<p class=bbbline>34b----------------------------------------34b</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(l)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah 7):</span> Beis ha'Moked had two gates. One was open to the Cheil, and one was open to the Azarah;</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(m)</span>	R. Yehudah says, there was a small opening in the latter. Through it they would wash the Azarah. (Alternatively, through it they entered to check if all the Kelim were there, or if any Shomrim were sleeping.)</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(n)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah 8):</span> Beis ha'Moked was a dome. It was a big house, with stone ledges jutting out all around. The elders of the Beis Av would sleep there with the keys to the Azarah in their hands;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	Also Pirchei (young) Kohanim slept there (Mefaresh, Tamid 25b. Bartenura - they guarded there. Tiferes Yisrael - they took turns guarding and sleeping);</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span>	They sleep on the floor. (It is improper to bring beds there.) Each puts his garment (alternatively - pillow and/or blanket) on the ground.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(o)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah 9):</span> There was a place there, a square Amah, covered by a marble tile with a ring on it, and keys hanging on a chain. (Me'iri - the keys hung from the ring, which was under the tile);</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(p)</span>	When it was time to lock the gates, they lifted the tile with the ring and took the keys from the chain. (Rosh - all of Har ha'Bayis was tiled. All the tiles were attached, except for this one.)</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	A Kohen locked from the inside, and a Levi slept outside. Afterwards, he returned the keys to the chain and returned the tile, and covered it with his garment and slept.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(q)</span>	If one of the Kohanim had an emission, he would go to the Mikveh through tunnels under the Birah (Mikdash). There were lamps illuminating the tunnels;</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(r)</span>	R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, the tunnels were under the Cheil. He would leave through Sha'ar Tadi. (Gra - all agree that he would leave through Sha'ar Tadi. Most Mefarshim - the first Tana argues.)</p>
<p class=perekline>PEREK HAR HA'BAYIS</p>
<p class=newsubject><span class=numt>2)</span> WALKING AROUND <i>HAR HA'BAYIS</i></p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(a)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah 1):</span> Har ha'Bayis was 500 Amos by 500 Amos;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span><span class=desl2>	Version #1 (Bartenura):</span> The largest (empty) area was south (of the Mikdash);</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span><span class=desl2>	Version #2 (Rosh):</span> The most (built) portion was the south; (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>3.</span>	The next greatest was in the east, then in the north, and the least was in the west.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>4.</span>	The greatest area was used the most.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(b)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah 2):</span> Anyone who enters Har ha'Bayis enters from the right, turns to his left and goes around (counter-clockwise);</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(c)</span>	The only exception is one who suffered a mishap. He turns to his right and goes around (clockwise). Anyone who sees him asks about this;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	If he answers that he is an Avel, the other blesses him "the One who dwells in this House should console you";</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span>	R. Meir says if he answers that he was excommunicated, the other person says "the One who dwells in this House should make them (those who excommunicated you) want to draw you close."</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>3.</span><span class=desl2>	R. Yosi:</span> This sounds like they were wrong to excommunicate him!</p>
<p class=thirdindent><span class=numl3>i.</span>	Rather, he says "the One who dwells in this House should put in your heart to heed their words, and they will draw you close."</p>
