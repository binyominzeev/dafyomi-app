<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ELABORATION OF <i>MISHNAH'S</i> STATEMENT ON 27a, 4:c</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>There is a dispute as to which women this rule (not placing their bier in the street) applies to.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Neharda'ei):</span> It applies only to women who died in childbirth.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> It applies to all women. He backs up his opinion with a Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Gemara then discusses the deaths of Aharon and Miriam.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DIFFERENT KINDS OF DEATH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A Beraisa discusses different levels of suddenness of death.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Beraisa also discusses ages of people who die:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Death at fifty is what Kares is.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Death at fifty-two is like Shmuel's death.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Death at sixty is what Misah b'Yidei Shamayim is.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Death at seventy is considered reaching old age.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Death at eighty is considered having reached the stage of unusually long life ("strength").</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Not only is death at fifty Kares, but so is death from fifty to sixty. The Beraisa did not say this explicitly out of respect to Shmuel, who died at fifty-two.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>At this point the Gemara tells several stories about various rabbis and their encounters with the angel of death.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MISHNAH - MOURNING GESTURES ON SEMI-HOLIDAYS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Women may do Me'aneh on Chol ha'Mo'ed, but should not do Metape'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yishmael disagrees, and allows Metape'ach for the women standing next to the bier.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>On Rosh Chodesh, Chanukah and Purim women may do Metape'ach, but not Mekonen. After the burial, the Me'aneh and Metape'ach actions must stop.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Definitions:</span> Me'aneh is when all the women recite a dirge together. Mekonen is when one leads and the others respond.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Statement:</span> In the future there will be no more death.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>ABOUT DIRGES AND EULOGIES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Gemara brings several samples of dirges that women used to say about different types of people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">A Beraisa talks about reciprocity in mourning:</span> The more one mourns and eulogizes (etc.) others, the more these will be done for him when the time comes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A Beraisa tells the story of the death of R. Yishmael's sons and the consolations offered by his four great teachers.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>MORE ETIQUETTE FOR MOURNERS AND COMFORTERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The consolers should not say anything until the mourner begins the conversation.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> The mourner should sit at the head of the table. This is derived from a Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chama bar Chanina):</span> A groom should also sit at the head of the table. This is derived from a Pasuk.</p></div>
