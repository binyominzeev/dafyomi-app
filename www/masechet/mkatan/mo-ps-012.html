<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>EMPLOYING NON-JEWISH WORKERS ON SHABBOS AND YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Non-Jewish contractors (hired before Shabbos) may do work for a Jew on Shabbos and Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> This is only true if the work they are doing is out of walking distance (Techum Shabbos) of any city, so that no one will see what they are doing and suspect that they were hired on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Mesharshia):</span> On Chol ha'Mo'ed even this is forbidden, because people can travel to the place even when it is out of the Techum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Story:</span> Mar Zutra Breih d'Rav Nachman once had a mansion built (out of the Techum) by non-Jewish contractors who worked on Shabbos and Yom Tov. Yet several rabbis (some say even Mar Zutra himself) refused to walk into the house.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the rules given above (2:a-c) Mar Zutra did nothing wrong. Why did the rabbis boycott the house?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> An important, prominent man must follow a more stringent standard (see above, 11b, 2:d:2).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Mar Zutra himself had supplied them with straw (for bricks) on Shabbos and Yom Tov, and this was forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WORK THAT IS NOT MELACHAH ON CHOL HA'MO'ED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Chama allowed the Reish Galusa's table-fixers to do their work (which did not involve actual Melachah - Rosh) on Chol ha'Mo'ed because they did not receive a salary but only worked for their food. (But working for a salary would be forbidden, even if it does not involve Melachah.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>BERAISOS - GIVING WORK TO A NON-JEW ON CHOL HA'MO'ED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One may give work to a non-Jew (e.g., cleaners, shoemaker, repairman) on Chol ha'Mo'ed to do after Chol ha'Mo'ed, but not to do on Chol ha'Mo'ed</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Amirah l'Acum (instructing a non-Jew to do a Melachah) is forbidden on Chol ha'Mo'ed (for those Melachos which are forbidden to Jews).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>When giving the work to the non-Jew (as in 3:a) one must not measure, weigh, etc. the objects involved in the normal, week-day manner.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>BERAISOS ABOUT WORKING WITH ANIMALS ON CHOL HA'MO'ED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One may not mate his animals on Chol ha'Mo'ed (It is also forbidden to use a Bechor animal or Pesulei ha'Mukdashin animal for breeding.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah permits mating a she-ass in heat, to prevent her from becoming ill. For other animals in heat he should just put them into the barn where there are males and let nature take its course.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One may not lead his animals into his field with the intention of having them fertilize the land on Shabbos and Yom Tov and Chol ha'Mo'ed If they went into the field themselves he may leave them there, but not assist them or hire a non-Jew oversee them. If one already has a non-Jew working for him, who is paid by the week, month, year, etc. (and is thus allowed to work on Shabbos and Yom Tov and Chol ha'Mo'ed also), he may assist him or hire an overseer on Chol ha'Mo'ed, but not on Shabbos or Yom Tov. Rebbe, however, permits a Jew to assist the farmhand in arranging this kind of fertilization on Shabbos as long as he does it for free, and on Yom Tov he may work for food, and on Chol ha'Mo'ed he may work for pay.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosef):</span> The Halachah is like Rebbe (in 4:c).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>MISHNAH - A REPEAT OF THE FIRST MISHNAH, ONLY ABOUT WINE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>If someone pressed his grapes (and the wine will spoil if not stored away quickly), but he was unable to store it because he became a mourner or because his workers didn't show up or some other good excuse, R. Yehudah says he may do the minimum to prevent the spoiling of the wine, and leave the rest for later.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yosi says the entire barrelling process may be followed as usual. (Because once something is a Davar ha'Aved R. Yosi permits doing Melachah in the usual manner, without Shinui.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>GEMARA - SOME COMMENTS ON THE MISHNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>It was necessary for the Mishnah to discuss both the case of oil and that of wine, because oil costs much more than wine. If we were only told about the disagreement between R. Yosi and R. Yehudah in the case of wine we might have thought that when it comes to oil R. Yehudah agrees to the lenient position. If we were only told about it in the case of oil we would have thought that when it comes to wine R. Yosi agrees to the stringent position.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Observation (R. Yitzchak bar Abba):</span> If you ever find a Tana who requires a Shinui for a Davar ha'Aved on Chol ha'Mo'ed, you will know that it's not R. Yosi talking.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosef):</span> The Halachah is in accordance with R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Ruling (R. Papa):</span> One may seal (Rashi) a beer barrel on Chol ha'Mo'ed, because it is a Davar ha'Aved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Observation (R. Chama bar Guria):</span> The laws of Chol ha'Mo'ed are like the laws of dealing with Cuthites (Samaritans): Each case is judged individually, and one cannot draw a conclusion from one case to another.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>An example is lining a jug with pitch. Shmuel permitted it for a small jug, but not for a large jug (too much exertion).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Dimi of Neharde'a said the opposite - it is permitted for a large jug, but not for a small jug (not enough loss involved to justify the work).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Observation (Abaye):</span> The laws of Chol ha'Mo'ed are like the laws of Shabbos, in that some things are completely permitted and others are not actually permitted but are not punishable offenses either. (It is not clear what cases Abaye is referring to; see Rishonim.)</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>HARVESTING ON CHOL HA'MO'ED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rav Huna had his field harvested on Chol ha'Mo'ed, because the crop would have spoiled if he had waited until after Chol ha'Mo'ed</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is a Beraisa that says that Melachos may be done on Chol ha'Mo'ed for a Davar ha'Aved only if they involved detached food; any work with crops that are still growing in the field is forbidden, even for Davar ha'Aved. (The Beraisa adds that if someone really doesn't have anything else to eat he may harvest, bundle, thresh - but not with an animal - winnow, etc.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Beraisa is a minority opinion, namely that of R. Yosi, as may be seen from another Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Beraisa expresses R. Yosi's opinion, why does one have to thresh without animals? We learned above (11b, #1, and 12a, #5) that R. Yosi does not require a Shinui for a Davar ha'Aved!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not because of Shinui that the use of animals is forbidden, because people thresh without animals very often. The reason animals are not allowed is because it would be too loud and noticeable.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>DOING MELACHAH FOR THE HOLIDAY VS. FOR AFTER THE HOLIDAY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Beraisa:</span> One may grind grain, cut wood and prepare beer for the holiday, but not for after the holiday. If leftovers happen to remain, however, they may be used after the holiday. It is forbidden to intentionally make enough for leftovers for after the holiday.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This contradicts another Beraisa, which permits intentionally making enough beer for leftovers, by drinking from the new batches and leaving the old batches for later.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This issue is a disagreement between two Tana'im, as seen from yet another Beraisa. The Tana Kama forbids it, and R. Yosi bar Yehudah permits it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>CUTTING THINGS FROM THE GROUND ON CHOL HA'MO'ED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rav's harvest:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Story:</span> Rav allowed his field to be harvested on Chol ha'Mo'ed. Shmuel became angry at him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was Shmuel angry? We established above (7) that according to the majority opinion it is permitted to harvest a crop if it is in danger of spoiling. Did Shmuel hold like the minority opinion?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was a wheat crop, which would not have suffered at all if it had been left until after the holiday.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did Rav harvest the crop?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did not have anything else to eat, and in this case it is permitted, as above 7:b.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why was Shmuel angry at him?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Shmuel was unaware of the fact that Rav had nothing else to eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Shmuel was of the opinion that even though it is permitted in this case, an important rabbi should be more stringent for himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>More about the need for an important rabbi to be extra stringent</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Story:</span> Rav Yehudah Nesi'ah went outside on Shabbos wearing a fancy signet ring. He also drank water that was boiled by a non-Jewish cook. R. Ami became angry with him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was R. Ami angry? Both of these practices are explicitly permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Ami felt that an important rabbi should be more stringent than the basic requirements of the Halachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Chopping down trees on Chol ha'Mo'ed</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav said that a tree may be cut down on Chol ha'Mo'ed even if one only needs a few chips of wood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Abaye put a curse on anyone who would follow this practice.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Story:</span> R. Ashi had a forest, which he went to chop down on Chol ha'Mo'ed. R. Shila reminded him about Abaye's curse. R. Ashi informed him that he disagreed with Abaye about this. After this he had a close call with an accident with the ax, and took it as an omen to stop chopping.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Rav Yehudah's three leniencies:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Yehudah permitted picking flax, cutting hops, and picking sesames on Chol ha'Mo'ed</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is a use on Chol ha'Mo'ed for flax (covering fruit) and hops (making beer), but of what use is raw sesame on Chol ha'Mo'ed?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You can press oil from the seeds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yannai's orchard</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Story:</span> R. Yannai once harvested his orchards on Chol ha'Mo'ed (because it was a Davar ha'Aved - Rabeinu Chananel). The next year everyone went and harvested their orchards on Chol ha'Mo'ed (though they were not Davar ha'Aved). R. Yannai punished himself (for being the source of a misunderstanding) and disowned his entire crop of that year.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">10)</span><p>MISHNAH - MORE EXAMPLES OF DAVAR HA'AVED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>It is permitted to put away the harvested crop into storage if one fears theft.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>It is permitted to remove flax from the water where it was soaking, to prevent loss.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>All these leniencies of Davar ha'Aved may not be intentionally left to be done on Chol ha'Mo'ed. If someone does intentionally leave his work for Chol ha'Mo'ed, the products of his labor become banned as a punishment.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Beraisa:</span> When putting away the crop into storage it must be done discreetly.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Story:</span> Rav Yosef once moved a pile of beams indoors on Chol ha'Mo'ed in broad daylight.
