<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PROCEDURE FOR SUMMONING TO COURT (WHICH CAN LEAD TO <i>NIDUY</i>)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>1-6 are derived from the case of Moshe vs. Korach (except where indicated); 7 and on are derived from various other sources.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A summons must be sent to the defendant by the court (not by the claimant - Ritva)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Mention is made (where applicable) of the fact that the case is to be tried before a great judge.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The identity of the challenging litigant is given.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A specific time is set for the trial.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>If he ignores the first summons a second chance is given. (Derived from Yirmiyahu.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>If the court's messenger is treated disrespectfully he may report it, and it is not considered to be Lashon Hara.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>If the summons is ignored again (Ritva) the offender is put into Niduy.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>The identity of the rabbi who issues the Niduy must be made known.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>A Cherem (a type of curse, worse than a Niduy) may also be issued against the offender if necessary.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>The court can (if they so desire - Ritva) put into Cherem anyone who associates with a Menudeh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span>The Menudeh's offense is made known to the public.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span>In addition to Niduy the following steps may be taken to enforce obedience to the court: Confiscation of property, physical coercion, cursing, imposing oaths, incarceration, Hardafah (= many Niduyim, one after the other, as below 1:b:1).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>How to initiate a Niduy:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> Niduy may be declared immediately, without prior notification. (This is part of the Hardafah mentioned above). [Further information: Thirty days after the first Niduy it can be renewed. Thirty days after that a Cherem is issued.]</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Huna):</span> Three warnings (Monday, Thursday, Monday) are given first.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is only true for monetary issues. But for insolence to a Talmid Chacham there is no warning.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>EARLY ANNULMENT OF NIDUY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Story:</span> A certain butcher was put into Niduy for insolence to a rabbi. He then apologized before the thirty days were over.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Should the Niduy be lifted early?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Pro:</span> Because the rabbis need to buy meat from him, and they would suffer from a prolongation of the Niduy. (This is Rashi's reading. Almost all other Rishonim have: Because the rabbis who issued the Niduy have to leave town, and only they can annul the Niduy [see below, 3:a and 3:b]. We do not want the butcher to be stuck in Niduy forever.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Con:</span> A Niduy is supposed to be a full thirty-day punishment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Idi bar Avin):</span> Shmuel said that just as a Niduy may be imposed summarily (through the "toot" of a shofar), so can it be lifted summarily.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is only true for Niduy that was imposed for a monetary reason (refusal to pay court-ordered payment), but if it was imposed for reason of insolence the Niduy must stay for 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHO MAY ANNUL A <i>NIDUY</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Niduy is imposed by three particular rabbis, must they be the ones who annul it, or can it be annulled by another three rabbis?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Observation:</span> Abaye apparently held you need the same three rabbis. (According to other Rishonim above in 2:b:1 this conclusion is obvious. According to Rashi ibid. it is less obvious; see Rashi s.v. Lo Asu.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A Beraisa is brought to prove that you need the same three rabbis. This Beraisa makes several points:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a rabbi imposes a Niduy on someone all his disciples must observe the Niduy (and shun the offender), but not vice versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a Niduy is imposed on someone in his home town it must be observed everywhere else as well, but not vice versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If a Nasi imposes a Niduy, it must be observed by all Jews, but not vice versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> If one of the three rabbis who imposed the Niduy dies before it is annulled, his portion of the Niduy is not annulled. (The Gemara assumes that this means that the Niduy can never be annulled, providing the answer to 3:a.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Three observations on this Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Concerning 3:</span>c:1: The Niduy in question is obviously one imposed due to insolence, for if it was due to a transgression of a religious law, certainly even a rabbi would have to follow his disciple's Niduy. We may hence derive that a mere disciple (and not only a major rabbi) may impose a Niduy if he is insulted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Each of the three rabbis is considered to be "in charge" of his third of the Niduy (since the word "portion" is used), and may thus annul it individually, without the two others (Nimukei Yosef).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">The question from 3:</span>a is answered: The same three rabbis who imposed the Niduy must be the ones who annul it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion of discussion:</span> The three rabbis who annul the Niduy need <b>NOT</b> be the same ones who imposed it. What Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel meant (3:c:4) was that if one of the three original rabbis dies, someone else must take his place (to make a total of three) in the annulment process. (That is, we do not say just because one of the rabbis died his portion is automatically annulled.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>NEZIFAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Beraisa:</span> Besides Niduy there is also something called Nezifah (censure), which lasts for only seven days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Statement (R. Chisda):</span> What we call Niduy in Babylonia is not a real Niduy, and is in fact only Nezifah, lasting only seven days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (on the Beraisa of 4:a):</span> There are two instances where Rebbi was insulted by people and they observed Nezifah for thirty days, not seven.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first case was with Bar Kapara, who said, "What would Rebbi know about this matter?"</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The second case was with R. Chiya, who disagreed with and disobeyed Rebbi's ruling that Torah should not be taught out in the open (in the streets), but in a more private setting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since Rebbi was the Nasi, his Nezifah was much more powerful than a regular Nezifah, and therefore lasted thirty days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Niduy in Babylonia lasts only seven days (above, 4:b), then how long does a Babylonian Nezifah last?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>One day, as seen from a story involving Mar Ukva and Shmuel, and another one involving a woman and R. Nachman, and another one involving Zutra bar Toviah and Rav Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>AGADETA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A discussion of what is meant by "David's latter words" (II Shmuel 23:1).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A discussion of the meaning of the word "Kushi".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>David made Teshuvah easier for all of us, by setting an example.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A Tzadik rules over (as it were) Hash-m, because he can, through his prayers, influence Him to annul a decree He has already made against someone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A homiletical interpretation of II Shmuel 23:8.</p>
