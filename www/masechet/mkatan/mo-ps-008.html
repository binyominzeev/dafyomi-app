<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DISCUSSION OF DERIVATION MENTIONED ABOVE, 7b, 8:b:1.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How exactly did R. Yehudah derive from "On the day when it is seen on [the Metzora]..." that there are certain days when a Kohen should not examine Negaim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The prefix "u" of "uv'Yom" is extra, and therefore serves as a basis for the said derivation.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The entire word uv'Yom is extra.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Here there is a discussion of how Abaye relates to Rava's approach and vice versa, how we know that Nega'im are not inspected at night, and how we know that an inspecting Kohen must be able to see with both eyes.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MISHNAH - REINTERMENT AND MOURNING DURING CHOL HA'MO'ED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Meir allows reinterment for one's parents' remains on Chol ha'Mo'ed, because it is a happy, not sad occasion. R. Yosi considers it to be a sad event, and therefore forbids it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One may not bewail or lament a dead person within thrity days of a Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>GEMARA - QUESTION ON R. MEIR'S OPINION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can R. Meir say reinterment is a joyous event? There is a Beraisa which requires a one-day (but not into the night) mourning period upon reinterment of a parent's remains!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir's words should not be interpreted as "because it [reinterment] is a happy occasion," but as "because it [Chol ha'Mo'ed] is a happy occasion, and this joy will overshadow the sadness of reinterment."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>DEFINITION OF THE MISHNAH'S BEWAIL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>What is to "bewail"? In Eretz Yisrael they used to say, "Let all those of bitter heart weep with him." This is "bewailing."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>DISCUSSION OF THE NATURE OF THE MISHNAH'S THIRTY-DAY PERIOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why thirty days?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Because one might spend money that he had saved up for Yom Tov on hiring a professional lamenter.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> Because the sad emotions stirred up in the lament last for thirty days and will interfere with one's Simchas Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The practical difference between the two answers: Holding a lamentation ceremony without paid lamenters.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>MISHNAH - THREE LAWS ABOUT CHOL HA'MO'ED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One may not dig a new Kuch (little burial caves for individual bodies) or grave on Chol ha'Mo'ed, but they may be altered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">One may make a Nivreches (Rashi:</span> a laundering pool; others: a kind of grave) on Chol ha'Mo'ed</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One may make a coffin (from scratch) in the same courtyard-complex where the deceased is. R. Yehudah forbids this, unless the boards used are already cut.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p><i>GEMARA</i> - DEFINITON OF TERMS FOR 6:a AND 6:b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between a "Kuch" and a "grave"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A "Kuch" is dug in the ground; a "grave" is dug in a building.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is meant by "altering"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah):</span> Shortening it to size. Beraisa's answer: Lengthening and widening it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a Nivreches?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is the same as a "Bekia."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa makes it clear that Nivreches and Bekia are two different things.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are similar, but slightly different. One is a large pool, and the other is a smaller overflow pool built at the side of the larger pool (Rashi).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>APROPOS TO 6:c</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Mishnah implies that according to theTana Kama boards may be cut anew for a coffin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">This fact is corroborated by a Beraisa:</span> "One may perform all requirements for a dead person  (on Chol ha'Mo'ed) - cutting his hair, laundering his clothes, and constructing a coffin from pre-existing boards (corresponding to R. Yehudah in our Mishnah). Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel (corresponding to the Tana Kama in our Mishnah) says new boards may also be cut for a coffin, provided it is done indoors, in private.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>MISHNAH - FOUR TOPICS ABOUT CHOL HA'MO'ED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One may not marry (except for remarrying one's own divorcee) on Chol ha'Mo'ed because it is a joyous activity.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A woman may perform all kinds of beauty care on Chol ha'Mo'ed, R. Yehudah, however, forbids using lime treatment because it causes her to become unsightly in the short run (during the holiday).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A non-skilled person may sew on Chol ha'Mo'ed, but a professional must do so in an unusual ("doglike") manner.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The ropes that hold the mattress of a bed may be intertwined on Chol ha'Mo'ed according to the Tana Kama. R. Yosi says the ropes may only be tightened.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">10)</span><p>WHY ONE MAY NOT MARRY ON CHOL HA'MO'ED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should marriage be forbidden on Chol ha'Mo'ed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> Because one may not mingle one joy (Chol ha'Mo'ed) wth another (marriage).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Because a person will become preoccupied with his rejoicing over his wife and neglect his Simchas Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> Because getting married involves many preparations and exertions.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> Because if marriage were allowed on Chol ha'Mo'ed everyone would postpone their weddings to that convenient time, thus leading to delaying the Mitzvah of procreation.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa says that it is permitted to marry the day before Yom Tov - although festivities continue for seven days. This seems to contradict all four reasons.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The main joy of marriage is the wedding day, not afterwards. (This answers for reasons (b) and (c.)) The main exertion involved in wedding plans is only for the wedding day, not afterwards (This answers for reason (d)) People will not postpone their weddings for a mere one-day slot, lest something go wrong. (This answers for reason (e)).</p></div>
