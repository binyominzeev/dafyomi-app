<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A MOURNER ON THE ROAD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a traveler finds out he has become a mourner, he must cut down on his business. If this is not possible, he should do business in a manner in which he is subordinate to his travelling companions.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MISCELLANEOUS RULES ABOUT OVERTURNING BEDS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There is a dispute as to when the beds should be overturned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> When the deceased is taken from the house.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> When the coffin is closed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A Beraisa discusses what is done for Shabbos:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Friday afternoon the beds are turned upright (see above, 24a, 4:j [counting from 23b]). But the mourners do not sit on them until Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Saturday night the beds are turned over again, even if the Shiv'ah finishes on Sunday.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A Beraisa describes which beds must be overturned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Not only the mourner's bed, but all beds in the house must be overturned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If a brother dies, all the surviving brothers must overturn their beds (although they don't live in the house of the deceased - Ritva).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>A couch not used for lying on, but for storage of items, need not be overturned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>A Dargash does not have to be overturned, but should be stood up on its side (Rashi <b>MS</b>.).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(Raban Shimon Ben Gamliel):</span> For a Dargash, the supporting straps (of the mattress) should be loosened, thus allowing the Dargash to fall by itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a Dargash, anyway?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> A good-luck couch, that is just for decoration (Rashi in Sanhedrin), not use.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Mishnah elsewhere says that a king, when receiving his mourner's meal, sits on a Dargash. If a Dargash is usually not sat on, why should he suddenly sit on it now?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We should not be surprised at this change of routine, just as it is a change of routine that other people bring him food to eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why shouldn't this kind of bed require overturning?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like a bed made for storage (above, 2:c:3).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">vii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The above Beraisa said that for a Dargash the supporting straps (of the mattress) should be loosened. A good-luck bed does not have any such straps! Ula's explanation of Dargash is thus rejected.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">viii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabin):</span> A leather-covered bed or couch.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ix.</span><p><span class="cl">Fact:</span> A bed's straps go over the bed frame; a Dargash's straps are inserted through holes in the wooden frame.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Halachah:</span> R. Yehoshua Ben Levi ruled like Raban Shimon Ben Gamliel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>If a bed has posts extending upwards (e.g., to hold a canopy) (and thus cannot be overturned) it should be stood on its side.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>A Beraisa states that it is not good enough to sleep somewhere other than the bed (such as a chair, or even on the floor);  the bed must be overturned.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>BERAISA ABOUT TIDYING UP IN THE MOURNER'S HOUSE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A Beraisa makes two points:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One may sweep and wash the floor and do the dishes in the mourner's house.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Fragrances and incenses are not to be brought into the mourner's house.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Another Beraisa says that no Berachah is said on the spices or incense in a mourner's house - implying that these things are there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This second Beraisa is talking about the house set aside for the consolers, not the actual mourner's house.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MISHNAH - SOME RULES ABOUT MOURNING AND FUNERALS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The mourner's meal should not be brought in fancy containers or platters, but in a simple basket.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Birkas Aveilim is not recited on Chol ha'Mo'ed, but the Shurah ceremony after the burial is held, and consolations visits are held, but the people should make it short and are then dismissed. Similarly, the bier should not be placed in the street for a Hesped on Chol ha'Mo'ed</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A woman's bier is never placed in the street for a Hesped, for it is not respectful to her.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>GEMARA - SEVERAL BERAISOS ABOUT CHANGES MADE IN MOURNING PRACTICES FOR SOCIAL REASONS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Originally rich people received their mourner's meal in silver and gold containers, while poor people received theirs in simiple baskets. This caused the poor to be embarrassed, and it was instituted that everyone should receive their mourner's meal in simple baskets.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Originally drinks were served to rich mourners in crystal glasses, while the poor were served in inferior glasses. This caused embarrassment to the poor, and it was instituted that everyone should receive their drinks in inferior glasses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Originally rich people's bodies were exposed to lie in state, while poor people's bodies were not (because they were emaciated and not pleasant to look at). This caused the poor to be embarrassed, and it was instituted that all bodies should be covered.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">27b----------------------------------------27b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Originally rich people's bodies were carried on Dargashes (see above, 2:c:5), while poor people's bodies were carried on regular stretchers. This caused the poor to be embarrassed, and it was instituted that everyone should be carried on regular stretchers.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Originally incense was burned under the bodies of those who died of intestinal disease only. This caused living people with intestinal disease embarrassment, and it was instituted that incense should be burned under all bodies.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Originally all articles that came into contact with a woman who had been a Nidah were immersed in a Mikveh after her death. This caused embarrassment to living women who were Nidos, so it was instituted that the articles of all women should be immersed after their deaths.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Originally all articles that came into contact with a man who had been a Zav were immersed in a Mikveh after his death. This caused embarrassment to living men who were Zavim, so it was instituted that the articles of all people should be immersed after their deaths.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Originally people spent so much money on fancy shrouds that people sometimes abandoned their loved ones rather than incur the great expense. Then Raban Gamliel left instructions to be buried himself in a very simple shroud, and people followed his example.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Nowadays people even use shrouds of cheap canvas.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>ELABORATION ON MISHNAH'S CURBING OF FUNERIAL RITES ON CHOL HA'MO'ED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> The avoidance of Hesped on Chol ha'Mo'ed (4:b) does not apply to a Torah scholar. It goes without saying that a Hesped may be made on Chanukah and Purim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Even the Torah scholar may not have a Hesped (on Chol ha'Mo'ed, etc.), however, except in the presence of the body.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Kahana said a Hesped for a Talmid Chacham although the deceased was not present.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The day the sad news is received is equivalent to having the Talmid Chacham's bier present.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>DESCRIPTIONS AND RULES FOR GESTURES OF MOURNING.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Ula's definitions:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>To Sofed is to beat the chest in mourning.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>To Metape'ach is to clap the hands in mourning.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>To Mekales is to stamp the feet in mourning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A Beraisa states that one should not do Mekales with sandals but with shoes, because a sandal might slip and hurt his foot.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>ETIQUETTE AND RULES FOR MOURNERS AND CONSOLERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Consolers should not hang around too long; once the mourner nods his head (a sign of consolation) they should leave.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Everyone must stand up for a Nasi, except for a mourner and a sick person.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One should not say, "Sit down" (which in Hebrew could also mean "stay there") to a mourner or sick person.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> A mourner may not eat his own food (but only that of others) on the first day. This is derived from Yechezkel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> When there is a death in town everyone must refrain from work.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Hamnuna):</span> If there is a Chevra Kadisha they need not refrain.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One may not grieve too much over their departed relative.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>A Beraisa (Rabbeinu Chananel) says the same idea, and derives it from a Pasuk, and elaborates: Three days are for crying, seven for Hesped, thirty days for refraining from cutting hair and wearing pressed clothes. It is inappropriate to do more than that.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>At this point the Gemara discusses the rest of the Pasuk quoted above (8:g).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> For the first three days a mourner should feel as if his life is at risk, for the rest of Shiv'ah less so, from then on (for twelve months - Tosfos) less so.</p></div>
