<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>MISHNAH</i>: THE THREE CATEGORIES OF ACTIVITY DURING CHOL HA'MO'ED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Watering crops that would become ruined without irrigation (Beis ha'Shalchin), i.e. preventing monetary loss (Davar ha'Aved):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It may be done from a new or established spring, and may be done on Shemitah also.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It may not be done from rainwater gathered in wells, cisterns, etc. (because this is too much exertion).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One may not dig circles in the ground around the bases of vines (to hold water) (also too much exertion).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Elazar ben Azaryah forbids making a new water channel (on Shemitah also). The Chachamim permit making a new one on Shemitah and repairing an existing one on Chol ha'Mo'ed</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Attending to public needs is permitted, for example:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Fixing problems in the public water supply</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Fixing roads</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Fixing Mikva'os</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Marking graves to prevent Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chol ha'Mo'ed Pesach is the time when special inspectors went to look for Kil'ayim growing in fields and destroy it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>NEW OR ESTABLISHED SPRINGS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>New springs are more problematic than established ones, because they might collapse and require fixing (which is prohibited because of exertion).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Mishnah permits even new ones, why mention established ones?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the Mishnah had remained silent about established ones, one might have thought that it is permitted even for crops that do not depend on irrigation, but do improve with some irrigation (Beis ha'Ba'al). Therefore, it is mentioned in order to teach that it is permitted only for Beis ha'Shalchin.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ETYMOLOGIES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Shalchin is from the Aramaic Meshalhei ("thirsty").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Ba'al is from Yeshayah 62:5, meaning "settled".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHO IS THE AUTHOR OF THE <i>MISHNAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah clearly implies that watering is permitted (1) only to prevent loss (Beis ha'Shalchin), but not for monetary gain (Beis ha'Ba'al). And even this is (2) only permitted when there is not too much exertion. Whose opinion is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Eliezer ben Yakov, in the Mishnah on 6b.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Refutation:</span> But this shows only point (2), not point (1)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Yehudah of a Beraisa, which states three opinions about using a new spring:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir permits watering even a Beis ha'Ba'al, which certainly is against the Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah permits only a Beis ha'Shalchin that has become disconnected from its usual spring.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Elazar ben Azaryah forbids even this (only established springs may be used).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah adds:</span> It is prohibited to dredge out a channel and use this water for one's garden, because of exertion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>So we see from R. Yehudah both point (1) [from 4:c:2] and point (2) [from 4:c:4].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This Beraisa discusses only a new spring. We don't know what R. Yehudah would say about an established spring - perhaps he would permit even Beis ha'Ba'al, against the Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah is the only one who can possibly be identified with the Mishnah, so he probably means exactly what the Mishnah says.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHY ARE WEEDING AND WATERING PROHIBITED ON SHABBOS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> They come under the category of "Plowing", because they loosen the soil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> They come under "Sowing", because they generate growth of surrounding plants.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Why can't both prohibitions apply? It is, after all, possible to transgress two prohibitions with one act, as Rav Kahana said about one who prunes a tree and also intends to use the pruned branches ("Detaching" and "Sowing"). The question remains unanswered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question on Rav Yosef:</span> A Beraisa says that one who weeds [or covers seeds with dirt] in a field of Kil'ayim violates the prohibition of Kil'ayim, which is "In your field you shall not sow Kil'ayim." Obviously, then, weeding comes under "Sowing."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Beraisa holds like R. Akiva, who says that even retaining Kil'ayim is a prohibition.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> From where does R. Akiva derive this prohibition of "retaining Kil'ayim"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He rearranges the punctuation of the verse to ["You shall not intermingle your animals as] Kil'ayim in your field you shall not [sow Kil'ayim]" - to get "Kil'ayim in your field you shall not", meaning even to retain what is already there.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>WHY DOES THE <i>MISHNAH</i> PERMIT WATERING ON <i>SHEMITAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whether watering comes under "Plowing" or "Sowing" it should be prohibited on Shemitah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Our Mishnah holds like Rebbi, who says that Shemitah (ever since Sancheriv) has been only mid'Rabanan, and the Rabanan were lenient in cases of monetary loss.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>How do we know that Rebbi holds Shemitah is mid'Rabanan nowadays? Because he says "At those times when Shemitah of the land applies, so does Shemitah of loans apply," implying that there are times when Shemitah does not apply (mid'Oraisa).</p>
