<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>KOSHER CHILDREN FROM MAMZERIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Tarfon):</span> A Mamzer can cause that his children will be permitted to marry Yisre'elim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he marries a Shifchah Kena'anis, the children are slaves. If he frees them, they are regular converts;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer says, the children are Mamzer slaves. (If they are freed, they are Mamzerim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Did R. Tarfon say that a slave may do this l'Chatchilah, or only b'Dieved?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa - Chachamim (to R. Tarfon)):</span> This helps a male Mamzer, but not a Mamzeres!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Mamzerim may marry slaves, also a Mamzeres could marry a slave to permit her children! (If it is forbidden, a Mamzer would need to relocate and claim that he is a slave. This is reasonable for a male but not for a female.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. There is no lineage to slaves. (His children would be like the mother (Mamzerim).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Simlai told his innkeeper (a Mamzer) 'had I known you earlier, I could have caused that your children will be permitted (to marry Yisre'elim).'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand this if R. Tarfon's counsel is l'Chatchilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If R. Tarfon's Heter is b'Dieved, R. Simlai would not tell someone to transgress!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He would have told him to steal (so he will be sold to be an Eved Ivri (Yisrael slave), who is permitted to a Shifchah. This is permitted in order to permit one's children.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The law of Eved Ivri did not apply in R. Simlai's time!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The law of Eved Ivri applies only when Yovel applies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> R. Tarfon's counsel is l'Chatchilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Tarfon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> The children are Mamzer slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> R. Eliezer learns from "to him" (in the Lav for Mamzerim to marry Yisre'elim) - if either parent is a Mamzer, the children receive this blemish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Chachamim say, the verse applies only to a Yisrael who married a Mamzeres;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "to their families, according to their father's houses" teaches that the children are like the father!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "To him" forbids all descendants of Mamzerim (even if they marry Yisre'elim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> Just like "to him" overrides the rule "to their families, according to their father's houses", it also overrides the rule "the (slave) and her children will be to her master"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Chachamim say, a fetus inside a slave has no connection to its father.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK ASARAH YUCHSIN</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE TEN GENEOLOGICAL STOCKS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Ten different lineages came up with Ezra from Bavel: Kohen, Levi, Yisrael, Chalal, convert, freed slave, Mamzer, Nasin, Shesuki (one who knows his mother but not his father), Asufi (a deserted baby, who does not know either of his parents).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Kohanim, Leviyim and Yisre'elim may marry each other;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Leviyim, Yisre'elim, Chalalim, converts, and freed slaves may marry each other;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Converts, freed slaves, Mamzerim, Nesinim, Shtukim and Asufim may all marry each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Aba Sha'ul says we can check (the Kashrus of) a Shesuki (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>EZRA'S ASCENT TO ERETZ YISRAEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah say 'came up from Bavel'? It should say 'went to Eretz Yisrael'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches that Eretz Yisrael is the highest of all lands.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "You will go up to the place that Hash-m will choose" teaches that the Beis ha'Mikdash is the highest place in Eretz Yisrael, and Eretz Yisrael is the highest land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Granted, we learn that the Beis ha'Mikdash is the highest place in Eretz Yisrael from "you will go up";</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">69b----------------------------------------69b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we learn that Eretz Yisrael is the highest land?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "(People will recount how) Hash-m raised and brought Bnei Yisrael (to Eretz Yisrael) from the north and from all lands of their dispersion"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah say 'came up from Bavel'? It should say 'came up to Eretz Yisrael'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This alludes to R. Elazar's teaching:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Ezra didn't leave Bavel until he made it like clean flour (he took all the Pesulim with him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The Mishnah says (that people of improper lineage) 'came up', they chose to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It says that he (Ezra) forced them to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rava holds like R. Elazar, but Abaye does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Alternatively, both hold like R. Elazar. Abaye holds that Ezra publicized the Pesulim, and then they choose to come. Rava holds that he forced them to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> All other lands are like dough (mixed with Pesulim) compared to Eretz Yisrael. Eretz Yisrael is like dough compared to Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, according to Abaye, the Pesulim came on their own (others did not know about them, and married the Pesulim in Eretz Yisrael), therefore Eretz Yisrael is like dough compared to Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rava, Ezra forced them to come. Surely, they were known in Eretz Yisrael. Eretz Yisrael should also be pure!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They were known in the generation of Ezra, but not in later generations.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Abaye, we understand "I studied the people and the Kohanim. I did not find any Leviyim";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rava, Ezra forced them to come. He already knew who came!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He only forced Pesulim to come. He did not know which Kosher lineages came.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kohanim, Leviyim and Yisre'elim (came with Ezra).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that they came up?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "The Kohanim and the Leviyim sat... and Yisrael."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE STRENGTH OF CHAZAKAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chalalim, converts and freed slaves (came).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Chalalim came?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Rebbi Yosi):</span> We learn the power of Chazakah from "Bnei ha'Kohanim... who married daughters of Barzilai ha'Giladi... they could not find their lineage documents, and they were banished from Kehunah. Ha'Tarshasta (Nechemyah) told them, they will not eat Kodshei Kodoshim until the Urim v'Turim are restored (when Moshi'ach comes)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He told them that since they had a Chazakah (in Bavel) to eat Terumah, they may continue to eat Terumah in Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that eating Terumah is a proof of proper lineage (for marriage), perhaps people will see them eat, and assume that their lineage is fine!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They will not, for their Chazakah was weakened (Rashi - since they may not eat Kodshim; Tosfos - since they could not find their lineage documents).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, how does this show the power of Chazakah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In Bavel, they only ate Terumah mid'Rabanan. In Eretz Yisrael, they may eat Terumah mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to question (d)):</span> Also in Eretz Yisrael, they are only permitted Terumah mid'Rabanan. Only eating Terumah mid'Oraisa proves proper lineage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, how does this show the power of Chazakah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In Eretz Yisrael, there was concern lest they come to eat Terumah mid'Oraisa. Due to the power of Chazakah, no decree was made about mid'Rabanan Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "They will not eat Kodshei Kodoshim until the Urim v'Turim are restored" implies that they could eat everything else!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. It means that they may not eat what is called Kodesh (Terumah mid'Oraisa), nor what is called Kodshim (the chest and foreleg of Shelamim, which is given to Kohanim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Terumah is called Kodesh - "any non-Kohen will not eat Kodesh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The chest and foreleg are called Kodshim - "a Bas Kohen who will marry a non-Kohen may not eat Terumas ha'Kodoshim".</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This refers to the chest and foreleg, which are taken from Kodshim.</p>
