<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TIMES THAT ONE PARTY IS BELIEVED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, he sold to the one who paid him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, both paid him. He says that he took from one willingly, and the other forced the money into his hand, and we do not know from which he took willingly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A judge is believed to say which party won the case and which party must pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only when the parties are in front of him. If not, he is not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should look at the written verdict!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it was torn up.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should judge them again!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the verdict was based on Shuda (Rashi - the judge's estimation; Tosfos - the judge's discretion, whom he prefers to favor). Perhaps he will rule unlike his first ruling.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Three are believed about a firstborn: the midwife, the father and the mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The midwife is believed only right away. The mother is believed the first seven days. The father is believed forever (after this).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - Rebbi Yehudah):</span> "Yakir" - the father will make known whom is his firstborn;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that a man is believed to say which son is his firstborn. Similarly, he is believed to say that a certain son was born from a divorcee or Chalutzah (so the son is a Chalal);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, he is not believed to say that his son is a Chalal.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CHECKING SHETUKIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Aba Sha'ul would call a Shetuki 'Beduki' (checked).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We ask his mother. If she says that his father is Kosher, she is believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like R. Gamliel (in the Mishnah below)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learned this argument in another Mishnah! (Aba Shaul's opinion should have been taught there, with R. Gamliel's!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Gamliel and R. Eliezer):</span> If a single girl was pregnant and she said 'the father is Ploni. He is Kosher', she is believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua says, she is not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Mishnah teaches that we believe the girl that she was not disqualified from Kehunah. Our Mishnah teaches that she is believed about the child.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that even R. Gamliel and R. Eliezer believe her only about herself, but not about the child. Aba Sha'ul teaches that she is believed even about the child;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that R. Gamliel and R. Eliezer believe her even about the child, Aba Sha'ul does not teach anything new!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that she is believed only when most men in the city are permitted to her. Aba Sha'ul teaches that she is permitted even when most are forbidden to her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah follows Aba Sha'ul.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FORBIDDEN LINEAGES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All who may not marry into the Kahal, are permitted to each other;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rebbi Yehudah forbids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Elazar says, Vadai (definite) Mamzerim may marry Vadai Mamzerim. Safek Mamzerim may not marry Vadai or Safek Mamzerim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Safek Mamzerim are Shetuki, Asufi and Kusi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does 'all who may not marry into the Kahal' refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It refers to Mamzerim, Nesinim, Shetukim and Asufim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> The first Mishnah taught this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> If so, what does Rebbi Yehudah forbid?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He forbids Safek Mamzerim from marrying Vadai Mamzerim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Elazar forbids this in the Seifa. This implies that Rebbi Yehudah permits it!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rebbi Yehudah forbids a convert to marry a Mamzeres.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Mishnah did not mention converts. It discusses those who may not enter the Kahal!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">74b----------------------------------------74b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mishnah teaches that all who may not enter Kehal Kehunah, e.g. a girl who converted before three years old (unlike R. Shimon), may marry each other (i.e. she may marry a convert).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he say that it discusses a girl who converted above three years old, like R. Shimon?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This would imply that had she converted before three years old, she would be (permitted to Kohanim, like R. Shimon, and) forbidden to other converts. This is not true.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> The rule of the Mishnah (like Rav Yehudah explains) is not always true!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A widow (may not marry a Kohen Gadol, and a) divorcee, Chalalah, or Zonah cannot marry Kohanim. They are not permitted to everyone else who is forbidden (such as Mamzerim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> The Mishnah implies that someone permitted to Kehunah (e.g. a convert, who may marry a Bas Kohen) is forbidden to Pesulim. (Rav Yehudah holds that the Tana permits a Mamzer to a convert, i.e. converts are not considered Kehal, so) a convert may marry a Mamzeres!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Nasan bar Oshiya):</span> The Mishnah says that anyone who may not marry his daughter to a Kohen, e.g. a convert who married a convert, according to R. Eliezer ben Yakov, may marry other such people (converts).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We do not permit all such people (whose daughters may not marry Kohanim) to each other!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If a Chalal married a Bas Yisrael, his daughter (a Chalalah) may not marry a Kohen, yet a Chalal cannot marry a Mamzeres!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is like R. Dostai ben Yehudah (who says that children of a Chalal from a Bas Yisrael are Kesheirim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If a Chalal married a Chalalah, all agree that his daughter is a Chalalah, who may not marry a Kohen, yet a Chalal may not marry a Mamzeres!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> The Mishnah implies that one whose daughter is permitted to Kehunah (e.g. a convert who married a Bas Yisrael) is forbidden to Pesulim. A convert may marry a Mamzeres (for R. Nasan holds that the Tana holds that converts are not considered Kehal)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Nachman):</span> The Tana'im argue about whether or not Mamzerim result from siblings that marry each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana says that the children are Mamzerim. Rebbi Yehudah says that Mamzerim result from adultery, but not from siblings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We already learned this argument in another Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> Mamzerim result from any Bi'ah forbidden by a Lav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shimon ha'Teimani says, they result from any Ervah punishable by Kares. The Halachah follows him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehoshua says, they result from any Ervah punishable by death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rava):</span> The Tana'im argue about Amoni and Mo'avi converts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana says that anyone who may not enter the Kahal, e.g. an Amoni or Mo'avi convert, may marry other such people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does Rebbi Yehudah forbid?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, even though Rebbi Yehudah forbids a convert to marry a Mamzeres, that refers only to converts permitted to Yisre'elim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He agrees that Amonim and Mo'avim, who are forbidden to Yisrael, may marry Mamzerim.</p>
