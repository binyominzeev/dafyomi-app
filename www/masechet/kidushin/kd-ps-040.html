<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A woman asked R. Chanina bar Papa to sin with her. He said something, which caused his body to be covered with boils. She healed him (through witchcraft).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Chanina hid in a bathhouse that was inhabited by very strong Mazikim (damaging spirits) that can harm even two people during the day. He was not harmed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rabanan (who did not know why he entered):</span> What saved you?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> Two people who carry the Kaiser guarded me all night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Perhaps you were tempted to sin (sexually) and overcame it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one is tempted to sin (sexually) and overcomes it, a miracle is done for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>A woman tempted R. Tzadok to sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Tzadok:</span> I am too weak. Do you have anything to eat?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The woman:</span> I have only meat of a Tamei animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Tzadok:</span> That is what I deserve!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>While she was heating the oven, R. Tzadok entered it. He explained that this is (a taste of) his future punishment (burning in Gehinom) for sinning. She left him alone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rav Kahana was selling women's baskets. A woman asked him to sin; he said that he needed time to adorn himself. He went to the roof and jumped off. Eliyahu caught him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Eliyahu:</span> You made me come a tremendous distance to save you!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Kahana:</span> My poverty forced me into this profession!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Eliyahu gave him much money, so he could quit his job.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DIVIDENDS ON MITZVOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> For the following Mitzvos, the principal reward is saved for the world to come, and one enjoys dividends of the Mitzvos in this world: honoring parents; bestowing Chesed; and making Shalom between people. Torah is equal to all of them together.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"In order that your days will be lengthened and it will be good for you" teaches about honoring parents;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"One who pursues Tzedakah and Chesed will find life, Tzedakah and honor" teaches about bestowing Chesed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Redifah-Redifah" to "seek Shalom and pursue it" to teach about making Shalom between people;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"It is your life and the length of your days" teaches about Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding sending the mother bird, it also says "in order that it will be good for you and your days will be lengthened". Why isn't this listed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Tana omitted some Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> He said "these Mitzvos." Surely he did not omit any!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava) Question:</span> "A good Tzadik... will eat the Peros (dividends) of his deeds." Are there Tzadikim who are not good?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, a Tzadik who is good to Hash-m and people is a good Tzadik. A Tzadik who is good to Hash-m but bad to people is not a good Tzadik.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Similarly, it says "woe to an evil Rasha, he will be paid like his actions." are not all Resha'im evil?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, one who is evil to Hash-m and to people is an evil Rasha. One who is evil to Hash-m but not to people is not an evil Rasha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Merit has principal and dividends - "A good Tzadik (will eat the Peros...)" Sins have principal (for punishment) but not Peros - "woe to the Rasha..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "they will eat the Peros of their ways, and will be satiated from their (evil) counsel"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> For sins that have Peros (cause others to sin), the punishment has Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>One is rewarded for a good intention.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> "Ul'Choshvei Shemo" - if one Choshav (intended) to do a Mitzvah, but was unable, the verse considers it as if he did it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Hash-m does not punish for a bad intent - "if I saw sin in my heart, Hash-m will not hear".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "I will bring to this nation evil, the Peros of their thoughts"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If a bad intention is fulfilled, Hash-m punishes (additionally) for the intent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "In order to trap Bnei Yisrael in their hearts"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> That discusses idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Idolatry is severe. One who denies idolatry is like one who admits to the entire Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ula):</span> Hash-m punishes for intention to repeat a sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Once one sins and repeats the sin, it becomes permitted to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he considers it to be permitted.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE RESULTS OF SINS AND MITZVOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> It is better to sin privately and not desecrate Hash-m's name in public - "go serve your idols; you do not heed Me, do not profane My Holy name."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ila'i ha'Zaken):</span> If one feels his evil inclination overpowering him, he should go to a place where people don't recognize him, cover himself in black, and do like his heart desires. This way, he will not desecrate Hash-m's name. (Humbling himself can subdue the Yetzer. And even if it does not, people will not pay attention to his sin.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Anyone who is not concerned for the Creator's honor should not have come to the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> This discusses one who gazes at a rainbow (it is a semblance of Kavod ha'Shechinah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> This is one who sins in private.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yosef discusses one who could have overcome his inclination. R. Ila'i discusses one who was unable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Mishnah says 'Hashem is not Makif regarding Chilul Hash-m, whether Shogeg or Mezid'. What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mar Zutra):</span> Hash-m does not extend credit (rather, He punishes right away).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mar Brei d'Ravna):</span> If merits and sins are equal, this sin makes the sins prevail.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One should view himself as if his merits and sins weigh equally;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">40b----------------------------------------40b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he does one Mitzvah, he is now mostly a Tzadik!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he does one sin, he is mostly evil!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"One Chotei can ruin much good" - one can lose many good things due to one sin,</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon):</span> The world is judged according to its majority, and individuals are judged according to their majority.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>By doing one Mitzvah, one can make himself a Tzadik, and change the judgment of the world to merit! By doing one sin, one can make himself a Rasha, and make the world liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> Even if one was a Tzadik his whole life, if he rebels at the end he loses all his merits - "the righteousness of the Tzadik will not save him on the day of his transgression".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if one was a Rasha his whole life, if he repents at the end his sins are not mentioned - "the Rasha will not stumble in his evil on the day he repents from it."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one sins at the end, he should be considered half-meritorious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> If one regrets his merits, he is not rewarded for them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE REWARD FOR TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one who learns Mikra (written Torah) and Mishnah, and acts properly, he is not prone to sin - "a three-stranded rope is not quick to become untied";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one does not learn Mikra or Mishnah or act properly, he is uncivilized.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Elazar ben Tzadok):</span> Tzadikim in this world are compared to a tree standing in a Tahor place, and its foliage is in a Tamei place;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the foliage is cut, then it is entirely in a Tahor place.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Similarly, Hash-m brings afflictions on Tzadikim in this world, in order that they will inherit the world to come - "your beginning will be small, and your end will be very exalted."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Resha'im in this world are like a tree standing in a Tamei place, and its foliage is in a Tahor place;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the foliage is cut, then it is entirely in a Tamei place.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Similarly, Hash-m bestows good on Resha'im in this world, in order that they will descend to the lowest level - "there is a path, straight in the eyes of men, and its end are ways of death."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which is greater, Talmud Torah or doing Mitzvos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Tarfon):</span> Doing Mitzvos is greater.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Akiva):</span> Learning Torah is greater.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> Learning is greater, for learning leads one to do the Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi Yosi):</span> Learning Torah is great, for it applied (from Matan Torah), 40 years before Chalah (when Bnei Yisrael entered Eretz Yisrael), 54 years before Terumah and Ma'aser (after Bnei Yisrael conquered and apportioned Eretz Yisrael), 61 years before Shemitah, and 103 years before Yovel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should be 104 years before Yovel (since the fiftieth year is Yovel)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi Yosi holds that land returns at the beginning of the fiftieth year.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like Torah applied before other Mitzvos, also the judgment about Torah comes before judgment on other Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> "The beginning of his judgment is (for) releasing water" - one is judged first about (casting off the yoke of) Torah (which is compared to water).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Just like the judgment about Torah precedes that of other Mitzvos, also the reward for Torah - "He gave them lands... because they guard His statutes and Torah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Whoever does not learn Mikra or Mishnah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Such a person cannot be a witness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who eats in the market is like a dog;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Some say, he cannot be a witness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> The Halachah follows the latter opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Bar Kapara):</span> An angry person gains nothing from his anger. It only harms him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m gives a Tzadik a taste of the reward for his deeds;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one does not learn Mikra or Mishnah and does not behave properly, one should vow not to benefit from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"In the gathering of scoffers he did not sit" - such a person is like a scoffer.</p>
