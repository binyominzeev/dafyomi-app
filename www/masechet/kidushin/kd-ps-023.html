<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CAN A SLAVE ACQUIRE HIS FREEDOM BY HIMSELF?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> The slave was an adult. Mar Zutra was careful that the slave was serving him at the moment Rebbi Yehudah died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> The slave was a minor. Mar Zutra was careful that the slave serve him at the moment of death because he argues with Aba Sha'ul (Rashi. Tosfos - Mar Zutra was able to acquire the slave because he was a minor, and Mar Zutra holds like Aba Sha'ul. Chachamim hold that even a minor goes free, even if he was working for another.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A convert died (without heirs); his slaves, even minors, become free;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Aba Sha'ul says, only adult slaves acquire their own freedom. Minors remain slaves, and anyone can take them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> He becomes free through others giving money for him...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He cannot become free by giving money himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The slave did not authorize the redemption.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Meir holds that it is detrimental for a slave to go free (so this would not work)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Zachin l'Adam she'Lo Befanav (we may benefit one in his absence), but Ein Chavin l'Adam Ela Befanav (we may do something detrimental to him only in his presence, with his consent).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We must say that the slave agreed to be redeemed. The Mishnah teaches that the redemption can only be through others, not through himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because a slave cannot own anything. Whatever he acquires belongs to his master.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reisha):</span> He becomes free by receiving a document himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This implies that others cannot receive it for him. If he agreed to be redeemed, others could receive a document for him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Mishnah means that he become free even by himself receiving a document (and all the more so, through others);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It teaches that the slave gets a Yad (power of acquisition, which a slave lacks) at the same moment he receives his Get of freedom.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A slave can receive his own Get of freedom. Others cannot receive it for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2A (Abaye):</span> Really, the slave did not authorize his redemption;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since money can acquire a slave against his will, it can free him against his will.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should say the same about a document. Since a document can acquire him against his will, it can free him against his will!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A document of purchase (of a slave) is different than a Get of freedom, so we do not learn one from the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also money of acquisition is different than redemption money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the same coins can do either.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2B (Rava):</span> (The slave did not authorize his redemption.) When a master receives redemption money, he acts on his own behalf (and automatically, the slave goes free);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who receives a Get of freedom for a slave acts on behalf of the slave. Ein Chavin l'Adam Ela Befanav. His consent is required.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CHACHAMIM IN THE MISHNAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> He acquires his freedom through money he gives himself...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He must give the money himself. It cannot be through others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not? Even if he did not authorize it, it should work, for Chachamim hold that it is advantageous for a slave to go free!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Zachin l'Adam she'Lo Befanav, but Ein Chavin l'Adam Ela Befanav!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Chachamim mean that he acquires his freedom even through money he gives himself (as well as through others);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They teach that that a slave can acquire something (his redemption money), and it does not belong to his master.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Seifa):</span> Others can receive a Get of freedom for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He cannot receive it himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>We hold that a slave gets his Yad simultaneously with his Get (he can receive it himself. Surely, this is like Chachamim!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Mishnah means that others can also receive a Get of freedom for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the Mishnah should have taught both clauses together: a slave can become free, through money or a document, through himself or others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Mishnah teaches that he can become free through money through himself or others, or through a document only through others. 'Chachamim' in the Mishnah hold like R. Shimon ben Elazar;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> Even a document works only through others.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>There are also Chachamim (not mentioned in the Mishnah) who have a third opinion. He can become free, through money or a document, through himself or others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> R. Shimon ben Elazar learns a Gezeirah Shavah "Lah-Lah" from a married woman;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a man must put a Get in a domain he does not own (the hand of his wife, or her Shali'ach) in order to divorce her, also a master cannot put a Get of freedom in a domain he owns (the slave himself).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">23b----------------------------------------23b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> According to R. Shimon ben Elazar, can a slave make a Shali'ach to receive his Get of freedom?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Gezeirah Shavah from a married woman teaches that a slave can also make a Shali'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps a married woman can make a Shali'ach because she can receive her own Get. A slave, who cannot receive his own Get, cannot make a Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> The Gezeirah Shavah teaches that a slave can also make a Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This opposes Rav Huna Brei d'Rav Yehoshua!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna Brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Kohanim who serve in the Mikdash are Sheluchim of Hash-m;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They could not be Sheluchim of Yisrael, for one cannot appoint a Shali'ach to do something that he himself cannot do!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> According to Rabah, a slave cannot receive his own Get, but he can make a Shali'ach to receive it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The cases are different.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Yisrael cannot serve in the Mikdash at all, therefore he cannot make a Shali'ach for this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But a slave can receive a Get, so he can make a Shali'ach for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A slave can receive a Get of freedom for another slave of a different master, but not for another slave of his own master.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CAN A SLAVE OWN PROPERTY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The redemption money must belong to someone else.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue about the following. R. Meir holds that if a slave or a married woman acquires anything, it belongs to the Ba'al (master or husband);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim hold that a slave or married woman can acquire something, and it does not belong to the Ba'al.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rabah):</span> No. All agree that one acquires anything that his slave or wife acquires;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah discusses when someone told the slave 'acquire this money on condition that your master has no rights to it';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Meir holds that once he says 'acquire', the slave acquires and it belongs to the master. The Tenai 'on condition that your master has no rights to it' has no effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim say, his Tenai takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Elazar):</span> If that were the Tenai, all would agree that the slave acquires and it belongs to the master!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, they argue when he said 'acquire this money on condition that you will be redeemed through it';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Meir holds that once he says 'acquire', the slave acquires and it belongs to the master. The Tenai has no effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim say, the giver limited the acquisition. The slave acquires the money only for redemption. (The master gets it only when he frees the slave.)</p>
