<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO RECEIVES MA'AMAR AND KIDUSHIN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Ma'amar (Kidushin mid'Rabanan that a Yavam gives to his Yevamah before doing Yibum) removes a girl from her father's jurisdiction, yet a Na'arah can receive it herself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 (the text should say 'Tanya', not 'Tnan')):</span> If a minor fell to Yibum from Kidushin, a Ma'amar requires her father's consent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she is a Na'arah, it requires her consent or her father's.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (#1):</span> Rather, Rebbi Yosi bar Chanina taught that R. Yochanan explains Chachamim as follows. A girl becomes Mekudeshes only willingly, therefore only the father can receive Kidushin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She can be divorced against her will, therefore even she can receive the Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Ma'amar requires consent, yet she can receive it herself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (#1):</span> Beraisa #1 is like Rebbi, who holds that a Ma'amar works against her will.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If a Yavam gave a Ma'amar to a Yevamah against her will, he acquired her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, he did not acquire her.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rebbi learns from Yibum. Just like Yibum acquires her against her will, also Ma'amar;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim learn from Kidushin. Just like Kidushin requires her consent, also Ma'amar.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Rebbi prefers to learn matters of a Yevamah from matters of a Yevamah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>Chachamim prefer to learn from Kidushin (because Ma'amar makes Kidushin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan - Seifa of Beraisa #1):</span> (One needs consent of a Na'arah or her father to give a Ma'amar.) This is not true about Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah refutes Reish Lakish!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps Beraisa #1 is like Rebbi Yehudah, who says that two people never have jurisdiction over one person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say 'this is not true about Kidushin'? It should say, 'this is not true about divorce' (this is a bigger Chidush)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even though that is a bigger Chidush, since the Beraisa discusses Ma'amar, it mentions Kidushin, which is similar to Ma'amar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rebbi Yehudah, why is Ma'amar different than Kidushin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is different because she is already partially acquired to the Yavam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rashi - to Question (a); Tosfos Ri ha'Zaken - to Question (c)):</span> A Na'arah can receive a Ma'amar herself, because she is already partially acquired to the Yavam.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LIKE WHOM IS OUR MISHNAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A father can himself be Mekadesh his Na'arah to a man, or he can do so through a Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Reish Lakish):</span> The father can do this, but she or her Shali'ach cannot!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is like Rebbi Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa of our Mishnah, 46a):</span> If a man told a woman 'be Mekudeshes to me with this date, be Mekudeshes to me with this date... (she is Mekudeshes only if one of them is worth a Perutah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Each time, he says 'be Mekudeshes.' (If he did not, all the dates would join to a Perutah.) Like whom is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> It is like R. Shimon, who says that 'Shevu'ah, I do not owe to you, and not to you and not to you' is considered like one oath, unless he said 'Shevu'ah' to each person. (Presumably, the same Tana taught both Stam Mishnayos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah is Rebbi Yehudah. He holds like R. Shimon regarding Peratim (joining multiple oaths or acts of Kidushin to be like one).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> The rule is, if one swore a false Klal (encompassing) oath, he is liable only for one oath. If he swore a false Prat (detailed) oath, he is liable for each detail. (In Shevu'os, we define what is Klal and what is Prat.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rebbi Yehudah says, if he swore 'Shevu'ah, I do not owe you, not you, not you' - he is liable for each one;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Eliezer says, if he said 'I do not owe you, not you, not you, Shevu'ah', he is liable for each one;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>R. Shimon says, he is liable for only one oath, unless he said 'Shevu'ah' to each person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is R. Shimon. He holds like Rebbi Yehudah regarding whether a Na'arah can Mekadesh herself (to a man).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">R. Asi (to R. Zeira):</span> What happened in the Beis Medrash?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> Also I was absent. R. Avin said that everyone agreed with R. Yochanan. Reish Lakish was screaming 'the Torah equates divorce to Kidushin', but no one heeded him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">R. Asi (to R. Zeira):</span> May we rely on R. Avin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> Yes, he told me the moment he left the Beis Medrash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak:</span> I did not hear that R. Avin b'Ribi Chiya or R. Avin bar Kahana said this, rather, Stam R. Avin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must know this to ask a contradiction (if elsewhere R. Avin ruled like Reish Lakish).</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CAN A NA'ARAH MAKE A SHALI'ACH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Can a Na'arah make a Shali'ach to receive her Get?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is she like the hand of her father, or as his yard?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If she is like his hand, she can make a Shali'ach, just like he can;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If she is like his yard, she is not divorced until she receives the Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava knew this!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a man put a Get in the hand of his wife's slave, she is divorced only if the slave is asleep and she is guarding him.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why isn't she divorced if the slave is awake?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The slave is like a yard that is not under her watch.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of question 2):</span> If she is like the yard of her father, even when the Get reaches her, it should not work, for she is not under her father's watch!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, Rava knew that she is like her father's hand. He asked whether she is as strong as her father's hand to make a Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> She cannot make a Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If a minor said 'receive my Get for me', she is not divorced until it reaches her hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If a Na'arah said this, she would be divorced when the Shali'ach gets it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, she has no father (therefore, she can make a Shali'ach).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Question (Reisha) If her father told a Shali'ach to receive her Get, the husband cannot retract the Get once the Shali'ach takes it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that the Mishnah discusses a girl with a father!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated. It means as follows. If a minor said 'receive my Get for me', it does not take effect until it reaches her hand;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Na'arah said this, she is divorced when the Shali'ach gets it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is when she has no father. If she has a father, and he told a Shali'ach to receive her Get, the husband cannot retract the Get once the Shali'ach takes it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>KIDUSHIN WITHOUT THE FATHER'S KNOWLEDGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If a minor accepted Kidushin without her father's knowledge, she needs (before marrying someone else) a Get and Mi'un (a declaration that she does not desire her husband, to retroactively nullify a marriage mid'Rabanan).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Karna):</span> This is illogical!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she needs a Get (i.e. she is Mekudeshes mid'Oraisa), there is no need for Mi'un!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she needs Mi'un (she is not Mekudeshes), there is no need for a Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>They sent these opinions to Rav, but switched the names (lest Rav defend Shmuel due to his love for him). Rav ruled like Shmuel (truly) said, and was shocked that (based on what he was told) Shmuel disagreed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Shmuel's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha Brei d'Rav Ika):</span> She needs a Get, lest her father consented to the Kidushin. She needs Mi'un, lest her father did not consent to the Kidushin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If people do not realize this, they will think that she was Mekudeshes, and if Levi (who was Mekadesh her) is Mekadesh her sister, nothing happens. We require Mi'un, so that people will see that something is amiss, and will ask Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Shmuel's law applies only when there were Shiduchin (Levi had already told her father that he wants to be Mekadesh her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Ula):</span> Even Mi'un is not needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Ula say so even when there were Shiduchin?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. Ula did not comment on what Rav Nachman said.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ula):</span> If a minor became Mekudeshes without her father's knowledge, even Mi'un is not required. (Rashi - in Version #2, Ula discusses with or without Shiduchin. Tosfos - in Version #2, Ula discusses only without Shiduchin. He does not disagree with Shmuel, who discusses only with Shiduchin.) (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana - Mishnah):</span> (Reuven died without children. One of his wives (Chanah) was Ervah (a close relative forbidden) to his brother Shimon. If before Reuven died,) Chanah died, did Mi'un, was divorced, or was found to be an Ailonis (a girl who will not develop like a normal female), Shimon may do Yibum with a different widow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the case that Chanah did Mi'un, who was Mekadesh her to Reuven?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If her father did, Mi'un would not suffice. She would need a Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, she was Mekadesh herself to Reuven, and the Mishnah obligates Mi'un!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> The case is, she was like an orphan in her father's lifetime. (Previously, she was divorced or widowed from Nisu'in, after which she never returns to her father's jurisdiction. Therefore, when her father was Mekadesh her to Reuven, Mi'un suffices.)</p>
