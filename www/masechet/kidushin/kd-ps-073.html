<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHICH LINEAGES MAY INTERMARRY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rebbi Yosi's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah says "Kahal (the congregation of Hash-m, i.e. Yisrael)" five times. Three correspond to Kohanim, Leviyim, and Yisre'elim. One permits a Mamzer to marry a Shetuki (who is a doubtful Mamzer), and one permits a Shetuki to marry a Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We have no source to say that converts are part of Kehal Hash-m (who may not marry Mamzerim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rebbi Yehudah holds that one "Kahal" corresponds to Kohanim, Leviyim and Yisre'elim. He uses extra occurrences of the word to teach that converts are part of Kehal Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Alternatively, also Rebbi Yehudah uses three occurrences of Kahal for Kohanim, Leviyim, and Yisre'elim. He holds that the fourth permits a Mamzer to marry a Shetuki, and a Shetuki to marry a Yisrael (so one is free to teach that converts are part of Kehal Hash-m);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"A Mamzer will not enter (marry someone from) Kehal Hash-m" - a Vadai (definite) Mamzer may not enter the Kahal, but a Safek Mamzer may;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>A Mamzer may not marry a Vadai member of the Kahal, but he may marry a Safek member.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Alternatively, Rebbi Yehudah expounds the five occurrences of Kahal like Rebbi Yosi does;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He learns from "ha'Kahal, there will be one law for you and converts."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Rebbi Yosi argues, because "one law" separates between "Kahal" and "for you and converts".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Converts, freed slaves and Chalalim may marry a Bas Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This supports Rav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> A Bas Kohen may marry lineages (whose daughters are) disqualified from Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rav Zeira taught in Mechuza that a convert may marry a Mamzeres. He was pelted with Esrogim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> It is improper to teach this law in a city full of converts!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rava taught in Mechuza that a convert may marry a Bas Kohen. They covered him with silk.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He added that a convert may marry a Mamzeres. He lost the favor he had found in their eyes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> I help you. I give you more options whom to marry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The Halachah is, a convert is permitted to a Bas Kohen, like Rav. He is permitted to a Mamzeres, like Rebbi Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SAFEK MAMZERIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Shetuki is one who recognizes (his mother, but not his father).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Mid'Oraisa, a Shetuki is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The majority of men (possible fathers) are permitted to her (a single woman). If the father came to her (to have Bi'ah) we assume that he came from the majority;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if she went to him, so the Isur (of men forbidden to her) is considered Kavu'a (fixed), and we view it as an even Safek, the Torah says "a Mamzer will not enter Kehal Hash-m." A Vadai Mamzer may not enter the Kahal, but a Safek Mamzer may;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Mamzer may not marry a Vadai member of the Kahal, but he may marry a Safek member.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah forbid a Shetuki to marry Kosher lineages?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This is a decree, lest he marry a paternal sister.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, he should be forbidden to marry a Shetukis, lest she is his paternal sister!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We are not concerned lest every Shetuki came from the same man.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> He should not be allowed to marry a Bas Shetukis, lest she is his paternal sister!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, we are not concerned for this, it is unlikely.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, we should also not be concerned that a girl of good lineage is his sister!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> This is a stringency of lineage (we are stringent only about people of good lineage).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Mid'Oraisa, an Asufi (a deserted baby) is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (In most cases,) a married woman would not cast out her baby (even if he is a Mamzer). She would claim it is from her husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, a minority of married women cannot do so, i.e. if she is only Mekudeshes, or if her husband was surely abroad when the baby was conceived (and they would abandon a Mamzer);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, sometimes women abandon a Kosher baby, i.e. a single woman (who is ashamed that she conceived out of wedlock) or a married woman (who conceived from her husband) who cannot feed the baby!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is an even Safek. We learned that a Safek Mamzer may enter Kehal Hash-m, and a Mamzer may marry a Safek member of the Kahal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah forbid an Asufi to marry Kesheirim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This is a decree, lest he will marry a paternal sister. (We are not concerned for a maternal sister. We do not suspect lest his potential mother-in-law deserted a baby.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, he should not be allowed to marry an Asufis, lest she is his paternal or maternal sister!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We are not concerned lest all deserted babies come from the same parents.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> He should not be allowed to marry a Bas Asufi, perhaps she is his sister!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, we are not concerned for this, for it is unlikely.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, we should also not be concerned lest a girl of good lineage is his sister!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> This is a stringency of lineage.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">73b----------------------------------------73b</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN ARE WE CONCERNED FOR ASUFIM?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> If a baby was found circumcised, he is not considered an Asufi. (We assume that he has proper lineage.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>In all these cases, a baby is not considered an Asufi:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>His limbs are straightened, he was rubbed with oil, around his eyes was painted, ribbons are tied on him (to ward off illness), or a Kami'a, with writing or herbs inside (to ward off illness) hangs from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he is suspended from a date tree, he is an Asufi only if animals can reach him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he is suspended from a sorb tree, he is an Asufi only if it is close to the city (for such trees host damaging Sheidim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If he is found near a Beis ha'Keneses, if it is close to the city and many people go there, he is not an Asufi. If not, he is.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> If a baby was found in a ditch (outside the city) in which pits are thrown, he is an Asufi (Sheidim are frequent there).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If a baby was found on a raft floating in the middle of the river, he is not an Asufi (for ships will find him). If he was near the banks of the river, he is an Asufi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If he is found on the shoulder of Reshus ha'Rabim (the public thoroughfare), he is not an Asufi. If he was found in Reshus ha'Rabim, he is.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> In times of famine, he is not is considered an Asufi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which case does Rava discuss?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He was found in Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Just because his parents cannot feed him, they would want their baby to die!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He was found on the shoulder of Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, even when food is plentiful, he is not an Asufi!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Rava discusses Rav Yehudah's teaching:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Before the baby is picked up, a couple is believed to say that they are his parents. Once the baby was picked up, they are not believed to say that they are his parents.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Once he was picked up, he is called an Asufi, so they cannot permit him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> In times of famine, even after he was picked up, they are believed to say that they are his parents.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>PEOPLE WHO ARE BELIEVED ONLY RIGHT AWAY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Three are believed right away: parents, regarding an Asufi; a midwife; and a woman who (found that she is Nidah and) exempts other women. (We discussed the case of parents above.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">A midwife - (Beraisa):</span> A midwife is believed to say which of two twins was born first.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She is believed only if she never left. If she left and returned, she is not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer says, if she kept her vigil, she is believed. If not, she is not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about one who turned her face away. (She is believed only according to the first Tana.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of a woman who exempts other women?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> If three women slept in a bed, and blood was found under one of them, each is Teme'ah (Safek Nidah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one of them checked and found that she is Nidah, the others are Tehoros.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> This is only if she checked herself immediately after the blood was found.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A midwife is believed to say 'this baby is the Kohen, this is the Levi, this is the Nasin, this is the Mamzer' (e.g. they were born in the same house).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if no one protests. If someone protests, she is not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the nature of the protest?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We cannot say that one person protests, for R. Yochanan taught that protest must be from two!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, two protested.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, one person protested. R. Yochanan said that protest must be from two only when there is a previous Chazakah. Here, there is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>A storekeeper is believed to say to which person he sold.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only when the storekeeper is holding the merchandise. If not, he is not believed.</p>
