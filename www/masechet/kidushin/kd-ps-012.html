<p class="dedicationbox">KIDUSHIN 12 (21 Tishrei) - dedicated by Gedalliah Jawitz in honor of the Yahrzeit of Yehuda ben Simcha Volf Jawitz. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW MUCH IS A PERUTAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Summation of Answer #3):</span> Beis Shamai learn Kidushin from an Amah. Just like an Amah cannot be bought for a Perutah, also a wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Kidushin should be possible with a half Dinar, even with two Perutos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Once we learn that a Perutah is not enough, it follows that the Torah wants an important amount.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rava):</span> Beis Shamai admit that a Perutah is Mekadesh mid'Oraisa. Chachamim enacted that less than a Dinar does not work, lest Kidushin appear like a light matter.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW MUCH IS A PERUTAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Beis Hillel say, a Perutah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Any coin that is now considered a Perutah may be used (even if it is less than a Perutah from the days of Moshe).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> A Perutah is an eighth of an Italian Isar. (If a current Perutah is not worth this much, it cannot Mekadesh!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Mishnah refers to in Moshe's day, but nowadays, any accepted currency, no matter how small, can Mekadesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Dimi reported that R. Simai calculated the Perutah in his generation, and found it to be one eighth of an Italian Isar. Ravin reported that R. Dostai (and R. Yanai and R. Oshaya) calculated the Perutah in their generation, and found it to be one sixth of an Italian Isar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> There are more than 2000 Perutos in two Sela'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Perutah is fixed (like in Moshe's day, one part in 192 of a Dinar), there are less than 2000 Perutos in two Sela'im!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (an elder):</span> The Beraisa should say close to 2000.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There are only 1536!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it is closer to 2000 than 1000, the Tana calls it close to 2000.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> R. Simai calculated the Perutah. It was one eighth of an Italian Isar;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> R. Dostai (and... ) calculated the Perutah. It was one sixth of an Italian Isar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (Abaye):</span> You (Rav Dimi) and Ravin argue like the following Tana'im!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Perutah is an eighth of an Italian Isar. A Dinar is six Ma'ah... (a Ma'ah is four Isarim; an Isar is eight Perutos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says... (a Ma'ah is 24 Perutos. It follows that a Perutah is one sixth of an Italian Isar.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Dimi):</span> No, Ravin and I both hold like the first Tana;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When the Isar is devalued, there are 32 Isarim in a Dinar (and hence six Perutos in an Isar). When the Isar is increased, there are 24 Isarim in a Dinar (hence eight Perutos in an Isar).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>KIDUSHIN WITH ITEMS OF SMALL VALUE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If a man was Mekadesh a woman with a date, even if it sells for much less than a Perutah, we are concerned lest it is worth a Perutah in Madai (another place).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - Beis Hillel):</span> A Perutah or the value of a Perutah is Mekadesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Less than a Perutah is not Mekadesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Perutah makes Vadai (definite) Kidushin. Less than a Perutah creates Safek (doubtful) Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Levi was Mekadesh Rachel with tufts. Rav Simi bar Chiya was calculating (in front of Rav) whether it is worth a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel taught that we are concerned even if it is not worth a Perutah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If it is worth a Perutah, she is Vadai Mekudeshes. If not, she is Safek Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Reuven was Mekadesh Leah with a piece of marble. Rav Chisda was calculating whether it is worth a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel taught that even if it is not worth a Perutah, we are concerned!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Chisda argues with Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Leah's mother:</span> On the day he was Mekadesh her, it was worth a Perutah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> You are not believed (to say this, which would forbid her to his brother Shimon, who was Mekadesh her after Reuven - Tosfos).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">12b----------------------------------------12b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This is like the case of Yehudis, R. Chiya's wife. (She had painful pregnancies, and wanted to be divorced.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Yehudis (to R. Chiya):</span> My mother told me that when I was young, my father was Mekadesh me (to another man, so I am forbidden to you)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> She is not believed to forbid you to me.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rabanan (to Rav Chisda):</span> There are witnesses abroad that the rock was worth a Perutah that day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> Since they are not here, we are not concerned for them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is like R. Chanina's ruling!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> We do not forbid a woman who was captured, even if there are rumors that there are witnesses abroad (who know that she was captured. If they would testify before us, we would forbid her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye and Rava):</span> No. R. Chanina is lenient only about a captured woman, for she makes herself repulsive to the captors. (Even if the rumors were true, she probably was not defiled);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, we cannot be lenient. If the rumors are true, she is married to Reuven!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Leah married someone else. In Sura, Chachamim refused to intermarry with her children.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not because they hold like Shmuel. Rather, they hold like Abaye and Rava.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>IMPROPER KINDS OF KIDUSHIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha bar Huna):</span> If a man was Mekadesh a woman with a myrtle branch in the market, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> He is lashed, like Rav taught. She is Safek Mekudeshes to him, like Shmuel taught (perhaps it is worth a Perutah elsewhere).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav lashes for any of the following:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One who is Mekadesh through Bi'ah, or in the market (in public), or without prior arrangement;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>One who is Mevatel (invalidates) a Get (that was sent with a Shali'ach. His wife might remarry before hearing that the Get is Batel);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>One who tells witnesses that he is being coerced to divorce, and the Get he will give is invalid (people will suspect that his wife's future children are Mamzerim);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>One who is brazen to a Shali'ach of Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span>One who stays in excommunication for 30 days without coming to Beis Din to request that it be lifted;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span>One who lives in his mother-in-law's house.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is he lashed only if he lives there, but not for passing by?! Rav Sheshes lashed a man for passing by his mother-in-law's porch!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was a special case. He was suspected of Bi'ah with her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Chachamim of Neharda'a):</span> Rav lashes only one who is Mekadesh through Bi'ah without prior agreement.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Rav lashes one who is Mekadesh through Bi'ah, even with prior agreement, for this is lewd.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHAT IS CONSIDERED ACCEPTANCE OF KIDUSHIN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Shimon was Mekadesh Rachel with a myrtle mat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Onlookers:</span> It is not worth a Perutah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> She should be Mekudeshes with the four Zuzim inside.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rachel took it and was silent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Silence after the money was already given has no effect. We learn this from a Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven told Leah 'take this money for a deposit', and later he said 'be Mekudeshes to me through it':</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he said this at the time he gave it, she is Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If he said this after he gave it, if she wants, she is Mekudeshes. If she does not want, she is not Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered 'wanting' and 'not wanting'?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Wanting is saying 'yes'. Not wanting is saying 'no'.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This would imply that when he said this at the time he gave it, she is Mekudeshes even if she said no. This is absurd!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, wanting is saying 'yes'. Not wanting is being silent.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This shows that silence after the money was given has no effect.</p>
