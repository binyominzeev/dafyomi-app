<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHOSE LINEAGE DO CHILDREN FOLLOW? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Reish Lakish) Question:</span> The rule of our Mishnah (in any permitted marriage, the children follow the father) is not always true!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A convert may marry a Mamzeres, but the children are like the blemished one (the mother)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi Yosi):</span> If a convert married a Mamzeres, the children are Mamzerim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> The Mishnah is not like Rebbi Yosi, rather like Rebbi Yehudah, who forbids a convert to marry a Mamzeres.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is a forbidden marriage in which Kidushin is Tofes, so the child follows the blemished parent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't the Mishnah list this among the cases of forbidden marriages?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says 'any (forbidden marriage)' to include this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, the Mishnah is like Rebbi Yosi (who permits Mamzerim to converts). It says 'this is' to exclude cases not listed explicitly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If a Chalal married a Bas Yisrael, the marriage is permitted, and the children follow the father (and this was not listed)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Tana holds like Rebbi Yehudah ben Dosta'i, that children of a Bas Yisrael and Chalal are Kesherim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If a Yisrael married a Chalalah, the marriage is permitted, and the children follow the father (and this was not listed)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'Any permitted marriage' includes this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why wasn't it taught explicitly?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It could not be taught concisely with the other cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot say 'the daughter of a Kohen, Levi or Yisrael, or a Chalalah, who married a Kohen, Levi or Yisrael', for a Chalalah may not marry a Kohen!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why wasn't the following taught explicitly?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah citing R. Yochanan):</span> If a Mitzri Sheni (the son of a Mitzri convert) married a Mitzris Rishonah (she converted), the child is a Shlishi (and may marry a Yisrael. This shows that we follow the father.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'Any permitted marriage' includes this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rav Dimi (who says that in Rabah bar bar Chanah's case, the child is a Sheni), 'this is' excludes this case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ravin said in the name of R. Yochanan that when Nochrim of different nations marry, the children follow the father. If converts from different nations marry, the children receive the Isurim of both parents. (Since the marriage is permitted, we should follow the father!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'This is' excludes this case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Above (c), we said that the Mishnah is like Rebbi Yosi. This cannot be!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Mishnah is like Rebbi Yehudah, the Reisha says 'any permitted marriage' to include a Yisrael who married a Chalalah, and Rabah bar bar Chanah's case;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>'This is' excludes Rav Dimi's and Ravin's cases;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">67b----------------------------------------67b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The Seifa (second clause) says 'any forbidden marriage' to include a convert who married a Mamzeres;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the Mishnah is like Rebbi Yosi, granted, we can explain 'any permitted marriage' and 'this is' in the Reisha like above;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>However, what does 'any forbidden marriage' in the Seifa include?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> If the Mishnah is like Rebbi Yehudah, what does 'this is' in the Seifa exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that it does not include anything. It was taught for parallel structure;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Also according to Rebbi Yosi, 'any forbidden marriage' is just for parallel structure.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LINEAGE OF NOCHRIM AND CONVERTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin, citing R. Yochanan):</span> When Nochrim of different nations marry, the children follow the father. When converts from different nations marry, the children receive the Isurim of both parents.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does the first part mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Also from the children of the residents (of Eretz Kena'an), you may buy (slaves)" - if a Nochri (not a Kena'ani) fathered a child through a Kena'anis, we may buy the child. (He is not a Kena'ani, about whom it says "do not leave any soul alive".)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this also applies to a Kena'ani who fathered a child through a Nochris of a different nation!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Asher Holidu b'Artzechem" - we may buy from those born in our land (i.e. the mother is a Kena'anis), not from those fathered by residents of our land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> If converts from different nations marry, the children receive the Isurim of both parents.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Mitzri married an Amonis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> She has no Isur. Only male Amomin are forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, an Amoni married a Mitzris (Rishonah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the child is a boy, he is an Amomi (he and his sons may not marry into Yisrael);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the child is a girl, she is a Mitzris (Sheniyah. She may not marry into Yisrael, but her children may.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT MAKES MAMZERIM?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven cannot Mekadesh Leah, but other men can be Mekadesh her, their children are Mamzerim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> "(One who is divorced) will leave his house and be (Mekudeshes) to another man" - (Kidushin can be) to others, but not to relatives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba):</span> Perhaps this teaches only that she cannot be Mekudeshes to his son?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Another verse teaches this - "a man will not take (be Mekadesh) his father's wife"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, "another" teaches about other relatives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we need two verses for the son. One forbids marrying him l'Chatchilah, and one teaches that even b'Dieved, she is not Mekudeshes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We already know that l'Chatchilah she may not marry him from Achos Ishto (the Isur of one's wife's sister)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The punishment for Bi'ah with Achos Ishto is Kares, and one may not be Mekadesh her. All the more so, one may not be Mekadesh relatives punishable by death!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps two verses are needed for Achos Ishto. One forbids l'Chatchilah, and one teaches that even b'Dieved, she is not Mekudeshes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is correct. "Another" teaches that even b'Dieved, she is not Mekudeshes to her sister's husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for other relatives?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question (b)):</span> We learn from Achos Ishto;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The punishment for Bi'ah with Achos Ishto is Kares (for Mezid) or a Chatas (for Shogeg), and she cannot be Mekudeshes to him. Also every Ervah punishable by Kares and a Chatas cannot be Mekudeshes to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This answer works for most Arayos, but not for one's brother's wife or another man's wife!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We cannot learn to one's brother's wife, for she is permitted in a situation of Yibum, whereas Achos Ishto is never permitted for a Mitzvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We cannot learn to another man's wife, for she can be permitted (through a Get) in the life of the one who caused her to be forbidden (her husband), unlike Achos Ishto!</p>
