<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ACQUISITION OF METATELIM WITH LAND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Mishnah):</span> R. Gamliel and Chachamim were on a boat. He said 'the tithe (Ma'aser Rishon) that I will measure off later is given to R. Yehoshua, and I rent to him the area it rests on;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Another tithe (Ma'aser Oni) that I will measure off later is given to R. Akiva, to acquire it on behalf of the poor. I rent to him the area it rests on.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This shows that the Metaltelim must be on the land given!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, R. Gamliel rented the land to them so they could leave the Peros there as long as they wanted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rabah bar Yitzchak):</span> There are two cases of documents: if Reuven said 'acquire this land for Ploni and write the document', Reuven may retract his authorization to write the document, but he cannot retract the gift;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'acquire for Ploni on condition that you write the document', Reuven can retract (his authorization to write) the document and the gift.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> There is a third. A Mishnah teaches that we may write a document for the seller even if the buyer is not there. When the buyer acquires the land through Chazakah, he acquires the document, no matter where it is.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This shows that the Metaltelim need not be on the land!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps a document is a special case. It is like a handle on the land. We cannot learn to other Metaltelim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer: (Beraisa):</span> This illustrates the Mishnah 'Metaltelim is acquired with land, through money, a document, or Chazakah.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that all Metaltelim are like the document. They need not be on the land.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CONDITIONS OF THE ACQUISITION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must the giver say 'acquire Agav (along with)'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> In all the above cases, the giver did not say 'Agav'. This shows that it is not needed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Likewise, it was not recorded that he said 'acquire', but surely this is needed. Perhaps also 'Agav' is needed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Halachah is, the Metaltelim need not be on the land, but the giver must say 'Agav' and 'acquire'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can one give to Metaltelim Agav a sale of land?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> The tithe I will measure off is given to R. Yehoshua, and I rent to him the area it rests on'. (Rental is like a sale.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can one give the land to Reuven and the Metaltelim to Shimon?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> 'Another tithe that I will measure off is given to R. Akiva, to acquire it on behalf of the poor. I rent Lo (to him) the area it rests on' (even though he did not receive the tithe)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> He meant 'I rent Lo (for the Ma'aser) the area it rests on.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> We cannot learn from there. R. Akiva is like the Yad of the poor. It is as if the land was given to the recipient of the Metaltelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Agav works only if all the money was given. If only part was given, he acquires only according to what he paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> In some respects, money is a stronger acquisition than a document. In other ways, a document is stronger;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Money can redeem Hekdesh and Ma'aser Sheni, but a document cannot;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A document can divorce a married woman, but money cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>In some respects, money and documents are stronger acquisitions that Chazakah. In other ways, Chazakah is stronger.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Money and documents acquire an Eved Ivri, but Chazakah does not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chazakah is stronger than them, for one can acquire 10 fields in different places through one Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">27b----------------------------------------27b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This is only if he gave the money for all of them. If not, he acquires only according to what he gave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>This Beraisa also supports Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One who bought 10 fields in different places can acquire them all through one Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Support (of Shmuel - Rav Acha Brei d'Rav Ika):</span> If one hands over 10 animals in one leash, they are all acquired.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That case is different, for they are all in the hands of the receiver. This does not apply to land!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question (against Shmuel - Rav Acha Brei d'Rav Ika):</span> If one hands over 10 animals in one leash and said 'acquire this one ', only one is acquired!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That case is different, for they are distinct animals. All land is connected!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE GILGUL OATH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who must swear about Metaltelim...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> We learn an oath of Gilgul (that once one must swear, he can be forced to swear about additional things) from Sotah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The repetition "she will answer 'Amen, Amen'" teaches that she accepts the curse and the oath. She swears that she was not Mezanah with this man or any other man, that she was not Mezanah during Erusin or Nisu'in, not while a Shomeres Yavam or after Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of during Erusin?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He warned her during Erusin, and now she is still an Arusah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> A (Sotah who is an) Arusah or a Shomeres Yavam does not drink and does not get a Kesuvah, for it says "Tachas (while living with) your husband."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, he warned her during Erusin and she drinks after Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, the water would not test her (for seclusion during Erusin).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"(Her husband) will be clean from sin" - the water only tests her if he is clean from sin (and he is not, for he had Chupah with her after she was secluded)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he warned her during Nisu'in. He makes her swear about Erusin through Gilgul.</p>
