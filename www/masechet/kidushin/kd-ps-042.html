<p class="dedicationbox">KIDUSHIN 42 (14 Nisan) - dedicated by Mr. D. Kornfeld l'Iluy Nishmas his grandmother, Chayah bas Aryeh Leib Shpira (nee Sole), on the day of her Yahrzeit. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE SOURCE FOR SHELICHUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yonasan learns unlike R. Yehoshua ben Korchah above. What is his source for Shelichus regarding Kodshim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yonasan) Question:</span> Why does it say "all of Yisrael will slaughter (the Korban Pesach)"? Only one person slaughters it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, this teaches that all of Yisrael can be partners in one Korban Pesach (even though everyone owns less than an olive's volume).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This itself shows that Shelichus works for Kodshim! The answer to question (a) is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This shows that Shelichus works only when the Shali'ach is a partner (he acts also for himself).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Each man will take a lamb for his household".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps there also, Shelichus works only because the Shali'ach is a partner!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the previous verse teaches that a partner can be a Shali'ach, this verse teaches that even one who is not a partner can be a Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need the latter verse for R. Yitzchak's law!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> A man can acquire on behalf of others, but a minor cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn R. Yitzchak's law from "(you will appoint on the lamb) a man according to his eating".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need this last verse to teach that we may slaughter a Korban Pesach for an individual (to eat it all himself)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yonasan holds that we do not slaughter for an individual (lest he not be able to finish it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal):</span> "One Nasi (for each Shevet will acquire a portion of Eretz Yisrael for his Shevet)" this teaches that a Shali'ach can act on behalf of others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need the other verses for Shelichus?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> The Nesi'im could not have been Sheluchim. They acquired also on behalf of minors, who cannot make Sheluchim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rava bar Rav Huna citing Rav Gidal):</span> Rather, "one Nasi" teaches that Reuven can acquire to benefit Shimon, even when Shimon is not here.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be! The acquisition of shares of Eretz Yisrael was not beneficial for everyone. Some people prefer land in the valley, and others prefer in the mountain!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rava bar Rav Huna citing Rav Gidal):</span> Rather, "one Nasi" teaches that if orphans come to divide their inheritance, Beis Din appoints a guardian for them for their benefit and detriment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why should we appoint someone for their detriment?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means that the guardian is empowered to do things that may have a detrimental result, if their intention is to benefit the orphans.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN A DIVISION IS INVALID</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> If orphans come to divide their father's property, Beis Din appoints a guardian for them and select a nice portion for them. When the orphans grow up, they can demand a new division;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman himself):</span> They cannot demand a new division. If they could, Beis Din would be weak!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Elsewhere Rav Nachman is not concerned for the power of Beis Din!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Beis Din assessed property (to sell to feed orphans or a widow) for a sixth more or less than the actual value, the sale is void;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, the sale stands. If it were void, Beis Din would be weak!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">42b----------------------------------------42b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Nachman is concerned for the power of Beis Din only when they did not err.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they did not err, why can the orphans protest (according to Shmuel)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (They did not err about the value.) They erred about location. (E.g. an orphan received a portion far from property that he inherited from his mother's father.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If brothers divided an inheritance and erred, i.e. some brothers received too much and others too little, the law is like that of buyers. If the mistake was less than a sixth of the value, the sale (division) stands;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the mistake was more than a sixth, the sale is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the mistake was exactly a sixth, the sale is valid, but whoever got too little is compensated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rav Nachman's laws apply only in the following situations:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When the mistake was less than a sixth of the value, the sale stands. This is when they acted for themselves;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If a Shali'ach acted for them, the sale is invalid. The Shali'ach was appointed only to help them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> If the mistake was more than a sixth, the sale is invalid. This is when they did not say 'let us divide like Beis Din.' If they said this, the division stands (like R. Shimon ben Gamliel);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Beis Din appraised property (and sold it) and erred, a sixth above or below the true value, the sale is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, the sale stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If the mistake was exactly a sixth, the sale is valid, but there is compensation. This refers only to Metaltelim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The law of Ona'ah (compensating one who received too little) does not apply to land.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Ona'ah does not apply to land only when they erred about the value. There is compensation for a mistake in measurement of any size.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> If the mistake was exactly a sixth, the sale is valid, but there is compensation. This is when they did not say 'let us divide like Beis Din.' If they said this, the division is void (like Chachamim);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Beis Din appraised property (and sold it) and erred, a sixth above or below the true value, the sale is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, the sale stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>If the mistake was more than a sixth, the sale is invalid. This applies only to Metaltelim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Ona'ah does not apply to land (to invalidate the sale);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Ona'ah does not apply to land when they erred about the value. Even a small mistake in measurement invalidates the sale.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A SHALI'ACH TO TRANSGRESS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sent a Cheresh (deaf-mute), lunatic or minor with a fire, and they cause damage, the sender is exempt b'Yedei Adam (Beis Din cannot make him pay), but he is liable b'Yedei Shamayim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he sent a proper adult, the adult is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we attribute the Shali'ach's action to the sender?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not say so about a Shali'ach to transgress. The Shali'ach should have obeyed Hash-m, not the one who sent him! (His authorization was invalid.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven sent Shimon to buy something, and he gave to him Hekdesh money, if Shimon deviated from his mission, he transgressed Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he fulfilled his mission, Reuven transgressed Me'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Reuven transgress through his Shali'ach? We should say that the Shelichus is invalid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Me'ilah is an exception. We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Chet-Chet" from Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like one can make a Shali'ach for Terumah, also for Me'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we learn from Me'ilah to other Aveiros?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Me'ilah and Shelichus Yad (unauthorized use of a deposit) are Shnei Kesuvim, therefore, we do not learn to other cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> "For any Devar (matter of) transgression" obligates a Shomer (to pay for any loss to the deposit) if he intended to be Shole'ach Yad.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel say, he is not liable until he uses it - "if he was not Shole'ach Yad (he may swear to exempt himself)".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Beis Shamai:</span> How do you expound "for any Davar of transgression"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Beis Hillel:</span> One might have thought that the watchman is liable only if he himself used the deposit. "For any Davar" teaches that even if he told his slave or Shali'ach to use it, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This answer is according to Beis Hillel. Why don't Beis Shamai learn to other sins?</p>
