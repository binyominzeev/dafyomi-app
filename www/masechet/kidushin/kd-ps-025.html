<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE EVER AND BEITZIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rav Chisda told Rav Hamnuna to rebuke (Rashi  - excommunicate) the elders of Nizunya for not coming to his Derashah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Hamnuna:</span> Why don't you come?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The elders:</span> He does not answer our questions!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Hamnuna:</span> Did you ask me something that I could not answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question (the elders):</span> If a master castrated his slave through the Beitzim (testicles), does the slave go free?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Rav Hamnuna could not answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> Rebbi and Chachamim argue about this:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are 24 extremal limbs on which one cannot contract Tzara'as (because they are not flat, the Kohen cannot see the entire afflicted area at once): the ends of the fingers, toes, ears, nose and Ever, and a women's breasts;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Rebbi Yehudah includes also a man's nipples.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a master destroyed any of these (of his slave), the slave goes free;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>Rebbi says, even if he castrated him, the slave goes free.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span>Ben Azai says, he even goes free for loss of the tongue.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span>Rebbi cannot mean castration of the Ever, since that was already listed! Rather, he means castration of the Beitzim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This Beraisa implies that Rebbi holds that he does not go free for loss of his tongue;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If one needed to be sprinkled with water sanctified with ashes of the red heifer, and the water landed on his mouth, the sprinkling is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> 'His mouth' refers to his tongue. (This shows that it is considered external. If so, a slave should go free for it!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it refers to his lips.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously, sprinkling on the lips is valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that since the lips are sometimes closed, they are not considered exposed, and the sprinkling is invalid. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> A Beraisa explicitly (says that Rebbi) is Machshir sprinkling on the tongue!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Beraisa):</span> If most of the tongue was removed, this is a blemish (because it is an external organ);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rebbi says, if most of the Medaber (the part that is not stuck down) was removed (it is a Mum).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, Rebbi says that a slave goes free if he was castrated, all the more so for loss of his tongue. Ben Azai says that he goes free for the tongue, but not for castration.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Ben Azai's words should precede Rebbi's in the Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana first heard Rebbi's opinion, and taught it. Later, he heard Ben Azai's opinion, but he did not want to alter his teaching, so he left Rebbi's words in their place.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHICH PARTS OF THE MOUTH ARE CONSIDERED EXTERNAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> All agree that the tongue is considered external regarding Tum'ah of a Sheretz (rodent). It says "that will touch it", and the tongue can be touched.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>All agree that it is considered internal regarding immersion. It says "he will wash his flesh in water." He must immerse only what is external, like his flesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>They only argue about sprinkling;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi equates it to Tum'ah, and Chachamim equate it to immersion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>They argue about "the Tahor will sprinkle on the Tamei... (and be Metaher him)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi explains that "sprinkling on (a part of the body from which he could become) Tamei... will be Metaher him";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim expound "he will be Metaher him (by sprinkling on a place that)... he will immerse his clothes and immerse himself".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim hold that it is better to learn Taharah (through sprinkling) from Taharah (through immersion), and not from Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Rebbi does not learn like Chachamim, for the Torah interrupted ("he will immersing his clothes") in between.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Rebbi really hold that the tongue need not be immersed (because it is internal)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> A Shifchah of Rebbi's house once found a bone between her teeth after immersing. Rebbi made her immerse again. (He is concerned for inside the mouth!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Water need not enter the inside of the mouth, but it must be fitting for immersion, like R. Zeira's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> Any (flour-offering) that is small enough that it could be mixed (with the proscribed amount of oil in the Kli), even if it was not kneaded, it is Kosher;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is so large that it could not be kneaded, it is invalid because it was not kneaded.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">25b----------------------------------------25b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Tana'im argue about the Beitzim (whether or not they are considered exposed).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi Yehudah):</span> "Mashed, crushed, uprooted or cut" applies to the Beitzim (such a man is a Petzu'a Daka);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do they apply only to the Beitzim, but not to the Ever?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, they apply even to the Beitzim (and surely to the Ever as well).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, they apply (only) to the Ever;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rebbi Yosi says, "mashed or crushed" applies even to the Beitzim. "Uprooted or cut" applies only to the Ever.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ACQUISITIONS OF ANIMALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir and R. Eliezer):</span> A large (i.e. work) animal may be acquired through Mesirah (handing over). A small animal is acquired through Hagbahah (lifting);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, a small animal is acquired through Meshichah (taking to one's premises).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav):</span> A large animal is acquired through Meshichah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah says that it is acquired through Mesirah. Also Rav used to say so!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav retracted, and holds like the following Tana:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Chachamim say, either type of animal is acquired through Meshichah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, both are acquired (only) through Hagbahah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> According to R. Shimon, how does one acquire an elephant?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> One acquires through Chalipin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> He rents the place it is standing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Zeira):</span> He puts Kelim under its feet.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that the Kelim of the buyer can acquire for him in the premises of the seller!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, his answer applies to a Simta (a shoulder of the public thoroughfare).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Zeira):</span> He lifts gets the elephant using bundles of branches. (Rashi - it steps on them; Tosfos - he throws them, and the elephant jumps to catch them.)</p>
