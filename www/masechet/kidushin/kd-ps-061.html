<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HEKDESH OF A FIELD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was Makdish his field at a period when Yovel applies, to redeem it, he gives 50 Shekalim for a field large enough to sow a Chomer of barley seed (a Beis Kor).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there are ditches 10 Tefachim deep, or rocks 10 Tefachim tall, they are not measured with the rest of the field. If they are less than 10 Tefachim, they are measured with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, the slopes of the ditches are not Hekdesh (to be subject to the fixed redemption rates of fields, rather, according to their actual value), but the bottom of the ditches should be Hekdesh like fields!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Since the bottoms do not add up to a full Beis Kor, they are not Hekdesh as fields.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa) Question:</span> "A field (on which is sown) a Chomer of barley" is redeemed for 50. What is the source that a smaller field is redeemed proportionally at this rate?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "A field" refers to a field of any size.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar Ukva bar Chama):</span> The case is, the ditches are full of water. They cannot be seeded.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> The Beraisa teaches them together with tall rocks, which cannot be seeded.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they are full of water, even if they are less than 10 Tefachim, they should not be considered part of the field!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shallow ditches, even if they are full of water, are like basins of the field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven said 'I sell to you a Beis Kor or earth', if there are ditches 10 Tefachim deep, or rocks 10 Tefachim tall, they are not measured like part of the field. If they are less than 10 Tefachim, they are measured with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Ukva bar Chama):</span> This is even if the ditches are not full of water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> One does not want to pay money for a field he cannot farm at once.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the law regarding Kidushin (if one was Mekadesh Al Menas that he has a Beis Kor, do dry ditches count towards the Beis Kor)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we compare it to Hekdesh, or to a sale?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Presumably, it is like Hekdesh. He can tell her 'I will need to work harder to farm it (it does not matter to you).'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>VALID TANAYIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Any Tenai that is not (Kaful, i.e. discusses both possibilities) like the Tenai made with the tribes of Gad and Reuven is invalid. "If they will cross the Yarden... if they will not cross to fight..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Chanina ben Gamliel says, the verse does not teach this (it is not extra). There was a need to stipulate that if they do not cross, they will inherit (like other tribes) in Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> R. Chanina ben Gamliel refuted R. Meir!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir can counter, it would have sufficed to write 'if they do not cross, they will inherit amidst you';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"In Eretz Kena'an" is extra, to teach that Tanayim must be Kaful.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">61b----------------------------------------61b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Chanina holds that had it not written "in Eretz Kena'an", one might have thought that they will inherit among Bnei Yisrael in Gil'ad (Ever ha'Yarden), but not in Eretz Kena'an.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Meir holds that "amidst you" connotes everywhere that you inherit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Chanina ben Gamliel):</span> A parable for this is a man who divided his property to his sons. He said 'Reuven will receive field A, Shimon receives field B, and Levi will give 200 Zuz and receive field C. If he will not give, he will inherit with his brothers in the other fields.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He inherits in the other fields (if he does not pay) only due to the Kefel ('if he will not give...')!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The parable is unlike our Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Mishnah, without the Kefel, they would (be fined and) not receive in either place. In the parable, even without the Kefel, Levi would receive a share of everything except the first two fields!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the Mishnah, R. Chanina thought that R. Meir considers the entire phrase to be extra, and disagreed (for without it, Bnei Gad would not get anything). After he heard that R. Meir meant that the Torah could have said only "v'Ne'echezu Besochechem", he gave a parable (in the Beraisa) to show why also "b'Eretz Kena'an" was needed (for the 'other property', Eretz Yisrael proper).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MUST BOTH SIDES BE EXPRESSED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (R. Meir holds that we may not infer the negative from the positive.) According to R. Meir, we understand why Hash-m told Kayin "if you will improve, you will rise. If you will not improve, sin crouches at the opening";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Chanina, why is the Kefel needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that if you will improve, you will be rewarded. If you will not improve, there will be neither reward nor punishment. The Kefel teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Meir, we understand "then you (Eliezer) will be exempt from my oath (if they do not consent to send the girl for Yitzchak)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Chanina, why was the Kefel needed? (Just like we may infer the negative from the positive, we may infer that in this case he is exempt from the oath!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that if she wants to come, but her family objects, he should bring her against their will. The Kefel teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was it needed to say "if she will not want to come"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that if her family wants to give her, but she objects, he should bring her against her will. 'If she will not want to come' teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Meir, we understand "if you will go in My statutes... ", "and if you will despise My statutes...";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Chanina, why did the Torah need to write the Kefel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that if you will go in My statutes, you will receive a Berachah, and if you will despise My statutes, there will be neither a Berachah nor a curse. The Kefel teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Meir, we understand "if you will desire, and listen... ", "and if you will refuse, and rebel...";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Chanina, why did the verse need to write the Kefel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that if you will desire, it will be good, and if you refuse, neither good nor bad will result. The Kefel teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "you will eat sword"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refers to hard salt, hard barley bread, and onions;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Unseasoned bread with salt and onions harm the body as swords.</p>
<p class="bas normal"></p>
