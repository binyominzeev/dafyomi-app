<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ENTERING ERETZ YISRAEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that "Moshav" connotes 'wherever you dwell', we understand "they (Yisrael, who entered Eretz Yisrael with Yehoshua) ate from the Peros of the land on the day after Pesach";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since Chadash applied right away, they could eat only after bringing the Omer on the second day of Pesach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to the opinion that "Moshav" connotes after inheriting and apportioning, they should have eaten right after entering!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There was no need to eat the land's Peros until the manna ceased.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Bnei Yisrael ate manna 40 years, until they came to a settled land."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> "They ate until they came to the border of Eretz Kena'an."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Moshe died on Adar 7, and the manna ceased to fall. What they gathered into their Kelim lasted until Nisan 16.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> Why does it say "Bnei Yisrael ate manna 40 years"? It was one month less than this! (It first fell on Iyar 16.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The doughs that they took with them from Mitzrayim (which lasted from Nisan 15 until Iyar 15) had the taste of manna.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Moshe was born and died on Adar 7.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that he died that day?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Bnei Yisrael cried over Moshe for 30 days." After this, it says "in three more days you will cross..." and "they alighted from the Jordan River on Nisan 10."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Adar 7 is 33 days before Nisan 10.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source he was born that day?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer - Question:</span> Why does it say "I am 120 years old today"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that Hash-m fulfills the years of Tzadikim to the day and month - "the number of your days I will fulfill."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MITZVOS DEPENDENT ON LAND THAT APPLY IN CHUTZ LA'ARETZ</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> When Yisrael entered Eretz Yisrael, they were commanded three Mitzvos that apply also in Chutz La'Aretz (Chadash, Orlah and Kil'ei ha'Kerem, i.e. forbidden crossbreed in a vineyard. "Moshav" teaches that Chadash applies in Chutz La'Aretz. A Kal va'Chomer teaches that the others do, also.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chadash is not a permanent Isur (it never extends past Nisan 16), it does not forbid benefit (only eating), the Isur can be lifted (on Nisan 16, when the Omer is brought), yet it applies even in Chutz La'Aretz;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Kilayim is a permanent Isur, it forbids benefit, and the Isur cannot be lifted. All the more so, it applies even in Chutz La'Aretz!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Two of these stringencies (Rashi - it forbids benefit and the Isur cannot be lifted; Tosfos - it is a permanent Isur and it forbids benefit) apply to Orlah, so the Kal va'Chomer applies to Orlah, too.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon says, every Mitzvah that Yisrael were commanded before entering the land applies in Chutz La'Aretz as well. Every Mitzvah they were commanded after entering the land applies only in Eretz Yisrael, except for Shemitah of money and sending slaves free.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">38b----------------------------------------38b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though they were commanded these two after entering, they apply also in Chutz La'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shemitah of money does not depend on the land! (Rashi - so Yisrael were commanded before we entered the land; Tosfos - therefore, surely it applies in Chutz La'Aretz as well!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought it applies only in Eretz Yisrael because it is equated to Shemitah of land (Rashi - the Isur to work the land; Tosfos - returning sold land to the original owner, in Yovel).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "Shemitah... Shemot" discusses two Shemitos, of money and land. Shemitah of money applies only when Shemitah of land applies.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Shemitah of money applies only where Shemitah of land applies (in Eretz Yisrael)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "You will declare Shemitah to Hash-m" - everywhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Freedom of slaves does not depend on the land. Why did the Beraisa need to teach that it applies in Chutz La'Aretz?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it says "you will declare freedom in the land", one might have thought it applies only in Eretz Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"It is Yovel" teaches that freedom applies everywhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say "you will declare freedom in the land"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Freedom applies in Chutz La'Aretz only when it applies in Eretz Yisrael (but not when Yisrael were in the Midbar, or after they were exiled).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ORLAH AND KILAYIM OF CHUTZ LA'ARETZ</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chadash is forbidden mid'Oraisa even in Chutz La'Aretz. A Halachah forbids Orlah (in Chutz La'Aretz). Kilayim is forbidden mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What kind of Halachah forbids Orlah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is Hilchos (ways) of the land. (Yisre'elim adopted the practice, and it became obligatory.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ula):</span> It is a Halachah that Moshe received on Sinai (nit to written in the Torah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Ula:</span> According to me, we understand why Safek Orlah is unlike Safek Kilayim (in Chutz La'Aretz, for Orlah is mid'Oraisa, but Kilayim is not);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Safek Orlah in Eretz Yisrael is forbidden. In Surya (lands that David conquered and annexed to Yisrael) it is permitted (if it was already picked). In Chutz La'Aretz, one may even ask the seller to pick (from an orchard with Orlah and permitted trees), as long as you don't see him pick Orlah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If vegetables are sold outside a vineyard in which vegetables are growing (what grows there is forbidden), in Eretz Yisrael, one may not buy them. In Surya one may buy (perhaps the vegetables are from elsewhere). In Chutz La'Aretz, one may buy Vadai (definite) Kilayim, as long as he does not pick it himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ula):</span> According to Rav Yehudah, both are mid'Rabanan. Why are the laws different?</p>
