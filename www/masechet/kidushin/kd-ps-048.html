<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>KIDUSHIN WITH A LOAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> R. Meir and his Chachamim all hold like Rav Papa. They argue about Shmuel's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If a lender sold his loan document, and then pardoned the borrower from paying the debt, the debt is cancelled. Even the lender's heir may cancel the debt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim hold like Shmuel (she does not resolve to accept Kidushin, due to concern lest he pardon the debt). R. Meir does not hold like Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> R. Meir and his Chachamim all hold like Shmuel. They argue about the psychology of women;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir holds that a woman resolves to accept a document. She is not worried lest her husband pardon the debt and prevent her from collecting;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim holds that she does not accept a document. She is worried lest he pardon the debt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding a Milveh Al Peh, what do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about Rav Huna's law:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If Reuven has money of Shimon, and Shimon says in front of Reuven and Levi 'give the money to Levi', Levi immediately acquires the money. (In Beraisa #1, Shimon told Reuven in front of Leah 'give the money I lent to you to Leah, to be Mekadesh her to me'.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim hold that Rav Huna's law applies only to deposits, but not to loans;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Meir holds that it applies even to loans.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about Kidushin with a loan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If one said 'be Mekudeshes to me with this document', she is not Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Elazar says, she is Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, we evaluate the paper. If it is worth a Perutah, she is Mekudeshes. (If not, she is not - Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak (below) held that these words are not in the Beraisa.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What kind of document is it?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is a loan document that others owe to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Meir holds that she is Mekudeshes through such a document!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is a document for a loan that she owes to him. The Tana'im argue about whether or not a loan can make Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> No, he gave her a Shtar Kidushin without witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir holds that a document must be signed by witnesses to be valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Elazar holds that a document (even without signatures) given in front of witnesses is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim are unsure whether the Halachah follows R. Meir or R. Elazar;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We evaluate the document. If it is worth a Perutah, she is Vadai Mekudeshes. If not, she is Safek Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> He gave her a Shtar Kidushin that was not written Lishmah (for her). The Tana'im argue about Reish Lakish's law:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> If a Shtar Kidushin was not written Lishmah, is it valid?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Do we equate Kidushin to divorce? Just like a Get must be Lishmah, also a Shtar Kidushin;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, do we equate all methods of Kidushin? Just like Kidushin money need not be (minted) Lishmah, also a Shtar Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> We equate Kidushin to divorce. It must be Lishmah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #3:</span> All the Tana'im hold like Reish Lakish. He gave her a Shtar Kidushin that was written Lishmah without consulting her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Tana'im argue like Rava and Rav Papa argued.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Such a document is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> It is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>KIDUSHIN THROUGH WAGES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The following Tana'im argue about whether or not a loan can make Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If one said 'make this metal into chains and rings for me, and I will be Mekudeshes to you', once he makes them, she is Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, she is Mekudeshes only when she gets money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What money do they refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is the jewelry she requested.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Meir cannot say she is Mekudeshes before she gets it. He gave her nothing!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, they refer to additional money. The Tana'im argue about whether or not a loan (what she owes him for his labor) can be Mekadesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Both Tana'im hold that wages are accrued continuously, from the start of the job until the end, so they are like a loan that she owes to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Meir holds that a loan cannot Mekadesh, Chachamim say that it can.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> No, all agree that a loan cannot Mekadesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about whether or not wages are accrued continuously.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">48b----------------------------------------48b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir considers it as if all the work is done at the moment it is completed (he gives her new money, not a loan);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim hold that wages are owed (at each moment, based on how much has been completed) from the start of the job until the end, so it is like a loan that she owes to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> All agree that wages accrue from the start until the end, and a loan cannot be Mekadesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about whether a worker acquires improvements to a Kli (on which he is working, through the wages due to him).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir holds that he acquires. (The wages are not like a loan. Rather, it is as if he sells the Kli when he finishes.) Chachamim disagree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #3:</span> All agree that a worker does not acquire improvements to a Kli, and that wages accrue from the start until the end, and that a loan cannot be Mekadesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is, he added to what she gave to him, and also pardoned her debt to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Meir holds that she intends to become Mekudeshes through his addition (which is worth at least a Perutah);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim say, she intends to become Mekudeshes through the loan, and this does not work.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>They argue like the following Tana'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one was Mekadesh 'with the wages for the work I did for you', she is not Mekudeshes. If he said 'with the wages for the work I will do for you', she is Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Nasan says, if he said 'with the wages for the work I will do for you', she is not Mekudeshes, all the more so if he said 'with wages for the work I did for you'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rebbi says, in either case, she is not Mekudeshes. If he added something of his own, she is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The first Tana and R. Nasan argue about wages. The first Tana holds that they accrue from the start until the end. R. Nasan holds that they are due only at the end;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Nasan and Rebbi argue about Kidushin with a Perutah and a loan. R. Nasan holds that she intends to become Mekudeshes through the loan (which is invalid). Rebbi holds that she intends to become Mekudeshes through the Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MISTAKEN KIDUSHIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'be Mekudeshes to me with this cup of wine', and it was found to be honey, or vice-versa (he said honey, and it was wine), she is not Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said 'with this silver Dinar', and it was found to be gold, or vice-versa, she is not Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he said 'on condition that I am poor', and he was found to be rich, or vice-versa, she is not Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon says, if he tricked her l'Shevach (he gave to her something worth more than what he said), she is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa #1):</span> If one said 'be Mekudeshes to me with this cup' he is Mekadesh with the cup and its contents;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> He means only the cup, but not its contents;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #3):</span> He means only the contents, but not the cup.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The Beraisos do not argue. Beraisa #2 discusses a cup of water, Beraisa #3 discusses a cup of wine, and Beraisa #1 discusses a cup of oil (Rashi; Tosfos - in Beraisa #1 the cup holds water, in Beraisa #2 it holds wine, and in Beraisa #3 it holds oil.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> If he tricked her l'Shevach, she is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Shimon argue with the following Mishnah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the seller said that he is selling wine, and it was found to be vinegar, or vice-versa - either party can retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is because some people prefer wine, some prefer vinegar. Here also, some people prefer gold, some prefer silver!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> (He does not argue.) In our Mishnah, Reuven told Shimon 'lend to me a silver Dinar, and be Mekadesh Leah to me with it'. Shimon decided to lend and be Mekadesh with a gold Dinar (without telling Reuven).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim hold that Reuven was insistent that he give a silver Dinar (so the Kidushin is invalid). R. Shimon holds that Reuven merely suggested (that even silver suffices, and all the more so gold).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> If so, the Mishnah should say 'be Mekudeshes to him', not 'be Mekudeshes to me'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> If so, it should say 'if he tricked him', not 'if he tricked her'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection #3:</span> If so, it should not say 'it was found to b', since he openly gave her gold!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava and R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> The case is, Leah told a Shali'ach 'go receive my Kidushin from Reuven, who said that he will be Mekadesh me with a silver Dinar', and Reuven gave a gold Dinar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say that Leah was insistent to receive a silver Dinar. R. Shimon says, Leah merely suggested (that even silver is fine, and all the more so gold).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say 'it was found to be gold'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When Reuven gave the money to the Shali'ach, it was wrapped up, and he did not see that it was gold. (The Beis Meir questions why the Tana did not discuss openly giving gold.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> R. Shimon, R. Shimon ben Gamliel and R. Eliezer all hold that one (sometimes) is not insistent that his words be fulfilled exactly, rather he makes a suggestion.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon says so in our Mishnah. R. Shimon ben Gamliel says so in the following Mishnah.</p>
