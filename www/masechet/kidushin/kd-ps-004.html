<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE FATHER RECEIVES KIDUSHIN MONEY (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> These departures are not similar!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An Amah totally leaves her master's jurisdiction. A girl who becomes Mekudeshes does not totally leave her father's jurisdiction until Chupah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding vows she is no longer in her father's jurisdiction (he can no longer annul her vows by himself);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The father and husband jointly annul the vows of a Na'arah Me'orasah (during Erusin, after Kidushin and before Nisu'in).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need "v'Yatz'ah Chinam Ein Kasef" for a different teaching!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Yatz'ah Chinam" teaches that she goes free when she becomes a Bogeres. "Ein Kasef " teaches that she goes free when she becomes a Na'arah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> If the verse came to teach only one of these, it would have said "An Kesef". Rather, it says "Ein Kesef" to teach both teachings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to expound the Yud (i.e. that it says Ein, not An)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> "V'Zera Ein Lah" (if a Bas Kohen married to a Yisrael was widowed without children, she may eat Terumah again) - perhaps only children from a Yisrael forbid her from eating Terumah again, but (if the children died,) grandchildren do not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (We read "Ein Lah" like) 'Ayen Lah' (investigate her. Even grandchildren forbid.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps only legitimate descendants from a Yisrael forbid her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> 'Ayen Lah' (even Mamzerim prevent her).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We expounded this to teach that grandchildren forbid her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, a verse is not needed for grandchildren, for they are like children. The verse is needed only for Mamzerim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Tana's source to expound the Yud this way?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Sometimes the Torah omits the Yud, e.g. "Me'en Bilam" and "Me'en Yabmi". Since there is a Yud here, we expound it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The Torah needed to teach that her father gets her Kidushin money, and also her earnings;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only that he keeps the Kidushin money, one might have thought that this is because she did not work to get the money;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>She would keep her own earnings, for which she toiled;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only that he keeps her earnings, one might have thought that this is because he continuously feeds her (and expects frequent compensation);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>She would keep her Kidushin money, for her father does not think about this when feeding her.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>GOING FREE AT NA'ARUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "She goes out for free" teaches that she goes free when she becomes a Bogeres (six months after becoming a Na'arah). "There is no money" teaches that she goes free when she becomes a Na'arah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Torah says that she goes free upon becoming a Na'arah, it need not say that she goes free when she becomes a Bogeres!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> Both of these are needed, just like in the following case:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Toshav (a resident)" refers to one (a Nirtza, whose ear was bored through) who serves forever (until Yovel. He may not eat Terumah, even if he is a Kohen's slave.) "Sachir (a hired worker may not eat Terumah)" refers to a (Yisrael) slave who serves for six years.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah forbids even a permanent slave to eat Terumah. Why must it teach that a temporary slave may not eat?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the Torah taught only that a Toshav not eat, one would have thought that Toshav refers to a temporary slave, but a permanent slave (of a Kohen) eats Terumah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It wrote also "Sachir", to teach that "Toshav" refers to a permanent slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> There is different! Had the Torah written only "Toshav", we would say that a Nirtza does not eat. It also wrote that a Sachir (six-year) slave does not eat, even though this could have been learned from a Kal va'Chomer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, there is only one person. If she leaves at Na'arus, she is not with the master at Bagrus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> "There is no money" teaches that an Ailonis (a girl who does not develop like a normal female) goes free at Bagrus (she becomes a Bogeres when she brings certain Simanim (signs). She is never a Na'arah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that a (regular) girl goes free at Na'arus, but (an Ailonis) does not go free at Bagrus. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches that an Ailonis goes free at Bagrus!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When a girl becomes a Na'arah, she does not leave her father's jurisdiction, but she leaves her master. Bagrus takes her from her father's jurisdiction, all the more so it frees her from her master!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> The words teach that the sale of an Ailonis is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that only a girl who can go free through signs of Na'arus can be sold. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">4b----------------------------------------4b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Mar bar Rav Ashi not agree that the Torah sometimes teaches a law that could have been derived from a Kal va'Chomer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We say so only when we cannot derive a new law. If we can derive a new law, we do so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT MAKES KIDUSHIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "When a man will take (be Mekadesh) a woman and have Bi'ah with her" - he takes her through money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We find that acquisition through money is called Kichah (taking) - "I gave the money for the field, take it from me".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach this! An Amah cannot be acquired through Bi'ah, but she can be acquired through money. A woman can be Mekudeshes through Bi'ah, all the more so, she can be Mekudeshes through money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> A Yevamah disproves the Kal va'Chomer, for she can be acquired through Bi'ah, but not through money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A woman can be Mekudeshes through a document, unlike a Yevamah. Likewise, we can say that a woman can be Mekudeshes through money, unlike a Yevamah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"When a man will take a wife" teaches that she may be Mekudeshes through money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We defended the Kal va'Chomer. Why must we learn from the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> One can uproot the Kal va'Chomer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learned that if an Amah can be acquired through money, all the more so money makes Kidushin. We can say that money acquires an Amah because an Amah goes free through money (but money cannot undo Kidushin)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Therefore, a verse was needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The Torah needed to write both "she goes out for free" and "when a man will take a wife".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it written only the latter verse, one might have thought that she keeps the Kidushin money. Therefore, we need "she goes out for free";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it written only "she goes out for free", one might have thought that if a woman gives a man money and is Mekadesh him, it works. Therefore, we need "when a man will take a wife".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>"And he has Bi'ah with her" teaches that a woman can be Mekudeshes through Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach this! A Yevamah cannot be acquired through money, but she can be acquired through Bi'ah. A woman can be Mekudeshes through money, all the more so, she can be Mekudeshes through Bi'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> An Amah disproves the Kal va'Chomer, for she can be acquired with money, but not through Bi'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That does not disprove the Kal va'Chomer. An Amah cannot be acquired through Bi'ah because she is not acquired for the sake of marriage. A wife is acquired for the sake of marriage!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"And he has Bi'ah with her" (teaches that she can be Mekudeshes through Bi'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We defended the Kal va'Chomer. Why must we learn from the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> One can uproot the Kal va'Chomer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learned from acquisition of a Yevamah. Bi'ah alone does not acquire a Yevamah. She is already partially acquired from the Kidushin of the deceased brother! (We cannot learn to Kidushin, in which the woman is not already partially acquired.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Therefore, we must learn from the verse.</p>
