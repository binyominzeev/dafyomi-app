<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DO WE EXPOUND EVERY ES?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Shimon ha'Amsoni used to expound every "Es" in the Torah (to include something). For "you will fear Es Hash-m", he found nothing to include.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">His Talmidim:</span> If so, perhaps also the other occurrences of "Es" should not be expounded!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> Indeed, I retract them all! Just like I will receive reward for what I expounded (at the time, I believed that it was true), I will be rewarded for refusing to expound.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> "You will fear Es Hash-m" includes Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THINGS ONE MAY NOT BENEFIT FROM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Eglah Arufah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> Regarding it, it says "Kaparah (atonement)", just like regarding Kodshim (which are Asur b'Hana'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Birds used for Taharas Metzora.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> The Torah discusses Machshirim (things that permit) and Kaparos brought in the Mikdash and outside;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Inside, we do not distinguish Machshirim (Asham Metzora, which permits him to eat Kodshim) from Kaparos (other Ashamos, which atone);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also outside, we do not distinguish Machshirim (birds of a Metzora, which permit him to enter walled cities) from Kaparos (Eglah Arufah; both are forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When do the birds become forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> It is from when one is slaughtered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> It is from Kichah (when they are bought or taken for Taharas Metzora).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan forbids from Shechitah, for Shechitah forbids it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reish Lakish forbids from Kichah. He learns from (a Gezeirah Shavah from) Eglah Arufah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like Eglah Arufah is forbidden while it is alive, also birds of a Metzora.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> From when is Eglah Arufah forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Yanai:</span> There is a time when it becomes forbidden. I forgot it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabanan):</span> It is from when it is taken down to the valley.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like Eglah Arufah is not forbidden from Kichah, we should say the same about birds of a Metzora!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. For Eglah Arufah, there is a later time for it to become forbidden while alive;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Torah does not say anything else about the birds while they are alive. If they are not forbidden from Kichah, when will they become forbidden?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> "You may eat every Tahor bird" includes the bird (of a Metzora) that is sent away;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"These you may not eat" includes the bird that is slaughtered.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they were forbidden while alive, we would not need another verse to forbid after Shechitah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that it is like Kodshim, which are forbidden while alive and permitted after slaughter. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a bird was slaughtered and found to be Tereifah, another bird is taken to replace it. It is used with the other of the original two birds. One may benefit from the Tereifah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the birds were forbidden while alive, the Tereifah should still be forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, we know that it was Tereifah from when the bird was taken (e.g. it has no liver, so it was never Kosher for Taharah of a Metzora).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Yakov):</span> If a bird was slaughtered without the required cedar, hyssop and scarlet thread, since the bird was set aside for the Mitzvah, it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon says, since the Shechitah was not like required, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue only about whether or not an improper Shechitah is considered Shechitah. All agree that it is permitted while alive!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, they hold like R. Yochanan. Reish Lakish holds like the following Tana:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> The Torah discusses Machshirim and Kaparos brought in the Mikdash, and a Machshir and Kaparah brought outside;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Inside, we do not distinguish Machshirim (Asham Metzora) from Kaparos (other Ashamos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Also outside, we do not distinguish Machshirim (birds of a Metzora) from Kaparos (Eglah Arufah. Both are forbidden while alive.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHY IS THE SLAUGHTERED BIRD FORBIDDEN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "You may eat every Tahor bird" includes the bird of a Metzora that is sent away. "These you may not eat" includes the Shechutah (the bird that is slaughtered).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the first verse permits the Shechutah, and the second verse forbids the one that is sent away!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> We never find that living beings are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> If an animal was designated to be offered to idolatry, or if it was worshipped, it is forbidden while alive!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">57b----------------------------------------57b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is Pasul for a Korban. R. Yochanan meant that living beings are never forbidden to people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmiyah):</span> If an animal had Bi'ah with a human (and was sentenced to be stoned), it is forbidden while alive!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, usually, living beings are not forbidden (so it is more reasonable to say that the Shechutah is forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (b) - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "He will send it towards the field" equates the bird to a field;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a field is permitted, also the sent bird.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That verse teaches something else!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "(He will send it towards the) field" he may not stand in Yafo and send it towards the sea, in Gavas and send it towards the wilderness, or outside the city and send it towards the city;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, he stands inside the city and throws it outside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yishmael holds that the letter Hei ("ha'Sadeh") is extra to additionally teach that the sent bird is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> If the sent bird were forbidden, this would be a stumbling block for one who will find the bird (and eat it), unaware that it was used for a Metzora. Surely, the Torah would not do so!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THINGS ASUR B'HANA'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Hair of a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source it is Asur b'Hana'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He will be Kodesh, he will grow the hair of his head" - his growth (of hair) will be Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Hekdesh is exchanged for money (or Shavah Kesef), the Kedushah transfers to the money and the Hekdesh becomes permitted. This should apply also to the hair of a Nazir!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We read, his hair will be Kadosh (sanctified), not Kodesh (as Hekdesh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A firstborn donkey.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah is not like R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi Yehudah):</span> One may not benefit from a firstborn donkey;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon permits this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman):</span> All agree that it is Asur b'Hana'ah after breaking its neck (our Mishnah discusses this. The Tana'im argue about while it is alive.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Meat (cooked) with milk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that it is Asur b'Hana'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> It says three times "you will not cook a kid in its mother's milk." These forbid eating the mixture, benefiting from it, and cooking it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Our Mishnah is not like the following Tana:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Yehudah):</span> One may not eat meat cooked with milk, but one may benefit from it. It says "you are a holy nation to Hash-m" regarding meat and milk, and also regarding Tereifah meat;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like one may not eat a Tereifah, but he may benefit from it (the Torah allows giving it to dogs), also regarding meat and milk.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>CHULIN SLAUGHTERED IN THE MIKDASH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chulin ba'Azarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that this is Asur b'Hana'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> The Torah told us to slaughter Hash-m's animals (Korbanos) in His dwelling (the Mikdash), and our animals (Chulin) in our dwellings (everywhere else);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like if one slaughters His animals in our dwellings, they are forbidden, also if one slaughters our animals in His dwelling.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like one who slaughters His animals in our dwellings is Chayav Kares, also one who slaughters our animals in His dwelling!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "He did not bring to the Mikdash... a Korban... he will be cut off" - Kares is for a Korban (slaughtered outside the Mikdash), not for Chulin ba'Azarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Since there is a stringency of Kodshim slaughtered outside (Kares) that does not apply to Chulin ba'Azarah, we cannot learn that Chulin ba'Azarah is Asur b'Hana'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> We learn from the repetition "he will slaughter it", "he will slaughter it", "he will slaughter it."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are these verses needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "when you will be far from Hash-m's chosen place (and you will slaughter your animals)" - you may slaughter (your animals) only far from the Mikdash, but not in the Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches only about unblemished animals, which could be Korbanos. What is the source that even blemished animals may not be slaughtered in the Mikdash?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are also forbidden, for they are the same species as animals Kosher for Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Chayos (wild animals) may not be slaughtered in the Mikdash?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are also forbidden, for the Torah explicitly requires slaughtering them, like Beheimos.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that birds may not be slaughtered in the Mikdash?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He will slaughter it", "he will slaughter it", he will slaughter it" (forbids slaughtering Chayos and birds in the Mikdash, and forbids eating Chulin ba'Azarah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one may not slaughter, but if one slaughtered, one may eat it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "When you will be far from Hash-m's chosen place, and you will slaughter and eat" - you may eat only (Chulin) that you slaughter far from the Mikdash, but not what you slaughter in the Mikdash.</p>
