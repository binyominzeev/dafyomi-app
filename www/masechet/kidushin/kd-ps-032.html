<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FEAR AND HONOR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must a son honor his father from his own money?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Nasan bar Oshaya):</span> No, it is only from the father's money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yirmiyah asked, and was told to follow R. Nasan's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> It says "honor your father and mother", and "honor Hash-m from your wealth." Just like one must spend money to honor Hash-m, also to honor parents.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If honor of parents is from the parents' money, the son gets back whatever money he spends!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is not reimbursed for time he spent honoring them and was unable to work.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> In the following pairs, either member may redeem Ma'aser Sheni of the other without adding a fifth. Also, either member may feed the other Ma'aser Oni (if the latter is poor):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The pairs are two brothers; two partners; a father and son; and a Rebbi and Talmid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the son must spend to honor his father, he may not fulfill his obligation with Ma'aser that belongs to the poor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He must use his own (Chulin) money to feed the father the basics. Ma'aser Oni may be used only for extra food (that he need not give).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - Rebbi Yehudah):</span> A curse will come upon one who feeds his father Ma'aser Oni!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Ma'aser Oni is only for extras, what is wrong with this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Still, it is disgraceful.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> The extent of honoring parents is if the parent throws a wallet in the sea, and the child does not embarrass the parent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If honor of parents is from the parents' money, (we discuss throwing the father's wallet, or in any case the child will be compensated), why does the child care?! (It is not hard to refrain from embarrassing the parent.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the child is destined to inherit the parent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Huna tore silk in front of his son Rabah, to see if Rabah would get angry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could he do that? If Rabah would get angry, Rav Huna would have transgressed putting a stumbling block before the blind!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Huna pardoned his honor (so Rabah would not transgress if he got angry).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Huna transgressed wasting money!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He tore it at the seams, so it did not depreciate.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why would Rabah get angry?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Huna (looked) angry when he tore it (so Rabah would assume that it was torn destructively).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW TO CORRECT A PARENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yechezkel - Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> If people sentenced to be burned became mixed with people sentenced to be stoned, they are stoned, because this is less severe than burning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(His son Rami):</span> Father, don't teach that way! 'Were mixed with people sentenced to be stoned' connotes that the majority should be stoned. Even if burning were not more severe, they would be stoned!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, teach 'if people sentenced to be stoned became mixed with people standing to be burned (they are stoned, because this is less severe)'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yechezkel - Reisha - Chachamim):</span> They are burned, because this is less severe.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since the majority should be burned, even if burning were not less severe, they would be burned!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rami):</span> Chachamim merely come to argue about R. Shimon and say that stoning is more severe. (R. Shimon already taught that we always give the lighter punishment.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Shmuel (to Rami):</span> You shouldn't speak that way to your father!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one sees his father transgress a Torah law he should not say 'father, you transgressed', rather, 'father, this is what the Torah says.'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That will pain the father!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he says 'father, there is a verse in the Torah that says...'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PRIORITES OF HONOR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar ben Masya):</span> If my father asks me to serve him, and I have a Mitzvah to do, the Mitzvah takes precedence, because also my father is obligated to do Mitzvos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Isi ben Yehudah says, if the Mitzvah can be done by others, the son should serve his father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Masnah):</span> The Halachah follows Isi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Shilo):</span> A father can pardon the honor due to him. A Rebbi cannot;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Even a Rebbi can pardon his honor - "Hash-m went in front of them (Yisrael) by day (in a cloud)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> That is not comparable!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m owns the whole world, so He can pardon His honor;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">32b----------------------------------------32b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Rebbi does not own his Torah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> I erred. A Rebbi owns his Torah. It says "in his Torah he will think day and night"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava was serving at a feast in honor of Rava's son's wedding. Rav Papa and Rav Huna Brei d'Rav Yehoshua stood up for Rava, but Rav Mari and Rav Pinchas, sons of Rav Chisda, did not. Rava was upset.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Do you think that you are Chachamim, but Rav Papa and Rav Huna are not?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A similar episode occurred in which R. Yitzchak Brei d'Rav Yehudah did not stand for Rav Papa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even if the Rebbi pardons his honor, the Talmid should move a bit to show desire to stand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Even according to the opinion that a Rebbi can pardon his honor, a Nasi (the leader of the Chachamim) cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> When R. Gamliel married off his son, he was serving at the meal. R. Eliezer refused to take from him; R. Yehoshua took from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> How can we sit while R. Gamliel stands and serves us?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> We find someone greater that served. Avraham was the greatest of his generation, and he served his guests!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He did not know that they were angels. He thought they were nomads!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Tzadok:</span> Why do you discuss mortals, and neglect Hash-m?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Hash-m brings winds, raises clouds, makes rain fall, makes vegetation flourish, and sets a table in front of everyone. All the more so, R. Gamliel can serve us!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Rav Ashi taught that even according to the opinion that a Nasi can pardon his honor, a king cannot;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"You will put a king upon you" - his fear should be upon you.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>FOR WHOM WE MUST STAND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "you will rise for an elder" includes even a wicked, unlearned elder!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Zaken" connotes a Chacham - "gather for me 70 men from the Zekenim of Yisrael".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rebbi Yosi ha'Glili says, "Zaken" denotes one 'she'KaNah' (who acquired) Chachmah - "Hash-m Konani Reishis Darcho."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one must rise when the Zaken is far away.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "You will rise and honor" - the Mitzvah to rise is only where it will honor him (nearby, where it is evident why he stood).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one must give money to the Zaken to honor him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "You will rise and honor" - just like one does not lose money by rising, he need not lose by honoring.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one must rise even in the privy or bathhouse!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "You will rise and honor" - the Mitzvah to rise is only in a place fit to honor him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one may close his eyes, as if he does not see the Zaken (to avoid having to rise)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "You will rise and you will fear" - for Mitzvos in which others cannot perceive one's intent, it says "you will fear Hash-m (who knows your intention)".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, "Zaken and you will fear" teaches that a Zaken should not unnecessarily cause that people must rise for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Isi ben Yehudah says, "you will rise in front of an elder" refers to any elder.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The first Tana and Rebbi Yosi ha'Glili agree!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about whether or not one must rise for a young Chacham. Rebbi Yosi ha'Glili obligates doing so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the Torah wanted that one must rise only for an old Chacham, it should have written 'in front of an old Zaken, rise and honor';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it put words between "old" and "Zaken", to teach that one can be "old" without being "Zaken", or vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>The first Tana holds that if two different people were included, the Torah would have written 'in front of an elder, rise and honor; rise and honor a Zaken';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, the Torah refers to one person (an old Chacham).</p>
