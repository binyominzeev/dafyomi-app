<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO MAY GIVE AND RECEIVE THE MONEY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Leah told Reuven 'give money to Ploni, and I will be Mekudeshes to you', we learn from the law of an Arev (guarantor) that this works.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An Arev obligates himself (to pay a loan, if the lender does not), even though the Arev does not benefit. Likewise, Leah can acquire herself to Reuven without receiving the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one told Leah 'take this money and be Mekudeshes to Ploni', we learn from (redemption of) a Kena'ani slave that this works.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When one pays a Kena'ani slave's master to redeem him, the slave acquires himself (his freedom), even though he does not pay. Likewise, Ploni can acquire a wife without paying.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Leah told Reuven 'give money to Ploni, and I will be Mekudeshes to him', we learn from the laws of an Arev and a slave that this works.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An Arev obligates himself, even though he does not benefit. Likewise, Leah can acquire herself (to Ploni) without receiving money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Here is different! An Arev becomes obligated to one who gave money. Leah wants to become Mekudeshes to a man who did not pay!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Kena'ani slave. He acquires himself without paying. (Also Ploni can acquire a wife without paying!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is different. The master, who causes the slave to acquire himself, receives money. Here, the woman acquires herself to Ploni without receiving anything!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from an Arev that she can acquire herself without receiving anything.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If Leah told Reuven 'take this money, and I will be Mekudeshes to you', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar Zutra):</span> She is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> (A verse equates slaves (and all people) to land.) How can land (Leah) be acquired Agav (along with) Metaltelim (the money)? The opposite is true!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Metaltelim are acquired Agav land when an acquisition is done on the land, namely giving money, a document, or Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar Zutra):</span> She is not acquired Agav the money. I discuss giving money to a distinguished person. He gives her Hana'ah (pleasure) by accepting her gift. This Hana'ah is Mekadesh her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> These laws apply also to sales.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>It is necessary to teach these laws in both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had we heard only regarding Kidushin, we would think that they only work there, for a woman is happy to marry any man.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> A woman prefers to be married than to remain single.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had we heard only regarding monetary laws, we would think that they work only there, for one can pardon someone's obligation to pay him, but not by Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PARTIAL KIDUSHIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one told a woman 'you should be Mekudeshes to half of me', she is Mekudeshes to him. If he said 'half of you is Mekudeshes to me', she is not Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Presumably, 'half of you is Mekudeshes to me' does not work because it says "(a man will take) a woman", but not half a woman;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Likewise, 'you should be Mekudeshes to half of me' should not work. The Torah discusses a man, and not half a man!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> A woman cannot be married to two men. He must mean that he wants to be Mekadesh only half of her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A man can marry two women. When he said 'you are Mekudeshes to half of me', he merely warns her that he may marry another woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Zutra Brei d'Rav Mari):</span> The Kidushin should spread to apply to all of her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one said 'the leg of this animal is an Olah', the entire animal is an Olah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One opinion says it is not entirely an Olah, but all agree that agrees that if one was Makdish something vital for life, the entire animal is an Olah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> There is different. An animal has no input in becoming Hekdesh, we are concerned only for the intention of the owner;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, the woman must agree to the Kidushin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Kidushin is more comparable to R. Yochanan's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If Reuven and Shimon were partners in an animal, and Reuven made his half a Korban, then bought Shimon's share and made it a Korban as well, the animal is Hekdesh, but it cannot be offered. (Reuven's initial Hekdesh did not work entirely, because Shimon's consent was required);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If one makes Temurah on the animal (tries to transfer its Kedushah to a Chulin animal), the Chulin animal gets the same status.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>We learn three things from R. Yochanan's law;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Dichuy applies to living animals (if an animal was once Pasul (disqualified) from being offered, it is permanently Pasul, even if the reason it became Pasul goes away);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Dichuy applies even if it was Pasul from when it became Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Dichuy applies even to Kedushas Damim (something that was made Hekdesh to be sold to buy a Korban).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rava):</span> If one told a woman 'half of you is Mekudeshes to me with half a Perutah, and half of you with half a Perutah', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since he said 'half of you', that shows that he was Mekadesh only half of her (and then tried again to be Mekadesh half of her. She is not Mekudeshes);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he just tallies how much he is being Mekadesh (and in total, he is Mekadesh all of her)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If you will say that he just tallies, if he said 'I am Mekadesh half of you with a Perutah, and half of you with a Perutah', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since he gave a Perutah (the amount required for Kidushin) for half, this shows that he is Mekadesh only half each time;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps the entire day he tallies how much he is Mekadesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> If you will say that the entire day he just tallies, if he said 'I am Mekadesh half of you today with a Perutah, and half of you tomorrow with a Perutah', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since he said 'tomorrow', this shows that he is Mekadesh half each time;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he just tells her that the Kidushin should start today and finish tomorrow!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he said 'I am Mekadesh both halves of you with a Perutah' what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, surely he is Mekadesh her at once;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps one cannot be Mekadesh a woman in halves at all!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>These questions are not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE PERUTAH REQUIRED FOR KIDUSHIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'I am Mekadesh your two daughters to my two sons with one Perutah', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>From the standpoint of the giver and receiver, Reuven gives a Perutah and Shimon receives a Perutah (so both acts of Kidushin are valid);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, do we require that a Perutah is received for each girl who becomes Mekudeshes (so they are not Mekudashos)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If one said 'I am Mekadesh your daughter and buy your cow with a Perutah', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does he give half a Perutah for each (and acquires neither)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, is he Mekadesh with a Perutah, and intends to acquire the cow by taking it to his premises?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> If one said 'I am Mekadesh your daughter and buy your land with a Perutah', what is the law? (This is unlike the previous case, for money can acquire land, but it cannot</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does he give half a Perutah for each (and acquires neither)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does he Mekadesh with a Perutah, and intend to buy the land through Chazakah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MUST SOMETHING GIVEN FOR KIDUSHIN BE APPRAISED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If one was Mekadesh a woman with silk, we need not appraise the silk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The silk must be appraised.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> If he told her that he is Mekadesh her with Kol d'Hu (any amount), all agree that no appraisal is needed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he told her that it is worth 50, and it is not, she did not agree to be Mekudeshes for less!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>They argue in a case when he told her that it is worth 50, and it is;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rabah does not require an appraisal, for it is worth 50;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Yosef requires an appraisal. Since women do not know the value, if it is not appraised, she does not resolve that she wants to be Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> They argue also about one who said that he is Mekadesh with Kol d'Hu;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Yosef says, Shavah Kesef (something worth money) must be like money (to be Mekadesh). Just like money is Kayitz (has a known value), also Shavah Kesef.</p>
