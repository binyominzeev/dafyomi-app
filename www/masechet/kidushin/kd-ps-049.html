<p class="dedicationbox">KIDUSHIN 49 - Dedicated by Rabbi Kornfeld's father in memory of his aunt, Malka Gitel bas Reb Yakov Mordechai (Malvina Marmorstein), who took him into her home and raised him like her own child after the Holocaust. Her Yahrzeit is 20 Nisan. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MAKING A SUGGESTION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In a normal Get, the witnesses sign on the front. In a tied Get (which is folded like an accordion and sewn), they sign on the back. If they signed on the wrong side (of either Get), it is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Chanina ben Gamliel says, if they signed on the front of a tied Get, it is valid, because it can be untied and made into a regular Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, everything is like the local custom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the first Tana disagree?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> If there is a standard custom in that locale (which type of Get is used), all agree that one who authorizes a Get is insistent that it be like the custom (if the scribe deviated, it is invalid);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue in a place where both types of Gitin are used, and he asked for a regular Get, and the scribe wrote a tied Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The first Tana holds that he is insistent. R. Shimon ben Gamliel holds that he merely suggests that a regular Get is also fine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Eliezer holds that one merely makes a suggestion in the following Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman told a Shali'ach 'receive my Get in the place Ploni', and he received it elsewhere, it is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer says, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Eliezer holds she merely suggested that her husband can probably be found in Ploni.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE ARGUMENT IN OUR MISHNAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> R. Shimon and Chachamim argue only about monetary Shevach. Regarding Shevach lineage, all agree that she is not Mekudeshes. (She does not want one who will be arrogant due to his superior lineage.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Ashi - the next Mishnah):</span> If he was Mekadesh 'on condition that I am a Kohen', and he was found to be a Levi', or vice-versa, or 'on condition that I am a Nasin' (a descendant of the Giv'onim, one of the seven Kena'ani nations), and he was found to be a Mamzer', or vice-versa, she is not Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon does not argue!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar bar Rav Ashi - Seifa):</span> If he said 'on condition that I have a Megudeles (adult) daughter or Shifchah', and he does not have, or vice-versa (she is not Mekudeshes).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Shifchah is monetary. Surely R. Shimon argues (in a case of Shevach, i.e. he really has one)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, since R. Shimon argued in our Mishnah, we know that he argues in the next Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We can say the same about Shevach lineage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The comparison is faulty!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding monetary Shevach, since he argued in our Mishnah, surely he argues in the next Mishnah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he argues also about Shevach lineage, the Mishnah must teach this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The case of the Shifchah is also a case of Shevach lineage. 'Megudeles' means she is esteemed (Rashi; Tosfos - a hairdresser). Such a slave can spread stories about her master's wife!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW MUCH IS EXPECTED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one was Mekadesh 'on condition that I am a Karaina (one who reads the Torah in the Beis ha'Keneses)', if he has read three verses of the Torah for the Tzibur, she is Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rebbi Yehudah says, he must read and translate three verses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One may not give his own translation!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi Yehudah):</span> If one translates a verse according to the simple meaning of the words, he is a falsifier. If he adds on, he blasphemes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi Yehudah means that he recites the received translation (of Unkelos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he said 'on condition that I am a Kara', she is Mekudeshes only if he is proficient at reading all of written Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> If he said 'in condition that I am Shoneh (learn)', he must learn Halachos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He must learn Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> 'Mishnah' refers to Halachos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi Yehudah says, it refers to Medrash. (R. Yochanan is unlike either Tana!)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">49b----------------------------------------49b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan meant that he must learn Torah, i.e. Medrash (expositions of) Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>This (argument of Chizkiyah and R. Yochanan) is only when he said "I learn." If he said 'on condition that I am a Tana', he must be able to recite Halachos, Sifra, Sifri (the Halachic Midrashim on Vayikra, and on Bamidbar and Devarim), and Tosefta.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If he said 'on condition that I am a Talmid', he need not be as great as Ben Azai. It suffices if he knows something well enough that he can answer questions on it, even tractate 'Kalah' (a long Beraisa).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>If he said 'on condition that I am a Chacham' he need not be like Chachamim of Yavneh, like R. Akiva and his colleagues;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It suffices if he can answer a question based on reasoning, in any place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>If he said 'on condition that I am mighty', he need not be like Avner or Yo'av (the chief generals of Sha'ul and David). Rather it suffices if people fear him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>If he said 'on condition that I am rich', he need not be as rich as R. Eliezer ben Charsom or R. Eliezer ben Azaryah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It suffices if he is honored in his city like a rich man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>If he said 'on condition that I am a Tzadik', even if he is (established to be) an absolute Rasha, she is (Safek) Mekudeshes, perhaps he repented in his heart.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>If he said 'on condition that I am a Rasha, even if he is (established to be) a perfect Tzadik, she is (Safek) Mekudeshes. Perhaps he served idolatry in his heart.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>GIFTS SHARED AMONG THE WORLD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Ten measures of Chochmah came to the world. Eretz Yisrael received nine, the rest of the world received one.</p>

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> They were carrying flattery and haughtiness, which descended to Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, it descended to Bavel. From Bavel, nine tenths went to Eilam.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> It says "to build for it a house." (The house was not built, for it did not stay. Alternatively, we learn from "Lah", which is written without a Mapik (dot in the) Hei.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We learned that poverty is a sign of haughtiness, and poverty is in Bavel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That teaching refers to poverty in Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "We have a young sister, she has no breasts" refers to Eilam, which merited to learn Torah, but not to teach it.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In the following cases, she is not Mekudeshes:</p>
