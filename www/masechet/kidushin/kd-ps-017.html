<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHICH SLAVES GET GIFTS? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> The case is, the slave fled, and Yovel came (before he returned);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that since Yovel frees him, it is as if the master sent him, and he receives gifts. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so. He is fined, and gets no gifts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Beraisa said that even if a slave was ill, "in the seventh year he will leave."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is even if he was ill all six years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If he was sick for three years and worked for three years, he need not work any more. If he was sick all six years, he must complete his term of service.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> He goes free (even if he was sick all six years) as long as he was doing some work during his illness (e.g. sewing).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Reisha said that if he was sick for three years and worked for three years, he need not work any more. This implies that had he been sick for four years, he would have to complete the time missed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Seifa said that if he was sick all six years, he must complete his term. This implies that if he was sick for four years, he is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa means that if he was sick for four years, it is as if he was sick all six years, and he must complete his term.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT GIFT IS GIVEN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> The slave receives a gift of five Sela'im worth of each category (flock, grain and wine), 15 Sela'im in all;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rebbi Yehudah says, he receives 30 Sela'im, just like the payment for a (Kena'ani) slave killed regarding a Mu'ad (an animal established to gore);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon says, he gets 50 Sela'im, like the highest Erech (a pledge to Hekdesh based on a person's age and gender).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did R. Meir need to say that the total gift is 15? (Since he gets five of each category, clearly he gets 15!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that as long as the slave receives 15, we do not care if exactly five was from each category.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Meir's source (that he gets five of each category)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from a Gezeirah Shavah "Reikam-Reikam" from Pidyon ha'Ben (redemption of a firstborn son).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like Pidyon ha'Ben is five Sela'im, also the gift is five Sela'im of each category.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the total value is five Sela'im!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said "Reikam" after the categories, we would indeed say so!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, "Reikam" is said before, to teach that five Sela'im applies to each of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we learn from "Reikam" written regarding Olas Re'iyah (a Korban that every man must bring on each festival, which need not be worth so much)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "That Hash-m blessed you" shows that one gives the larger amount.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Rebbi Yehudah prefer to learn from the payment for a slave who was gored?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from a Gezeirah Shavah "Nesinah-Nesinah".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he not learn the Gezeirah Shavah (on the same words) from Erchin (Rashba - of people; Tosfos Rid - redemption of a Hekdesh field right after Yovel), and say that the gift is 50?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If there are two ways to learn, we learn the smaller Chidush.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is more reasonable to learn a law about a slave from a law about a slave.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW THE TANA'IM EXPOUND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Shimon prefer to learn 50, from Erchin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He learns from a Gezeirah Shavah "Nesinah-Nesinah".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he not learn the smallest Erech? (Tosfos Rid - this is redemption of a Hekdesh field right after Yovel, slightly more than one Sela; Rashba - it is five Sela'im. I do not know why we would not learn from the Erech of a small girl, which is only three Sela'im.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "That Hash-m blessed you" shows that we give the largest amount.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why don't we learn the Gezeirah Shavah (Nesinah-Nesinah) from a gored slave, and say that the gift is 30?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If there are two ways to learn, we always learn the smaller Chidush;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Also, it is more reasonable to learn about a slave from a law about a slave!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he learns a Gezeirah Shavah "Michah-Michah" from Erchin (of people).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Meir, we understand why the Torah wrote three categories (to teach that we give five Sela'im from each);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rebbi Yehudah and R. Shimon, why was this needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> One might have thought that the gift can be only from flock, grain, and wine. "That Hash-m blessed you" teaches that other things may be given.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did the Torah specify flock, grain and wine?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Just like these increase (reproduce), the gift must be something that reproduces. This excludes money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, this excludes mules.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Shimon includes mules, for they grow larger.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov includes money, for it may be invested profitably.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>All three categories needed to be written;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had the Torah written only "flock", one might have thought that only animals may be given, but not vegetation. It says "grain" to include vegetation;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had the Torah written only "grain", one might have thought that only vegetation may be given, but not animals. It says "flock" to include animals;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">17b----------------------------------------17b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon holds that "wine" excludes money. R. Eliezer ben Yakov holds that it excludes mules (Rashi. Tosfos - R. Shimon holds that it includes mules, and R. Eliezer ben Yakov holds that it includes money.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "that Hash-m blessed you" exempt a master from giving gifts if he was not blessed (did not prosper) while the slave worked for him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ha'anik (give a gift) Ta'anik", even if he was not blessed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say "that Hash-m blessed you"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he was blessed, he should give (more than the minimum,) according to the Berachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Eliezer ben Azaryah says, if the master was not blessed, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>He does not expound "Ha'anik Ta'anik." The Torah speaks the way people speak.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DOES THE SLAVE SERVE HEIRS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the master dies, an Eved Ivri serves the son, but not the daughter;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An Amah, a Nirtza, or one sold to a Nochri goes free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that an Eved Ivri serves the son, but not the daughter?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "He will serve you six years" - you, but not an heir (i.e. the daughter).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it means that he will not serve any heir!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "he will serve (without saying 'you') six years" to teach that he serves an heir (the son).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we say that the heir he serves is the son? Perhaps it is the brother!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable that it is the son, for he is in place of his father for Yi'ud (to marry the father's Amah), and to redeem a field his father made Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Objection; It is more reasonable that it is the brother, for one is in place of his brother to do Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yibum applies only when there is no son. (This shows that a son is a better replacement (for his father) than a brother is.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is such an answer needed? Even if the brother were better regarding Yibum, the son is better in two respects!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot count redemption of the field, for the verse did not specify who is in place of his father. If the brother were indeed better regarding Yibum, we would not know who is better regarding the field!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> An Amah does not serve the son or daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Pada):</span> "You will do so even to your Amah" equates an Amah to a Nirtza;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a Nirtza does not serve either child, also an Amah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learn something else from this verse!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "You will do so even to your Amah" - she also receives gifts when she leaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it rather teaches that she can become Nirtza'as!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "If the (male) slave will say (that he wants to become a Nirtza)", and not an Amah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the verse come only to teach about not serving an heir, it would say "even to your Amah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It adds "you will do so" to additionally teach that she receives gifts.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>INHERITANCE OF A NOCHRI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Nirtza or a slave sold to a Nochri does not serve the son or daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn about a Nirtza from "...he will serve him forever", but he will not serve his son or daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for a slave sold to a Nochri?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Chizkiyah):</span> "He will calculate (the redemption) with the one who bought him", not with the buyer's heirs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Torah needed to teach that a Nochri does not inherit his father's slave. This shows that a Nochri inherits his father mid'Oraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A convert does not inherit his father mid'Oraisa, only mid'Rabanan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a convert and a Nochri (his brother) inherited their father (a Nochri), the convert may tell his brother 'take the idols, and I will take the money. Take the wine used for idolatry, and I will take produce.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the convert already received the idolatry or wine, he may not trade it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If a convert inherited mid'Oraisa, even before he receives them, they would be (half) his. It would be forbidden to trade them, for this is benefit from idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Rather, he inherits mid'Rabanan. This is a decree, lest he revert to being a Nochri if he would not inherit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> One can say 'take the idols, and I will take the money' when splitting an inheritance. A partner with a Nochri may not say this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A Nochri or a convert do not inherit a convert, not mid'Oraisa nor mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven borrowed money from Yisro, a convert whose children converted with him, and Yisro died, Reuven should not return the money to Yisro's children. Chachamim are upset if he does.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If he returns to them, Chachamim are pleased!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If their mother converted before the birth (but they were conceived before their father converted), it is good to return the money. If their mother was a Nochris when they were born, it is bad to return the money (Rashi; Ri in Tosfos learns differently).</p>
