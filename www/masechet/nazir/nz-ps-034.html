<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>NEZIRUS</i> ON CONDITION (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah cannot be R. Tarfon. Since when he vowed, he did not know whether or not it was Ploni, he would not be a Nazir!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah citing R. Tarfon):</span> None of them are Nezirim, because Nezirus must be accepted with certainty.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Mishnah is like R. Yehudah's own opinion in the Beraisa of the stack (that one accepts Nezirus only if his words will be verified):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> If one said 'I am a Nazir on condition that this stack contains 100 Kor (a measure)', and he found that it was stolen and he could not measure it, he is forbidden (all Isurei Nezirus);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah permits.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Shimon holds that had it not been stolen, perhaps it would have been found to hold 100 Kor, and he would be a Nazir. Even now that it was stolen, he is a Nazir (due to the doubt);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Also in our Mishnah, R. Shimon would say that since if we would have verified that this is Ploni, Reuven would be a Nazir, now that we are in doubt, he is also a Nazir!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Nine men saw a Koy. (Chachamim were unsure if it is a Chayah or Beheimah (wild or domestic animal). Reuven (the first) said 'I am a Nazir if this is a Chayah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> I am a Nazir if it is not a Chayah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Levi:</span> I am a Nazir if it is a Beheimah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Yehudah:</span> I am a Nazir if it is not a Beheimah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Yisachar:</span> I am a Nazir if this is a Chayah and a Beheimah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Zevulun:</span> I am a Nazir if this is not a Chayah nor a Beheimah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Gad:</span> I am a Nazir if one of (the six of) you is a Nazir;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Asher:</span> I am a Nazir if one of you is not a Nazir;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Dan:</span> I am a Nazir if all of you are Nezirim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>All of them are Nezirim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa #1):</span> Nine men are Nezirim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> One man must fulfill nine Neziruyos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, in Beraisa #1, nine men accepted Nezirus, like in the Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>How can one man accept nine Neziruyos (through these nine acceptances)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Granted, he accepts six like the first six men in the Mishnah. But how does he accept the last three?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> Nine men accepted Nezirus like in the Mishnah. A 10th man accepted all their Neziruyos on himself.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE <i>ISURIM</i> OF A <i>NAZIR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are three categories of Isurim of a Nazir: Tum'ah, shaving, and eating what grows on grapevines.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>All that comes from vines joins. One is liable only for eating a k'Zayis (the volume of an olive) of grapes.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">34b----------------------------------------34b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The initial version of the Mishnah said that one is liable only if he drinks a quarter Log of wine;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Akiva says, even if he soaked his bread in wine and he ate a k'Zayis, he is liable. (We shall see that the bread can join to comprise the Shi'ur, as long as it is the minority.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>One is liable for each of the following by itself - wine, grapes, Chartzanim and Zag (grape pits and peels);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Eliezer ben Azaryah says, one is liable only for eating two pits and a peel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Yehudah says, "Chartzanim" refers to grape peels. "Zag" is the pits;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yosi says, (they are the opposite;) a way to remember them is a bell. "Zag" is the outer part, and Inbal is the clapper.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah) Version #1:</span> There are three categories of Isurim of a Nazir: Tum'ah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> What comes from the vine is forbidden, but the vine itself is permitted! The Mishnah is unlike R. Eliezer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Even the leaves and Lulavim (thin branches, i.e. edible young sprouts) of the grapevine are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Mishnah):</span> One is liable only for eating a k'Zayis of grapes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> One is liable for grapes, but not for the vine itself! The Mishnah is unlike R. Eliezer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Even the leaves and Lulavim are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>METHODS OF EXPOUNDING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do R. Eliezer and Chachamim argue?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer expounds the Torah via the method of Ribuy and Mi'ut (inclusions and exclusions). Chachamim expound via Klal and Prat (general terms and specific terms).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Eliezer expounds Ribuy and Mi'ut. "From wine and strong drink he will refrain" is a Mi'ut. "From all that is made from the grapevine" is a Ribuy;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Mi'ut v'Ribuy includes everything, and excludes one thing. Here, we exclude branches.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim expound Klal and Prat. "From wine and strong drink he will refrain" is a Prat. "From all that is made from the grapevine" is a Klal. "Me'Chartzanim v'Ad Zag" is another Klal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Klal u'Frat u'Chlal includes only what resembles the Klalim. The Peratim are fruit and Pesoles (waste by-products) of fruit. All fruit and Pesoles of fruit are included.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Peratim are finished fruits. Perhaps we should include only finished fruit!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the Derashah would not teach anything not explicit in the Torah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Moist and dry grapes are written. Wine and vinegar are written!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must say like above (fruits and Pesoles of fruits).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since we will include everything, why did the Torah write "me'Chartzanim v'Ad Zag" (after the Klal? It could have written it with the other Peratim!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that we expound a Prat u'Chlal to include only what resembles the Prat only if it is followed by another Prat. If not, the Klal adds onto the Prat (and we include everything).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We said that the Peratim are fruit and Pesoles of fruit, so we include all fruit and Pesoles of fruit. Fruits are grapes. What is Pesoles of fruit?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is vinegar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What other fruit is included?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We include unripe grapes (Tosfos; Rashi - small grapes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Pesoles of fruit is included?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We include wormy grapes (Tosfos; Aruch - grapes stricken on the vine).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> "V'Ad Zag" includes the inside of the grape (Rashi; R. Tam - grapes that do not ripen properly because they are shadowed by other grapes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Above, we learned from "me'Chartzanim v'Ad Zag" that we expound a Prat u'Chlal to include only what resembles the Prat only if it is followed by another Prat.</p>
