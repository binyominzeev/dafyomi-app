<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not Hakafas Kol ha'Rosh is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Do not round the corners of your head" applies even to a Metzora (who must shave to become Tahor)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "(A Metzora shaves) Rosho" teaches that he shaves even his Pe'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "A Ta'ar will not pass over Rosho (of a Nazir)" applies even to a Metzora!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Rosho" teaches that he shaves his head even if he is a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Tana of Beraisa #2 permits Hakafas Kol ha'Rosh. (Therefore, we need no source to permit a regular Metzora to shave his Pe'os.) "Rosho" teaches that the Mitzvah for a Metzora to shave overrides an Aseh and a Lav (for a Nazir to shave his head);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Tana of Beraisa #1 forbids Hakafas Kol ha'Rosh. "Rosho" teaches that the Mitzvah for a Metzora to shave overrides a Lav (Hakafah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Rava):</span> No, both permit Hakafas Kol ha'Rosh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Rosho" permits shaving the Pe'os first, and then the rest of the hair on the head.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since if he cut all his hair at once he would be exempt, even if he cut the Pe'os first he is exempt (and it is permitted).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Torah does not permit this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Whenever one can fulfill both the Aseh and the Lav, he must. If not, the Aseh overrides the Lav. (Here, he can fulfill both by shaving the Pe'os last!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Rather, both forbid Hakafas Kol ha'Rosh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Tana #1 learns from "Rosho" that an Aseh overrides a Lav.) Tana #2 learns from "Rosho" that an Aseh overrides an Aseh and a Lav. He must know from elsewhere that an Aseh overrides a Lav. What is his source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from Tzitzis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Do not wear Sha'atnez (a mixture of wool and linen)", but "Gedilim Ta'aseh Lecha" (you may use Sha'atnez to fulfill the Mitzvah of Tzitzis).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He used that verse to teach Rava's law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "You will put on the threads the corner" - the threads are the same material as the corner of the garment;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> (Nearby, it says) "wool and linen together." This implies that the threads must be of wool or linen!</p>

<p class="bas bbbline">58b----------------------------------------58b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn in general because Isurei Kehunah are weak, for they are not Shavah b'Chol (they do not apply to all people).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Likewise, we cannot learn that the Aseh for a Metzora to shave overrides the Aseh and Lav of Nazir, for it is more severe than Isurei Kehunah. (It is Shavah b'Chol, for anyone can become a Nazir.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Tana #2 learns from "Rosho" that the Aseh overrides an Aseh and a Lav. What does he learn from "Zekano"?</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> "(Kohanim) will not shave their beards" - Perhaps they are liable even if they shave with scissors!</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Culmination of answer:</span> Since the Torah needed to permit a Metzora Kohen to shave his beard, this shows that the Mitzvah to shave must be with a Ta'ar).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Tana #1 learns from "Rosho" that an Aseh overrides a Lav. Why must the Torah write both "Rosho" and "Zekano"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>From "Zekano" alone we learn that the Aseh overrides a Lav (for a non-Kohen), as well as a Lav and an Aseh (for a Kohen)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn that a Kohen may shave his beard from a Nazir, since Isurei Nazir are weak, because a Nazir can annul his vow;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We cannot learn that a Nazir can shave his head from a Kohen, since the Isur of a Kohen is weak; it is not Shavah b'Chol.</p>
