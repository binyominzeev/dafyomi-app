<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IS SHAVING A <i>MITZVAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya):</span> Tiglachas Metzora cannot count for Tiglachas Nazir Tamei, for a Metzora shaves before immersing, and a Nazir Tamei shaves after immersing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tiglachas Metzora cannot count for the shaving of a Tahor Nazir, for a Metzora shaves before offering Korbanos. A Tamei Nazir shaves after Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Tiglachas Metzora...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> Are (all) four shavings Mitzvos, or (is the third) merely to remove hair (some of which grew while) Tamei?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is only to remove Tamei hair, a Ta'ar is not needed. A cream may be used to remove the hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava - Beraisa):</span> He shaves four times.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If (the third) shaving is only to remove Tamei hair, it would suffice to shave three times!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Even the third shaving is a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK HA'KUSIM</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHO MAY BECOME A <i>NAZIR</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Nezirus does not apply to Kusim. It does apply to women and slaves. <span class="note">(<span class="notewd">Note:</span> 'Kusim' were Nochrim who converted because they were being eaten by lions, but they observed only some Mitzvos and continued to serve idolatry. Here, Kusim refers to Nochrim. (The Rosh's text said explicitly says so.))</span></p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There is a stringency of women over slaves. One can force his slave to transgress Nezirus, but he cannot force his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source that Kusim cannot be Nezirim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa #1):</span> "Speak to Bnei Yisrael", not to Kusim. "And say to them" includes slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must a verse include slaves?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Every Mitzvah that applies to women applies to slaves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It says regarding vows "to forbid on one's soul." This refers to one who owns his own soul. This excludes slaves;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If not for a verse to include them, we would say that they also cannot accept Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> "Bnei Yisrael" - and not Kusim...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Sometimes the Torah says Bnei Yisrael, and we do not exclude Kusim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Erchin (vowing to give money to Hekdesh, based on a person's age and gender) it says Bnei Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Bnei Yisrael can vow to give a person's Erech, but Kusim cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one cannot vow to give the Erech of a Kusi!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "A man" (includes Kusim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Another verse excludes Kusim from Nezirus - "for his mother and father he will not be Metamei."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that Nezirus applies only to one who has a (Halachic) father; this excludes Kusim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It what sense does a Kusi not have a father?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He does not inherit his father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Chiya bar Avin taught that "I gave Mount Se'ir to Esav for an inheritance" teaches that a Kusi inherits his father mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He has no Mitzvah to honor his father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Parshas Nazir does not discuss honoring a father!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> "For his mother and father he will not be Metamei" - Nezirus applies only to one who can become Tamei. This excludes Kusim.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">61b----------------------------------------61b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Kusim cannot become Tamei?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "A man who will be Tamei and will not Metaher himself will be cut off from the congregation" - Tum'ah applies only to members of the congregation. This excludes Kusim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps Kares applies only to members of the congregation, but even others can become Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "The Tahor will sprinkle on the Tamei" - only one who can become Tahor can be Tamei! (Taharah through the red heifer is for "Bnei Yisrael.")</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps he can become Tamei, but he cannot become Tahor afterwards! (This verse is not extra. The coming verse is extra.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> "A man who will be Tamei and will not Metaher himself" (only one who can become Tahor can become Tamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Defense (of Answer #1 - Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> (Regarding Tum'as Nazir, the Torah discusses a father who bequeaths everything, even slaves - ) "You will bequeath (your slaves) to your children after you";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since a Kusi cannot inherit slaves from his father, Nezirus does not apply to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This should also teach that slaves cannot be Nezirim!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE DISTINCTION BETWEEM <i>ERCHIN</i> AND <i>NEZIRUS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to question 2:g - Rava):</span> Kusim are included regarding Erchin, but not regarding Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Bnei Yisrael" - Bnei Yisrael can be Ma'arich (vow to give a person's Erech), but Kusim cannot;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one cannot be Ma'arich a Kusi.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "A man" (includes Kusim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding Nezirus, "Bnei Yisrael" excludes Kusim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it excludes them only from bringing Korbanos Nezirus, but "a man" teaches that (Isurim of) Nezirus apply to them!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Another verse teaches that they do not bring Korbanos Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Glili):</span> "(A Kusi may offer) an Olah", but not Korbanos Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "Bnei Yisrael" excludes Kusim only from eternal Nezirus, and "a man" teaches that (regular) Nezirus applies to them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Eternal Nezirus is not written in the Torah. A verse would not come to exclude this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "Bnei Yisrael" teaches only that a Kusi cannot impose Nezirus on his son, and "a man" teaches that Nezirus applies to them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan taught that imposing Nezirus on one's son is tradition from Sinai. A verse would not come to exclude this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "Bnei Yisrael" teaches only that a Kusi cannot be Megale'ach (bring Korbanos Nazir, after his father died) from money that his father set aside for his own Gilu'ach, and "a man" teaches that Nezirus applies to them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan taught that Gilu'ach with the father's money is a tradition from Sinai. A verse would not come to exclude this.</p>
