<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A DOUBTFULLY <i>TAMEI</i> <i>NAZIR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rami bar Chama - Mishnah):</span> If a Nazir became Safek Tamei (Mes), and was a Safek Metzora Muchlat, he can eat Kodshim after 60 days, and can drink wine and be Metamei after 120 days. (He must shave twice for Safek Tzara'as, once for Safek Nazir Tamei, and once for Nezirus Taharah. Each time he must wait 30 days before shaving, lest he is now a Nazir Tahor.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This applies to a 30 day Nezirus. If he accepted Nezirus for one year, (he must wait a year each time, so) he can eat Kodshim after two years, and drink wine and be Metamei after four years.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If days of Tzara'as counted towards Nezirus, he would be able to drink wine and be Metamei after three years and 30 days (the third shaving could be 30 days after the second)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Question #3 (Rav Ashi - Beraisa). We know that days of Tum'ah (Tum'as Mes) do not count towards Nezirus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that days of Muchlat do not count?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> When he becomes Tamei, he must shave and bring Korbanos. The same applies to a Metzora Muchlat. Just like days of Tum'ah do not count, also days of Muchlat!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from days of Tum'ah. They are more stringent, for they cancel previous days, unlike a Muchlat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn a Kal v'Chomer from one who accepted Nezirus while Tamei (Mes);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>His hair is fitting to be shaved for Nezirus (Taharah, for Tiglachas Tum'ah is only for one who was Tahor and became Tamei), yet his days of Tum'ah do not count. All the more so, the days of a Muchlat, whose hair will not be shaved for Nezirus (rather, for Tzara'as), do not count!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the seven days of Sefirah (after the Tzara'as goes away) do not count towards Nezirus?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">56b----------------------------------------56b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Just like he must shave after Tzara'as Muchlat, also after Sefirah. Just like the former days do not count towards Nezirus, also the latter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this should also apply to days of Hesger (a Metzora before a Siman of absolute Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A Muchlat makes a Kli (intended to sit or lie on it) an Av ha'Tum'ah (the Kli can be Metamei people and Kelim) by sitting on it, also a Musgar;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Just like days of Muchlat do not count towards Nezirus, we should say the same about days of Hesger!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. A Muchlat must shave and bring a Korban, therefore his days do not count. These do not apply to a Musgar, so his days count!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Days of Muchlat and Sefirah do not count towards Nezirus, but days of a Zav, Zavah or Musgar do count!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> The Beraisa said that days of Tum'ah cancel previous days, unlike a Muchlat.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the case is a short Nezirus, he must grow 30 days of hair after Taharah from Tzara'as (so previous days would be lost)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Rather, it is a long Nezirus, and the Beraisa says that the days of Muchlat do not count! (Rav Chisda is refuted.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SHAVING AND ENTERING THE <i>MIKDASH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar, citing R. Yehoshua):</span> If one became Tamei in a way that requires a Nazir to shave, he gets Kares if he enters the Mikdash. If he became Tamei (Mes) in a way that does not requires a Nazir to shave, he is exempt for Bi'as Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Meir says, the latter Tum'os are no more lenient than touching a Sheretz, and one who did so gets Kares for Bi'as Mikdash!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> R. Elazar did not learn this from R. Yehoshua, rather from R. Yehoshua bar Mamal!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> I heard R. Yehoshua ben Pasar Rosh say that one is liable for Bi'as Mikdash only for those Tum'os of Mes for which a Nazir shaves. R. Meir replied, even those for which he does not shave are no more lenient than Tum'as Sheretz, for which one is liable for Bi'as Mikdash'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar (to R. Yehoshua ben Pasar Rosh):</span> Are you familiar with R. Yehoshua bar Mamal?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Pasar Rosh:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> I received from him like you said, and he received it from R. Yehoshua.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that when a teaching was transmitted through three (or more) Chachamim, it suffices to mention the first and last.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> A Mishnah also teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Nachum ha'Lavlar):</span> If one plants dill and mustard in two or three places, he must leave Pe'ah (a corner of the field for the poor) from each. I received this law from R. Miyosha, and he from my father, and he from the pairs (the Nasi and head of the Beis Din), and they from the Nevi'im, and they from Moshe who received this on Sinai.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He did not mention Yehoshua and Kalev. This shows that one may omit intermediate steps in the chain.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE DOES NOT SHAVE FOR A <i>REVI'IS</i> OF BLOOD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> A bone k'Se'orah is not Metamei Tum'as Ohel, yet a Nazir shaves for touching or moving it. A Revi'is of blood is Metamei b'Ohel, all the more so a Nazir should shave for touching or moving it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> No, you cannot make a Kal v'Chomer from a tradition from Sinai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> R. Akiva would be correct (Gra - normally, we can make a Kal v'Chomer from a tradition), but here the tradition opposes it.</p>
