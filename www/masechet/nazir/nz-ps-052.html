<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>AN INCOMPLETE ANT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> (A tradition obligates one who eats a Briyah (a creation), even if it is less than a k'Zayis.) If one ate an incomplete ant, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does the tradition apply only to a complete creation?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does it apply to an amount that could live?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Answer (Rav Yehudah of Diskarta - Beraisa) Suggestion: "(One who touches) ba'Hem (becomes Tamei)" - perhaps only a complete Sheretz (rodent) is Metamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "(If will fall) from them (into a oven, everything inside becomes Tamei)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps even part of one is Metamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "ba'Hem"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> One is Tamei if he touches an amount equal to a full Sheretz. Chachamim estimated that this is the size of a lentil, which is the size of a Chomet (snail or lizard) when it is created.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Summation of answer:</span> We require a full creation. (Surely, a Chomet could live even if a small amount was cut off. Nevertheless, we require the Shi'ur of a full Chomet!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Shemayah):</span> Less than the size of a lentil is not important for Tum'ah, for a soul never enters a Sheretz of this size. Something that was alive is important, even if it is missing something not vital to life! (Tosfos; Rashi - this applies only to Sheratzim, for a soul does not enter a Sheretz smaller than a lentil. A soul enters an ant smaller than a lentil, so the question remains.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>TUM'AH</i> OF THE SPINE AND SKULL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The spine and skull (have Tum'as Ohel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does this mean that together they are Metamei (b'Ohel), or each is by itself?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava - Beraisa):</span> If most of the ribs (the Rambam's text reads 'vertebrae') of the spine were broken, it is Tahor. If it is in a casket, even if they were broken or detached, it is Tamei, because the casket (joins them).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A whole spine is Tamei by itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. The Beraisa says that if most of the ribs are broken, the spine lost its Tum'ah. Perhaps the spine is Tamei only when it is with the skull!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> There were six things that R. Akiva was Metamei, and Chachamim argued, and R. Akiva retracted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A case occurred in which a box of bones was brought into the synagogue of Tarsiyim (coppersmiths, weavers, or people from Tarsus). Tudus and other doctors said that there was not a (full) spine from one person.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If there were a spine or skull of one person, a Nazir would shave due to it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the doctors said that the bones were not even close to having Tum'as Ohel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Not only was there not a spine and skull of one person, there was not even a spine or skull of one person!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa):</span> There are six things that R. Akiva was Metamei and Chachamim were Metaher. <span class="note">(<span class="notewd">Note:</span> the previous Beraisa (Tosefta Ohalos 4:2) does not list the six things. Rashi and the Rosh explicitly say that we cite a Beraisa that lists them.)</span> They are:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A limb from two Mesim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A limb from two living people;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A half Kav of bones from two Mesim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A Revi'is of blood from two Mesim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>A bone k'Se'orah that was divided into two pieces;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>A spine and skull from two Mesim.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">52b----------------------------------------52b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> They are Metamei only together. If a spine or skull were Tamei by itself, R. Akiva would be Metamei seven things!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> The Beraisa lists only things about which the majority argued with R. Akiva. This excludes a bone k'Se'orah, for only an individual disagrees with this:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> If a bone k'Se'orah was divided into two pieces, it is Tamei,</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan ben Nuri is Metaher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> The Beraisa lists only things from a Mes, not (a limb) from a Chai. (Rashi - the correct text of the Beraisa omits this; Rosh - both are counted like one.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #3:</span> The Beraisa lists only things for which a Nazir shaves due to their Tum'as Ohel. It omits a bone k'Se'orah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #4:</span> The Beraisa lists only things about which R. Akiva later retracted. It omits a Revi'is of blood, for R. Akiva never retracted about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> Do not list a Revi'is of blood among the matters about which R. Akiva retracted, for his source was not refuted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Further, the verse supports him - "On the souls of any Mes he will not come."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> In his life, R. Akiva never retracted. I do not know whether or not he retracted after he died.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>For speaking about his Rebbi in this (jesting) manner, R. Shimon fasted so often that his teeth turned black.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Beraisa):</span> Beis Shamai say that a quarter Kav taken from two or three bones (has Tum'as Ohel);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel say, a quarter Kav from bones comprising the majority of the stature or number of bones has (Tum'as Ohel).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> We can reconcile the opinions of Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Beis Shamai discuss two or three bones, i.e. are two shins (they count only like one, since they are thin) and one thigh, or two thighs and one shin. These comprise the majority of the stature,</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Beis Hillel include a quarter Kav from bones comprising the majority of the number of bones, e.g. the (120) bones in the fingers and toes (and five more, e.g. from the ankle. Beis Shamai agree, just they did not mention this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Shamai says, even from one bone of the spine or skull (has Tum'as Ohel).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Each is Metamei by itself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot bring a proof from Shamai, for he is more stringent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Only Shamai, who is stringent, says that either imparts Tum'ah by itself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps Chachamim argue only about one bone from the spine or skull, but they agree that if either is intact, it is Metamei.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BONES FROM THE SPINE OR SKULL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> Does Tum'as Ohel of a quarter Kav of bones from the spine or skull obligate a Nazir to shave?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah said that he shaves for half a Kav. Perhaps this applies only to other bones, which are less stringent!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps the same amount applies to bones of the spine or skull.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava - Mishnah):</span> (He shaves for) the spine and skull.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they were more stringent, the Mishnah should have said that a quarter Kav suffices! (The Mishnah connotes that they are intact. We are assuming that every spine and skull exceeds a quarter Kav.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> But Rava himself said (to explain a Mishnah) 'this teaches about a spine or skull less than the volume of a quarter Kav'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava said that after hearing R. Akiva's opinion (before this, he assumed that every spine and skull exceeds a quarter Kav).</p>
