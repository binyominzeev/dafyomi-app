<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IS ONE LASHED FOR A <i>LAV</i> <i>SHEBI'CHLALOS</i>? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav Papa's question was based on the fact that the Beraisa says five!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> I thought that Abaye had no tradition for his law (but rather relied on his own reasoning. I falsified the Beraisa to see if he would retract if a Beraisa apparently opposed him);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When I saw that he did not retract (but rather gave a flimsy answer to defend himself), I realized that he had a tradition.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Eliezer ben Azaryah says...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Unkelos' translation of "from Chartzanim to Zag" is like R. Yosi (who says that Chartzanim are pits and Zag is the skin).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IF A <i>NAZIR'S</i> HAIR WAS CUT DURING <i>NEZIRUS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Stam Nezirus is 30 days. If he shaved or was shaved by bandits (before completion), this nullifies 30 days (most Rishonim - this obligates him to observe 30 days of Nezirus after shaving);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a Nazir shaved, whether with scissors or a Ta'ar (razor), or plucked out even one hair, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Do hairs grow from the bottom (the scalp) or from the top (the end of the hair)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If bandits shaved a Nazir, and they left the hairs long enough to fold a hair onto its root:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If hairs grow from the bottom, they cut off all the hair he had when he accepted Nezirus (he must let his hair grow 30 more days before he can shave and end his Nezirus);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If hairs grow from the top, there are remnants of his hair at the time he accepted, so he may shave and end Nezirus without delay (as if he was not shaved).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Lice eggs prove that hairs grow from the top.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They are always found attached to hairs near the roots. If hairs grew from the roots, older eggs would be further from the scalp!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, hairs grow from the roots. There is life inside the eggs, and they slide their way back to the roots.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Dead lice eggs prove that hairs grow from the bottom</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some are found attached to hairs far from the roots. If hairs grew from the top, all would remain at the scalp (like they were when alive)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, hairs grow from the top. Since there is no life inside the eggs, they slide down [away from the roots, closer to the ground].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> We learn from idolaters who braid their hair that hairs grow from the bottom. Over time, the braiding becomes lax (because there is more hair from the scalp to the knot than initially)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, hairs grow from the top. When they sleep, they lie on their hair, and this softens the braiding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> We learn from dye put on the wool of animals that hairs grow from the bottom. This proof is based on something learned in a Mishnah (when tithing one's animals, one dyes each tenth animal).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5:</span> We can also prove this from old people who dye their beards (black). The part of the hair near the roots is white!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If bandits shaved a Nazir, and they left the hairs long enough to fold back onto the roots, this does not nullify the days of Nezirus he has kept.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If hairs grow from the bottom, he should need to observe 30 more days!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, they shaved him after he finished his term of Nezirus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa is like R. Eliezer, who says that if he became Tamei at that time, he would need to wait only seven days;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer learns the law of a Tahor Nazir from a Tamei Nazir. Just like a Tamei Nazir waits only seven days, also a Tahor Nazir need wait only until he has seven days' growth of hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim know that in seven days a hair grows long enough to fold it onto its root.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT CONSTITUTES SHAVING?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Nazir shaved with scissors or a Ta'ar, or plucked out even one hair, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Yoshiyah) Question:</span> It says "a Ta'ar (will not pass over his head)." What is the source that a Nazir is liable even for pulling out hairs or parts of hairs?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He will be Kodesh; he will grow the hair of his head."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yonasan says, one is liable only for a Ta'ar. One is exempt for pulling out hairs or parts of hairs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it says "He will be Kodesh..."!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that if he shaves with a Ta'ar, he transgresses a Lav and an Aseh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2) Question:</span> It says "Ta'ar." What is the source that a Nazir is liable even for pulling out hairs or parts of hairs?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "Will not pass over his head."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since one is liable for all methods of removing hair, why did the Torah specify a Ta'ar?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it is not needed to teach about the Isur of shaving during Nezirus, it is used to teach that upon finishing Nezirus, he must shave with a Ta'ar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We could not learn this from a Metzora (who shaves with a Ta'ar), since a Metzora is more stringent (he shaves all the hair on his body).</p>
