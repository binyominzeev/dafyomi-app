<p class="dedicationbox">NAZIR 42 (20 Tishrei) - Dedicated by Al and Sophia Ziegler of Har Nof, Jerusalem, and their son Jared, in loving memory of Al's mother, Chaya bas Berel Dov Ziegler, on the day of her Yahrzeit - and towards the continued growth in Torah and Yir'as Shamayim of her grandson Jared and his family. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE MAJORITY IS LIKE THE WHOLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If he (a Levi, Metzora or Nazir) shaved without a Ta'ar, or left two hairs, he was not Yotzei (he did not fulfill the Mitzvah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> This shows that the Torah considers the majority to be like the whole.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we infer this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says regarding Nazir "he will shave it" (the entire head). Here, the whole is required. Elsewhere else, the majority is like the whole.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> This verse discusses a Tamei Nazir!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> We learn that a Nazir Tamei must shave with a Ta'ar from a Nazir Tahor. Likewise, we can learn from a Nazir Tamei that if a Nazir Tahor left two hairs, he was not Yotzei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If a Nazir shaved and left two hairs, and his hair grew (to the size to bend a hair onto its root), and he shaved them (Rashi - and all his hair), was he Yotzei?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If a Nazir shaved and left two hairs, and he shaved one of them, and the other fell out, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Acha from Difti):</span> Does Rava ask about one who shaves one hair at a time? (Of course he is Yotzei!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Rava asked about if one of the two remaining hairs fell out, and he shaved the last hair. What is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> He did not fulfill the Mitzvah to shave; no hair remains.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If there is no hair left, he was Yotzei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, even though no hair remains, he was not Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>UNINTENTIONAL REMOVAL OF HAIR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Nazir may rub (shampoo) his hair, and may separate the hairs, but he may not comb his hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Which Tana permits rubbing and separating hairs?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Shimon, who permits Davar she'Eino Miskaven (something unintended that may result in a transgression).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa forbids combing. This is like Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is the Reisha R. Shimon, and the Seifa is Chachamim?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> The entire Mishnah is like R. Shimon. One who combs intends to uproot dangling strands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yishmael):</span> He may not shampoo with earth, because it causes hair to fall out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the Mishnah read 'because it makes hair fall out', or 'because of that (kind of earth) that makes hair to fall out'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>These texts differ about earth that does not make hair fall out.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the text is 'because it makes hair fall out', if we know that this earth does not, it is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If the text is 'because of that which makes hair fall out', it is always forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MULTIPLE LASHES FOR MULTIPLE TRANSGRESSIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Nazir drank wine all day, he is liable only once (one set of lashes). If they warned him 'don't drink, don't drink' and he drank, he is liable for each warning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he was shaving all day, he is liable only once. If they warned him 'don't shave, don't shave' and he shaved, he is liable for each warning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he was being Metamei (exposing himself to Tum'as Mes) all day, he is liable only once. If they warned him 'don't be Metamei, don't be Metamei and he was Metamei, he is liable for each warning.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">42b----------------------------------------42b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rabah citing Rav Huna):</span> The Torah says "he will not be Metamei (become Tamei)", and also "he will not enter (Ohel ha'Mes, a tent in which there is a Mes)." It discusses all situations (even if he is already Tamei, he is liable for entering Ohel ha'Mes);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is not lashed twice for Tum'ah twice if the latter Tum'ah is not via an Ohel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I swear, Rav Huna said that even for touching twice, he is liable twice!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If a Nazir was in a cemetery and they passed his (dead) relative or any Mes to him, and he touched it, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even though he is already Tamei, Rav Huna obligates him for touching Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> If a Kohen was carrying a Mes and they passed his relative or any Mes to him, and he touched it, perhaps he is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "He will not profane" (most change the text to "to profane himself"). The Torah does not discuss one who is already profaned (Tamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rav Yosef - Mishnah):</span> If he was being Metamei all day, he is liable only once. If they warned him 'don't be Metamei, don't be Metamei' and he was Metamei, he is liable for each warning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though he is already Tamei, he is liable for touching Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Tosfos):</span> Since the Beraisa opposes the Mishnah, there must be a mistake in the text, so we reject the Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> In the Beraisa, there is no separation between the Tum'os (he was still touching the first Mes when he touched the second). In the Mishnah, they are separated.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rosh):</span> This is unlike the Mishnah! (Rav Yosef asks rhetorically, how do we resolve this?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> In the Beraisa, there is no separation between the Tum'os. In the Mishnah, they are separated. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Connected Tum'ah is not mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> Connected Tum'ah applies only to Terumah and Kodshim. It does not apply to a Nazir or to one who offers Korban Pesach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it was mid'Oraisa, it would apply in all cases!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If Reuven touched a person who is touching a person touching a Mes, he is Tamei for seven days mid'Rabanan. If he touched a person touching a Mes, he is Tamei for seven days mid'Oraisa (Tosfos. Rashi - if he touched a person who is no longer touching a Mes, Reuven is Tamei for seven days mid'Rabanan. If he touched a person touching a Mes, he is Tamei for seven days mid'Oraisa.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If while touching a Mes, he touches another Mes, he is not liable for the latter, because he is already Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The same applies if he enters Ohel ha'Mes (a room containing a Mes) while he is Tamei (and Rabah obligates in this case)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> If the Mes is in a house, he becomes Tamei at the moment he enters, so he is liable for becoming Tamei and for entering;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Mes is in a field, he becomes Tamei when he touches it. Even if he later enters Ohel ha'Mes, since he is already Tamei when he enters, he is exempt for entering.</p>
