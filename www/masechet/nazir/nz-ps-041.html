<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A <i>METZORA</i> MUST SHAVE WITH A <i>TA'AR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> If he fulfills his Mitzvah with a Melaket or Rehitani, since the Torah did not specify Ta'ar, Reish Lakish's law would forbid him to use a Ta'ar! (This argues with Answer #1.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Wherever one can fulfill the Aseh and the Lav, he must. If not, the Aseh overrides the Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Eliezer learn that a Metzora shaves with a Ta'ar?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from "Rosho":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "A Ta'ar will not pass over Rosho (of a Nazir)" applies even if he is a Metzora!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "(He shaves) Rosho" (even if he is a Nazir).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps a Metzora can fulfill his Mitzvah also with a Melaket or Rehitani!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Rosho" comes to teach that he is allowed to shave with a Ta'ar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One would have thought that a Nazir is liable for shaving with a Ta'ar, even when he is a Metzora. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he fulfills his Mitzvah with a Melaket or Rehitani, since the Torah did not specify Ta'ar - Reish Lakish's law would teach that he may not use a Ta'ar!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW THE OTHER VERSE IS EXPOUNDED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim learn from "Rosho"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that Tiglachas Metzora overrides the Lav of cutting the Pe'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Lo Sakifu Pe'as Roshchem (do not round the corners of your heads, i.e. cutting the Pe'os)" applies even to a Metzora!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "(A Metzora shaves) Rosho."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Torah need to write "Rosho"? We could learn from "Zekano" (that an Aseh overrides a Lav)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "(Kohanim) will not shave the corners of their beards" applies even to a Metzora!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "(A Metzora will shave) Zekano" (even if he is a Kohen).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Why are both "Rosho" and "Zekano" needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the Torah written only "Zekano", one might have thought that Hakafah (the Isur to cut the Pe'os) does not apply when one cuts all his hair. Therefore, it says "Rosho";</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">41b----------------------------------------41b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Had the Torah written only "Rosho", we would have learned two laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An Aseh overrides a Lav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Hakafah applies when one cuts all his hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We would not learn that a Metzora must shave with a Ta'ar. Therefore, "Zekano" is also needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Eliezer's source that an Aseh overrides a Lav?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from Tzitzis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Do not wear Sha'atnez", but "Gedilim Ta'aseh Lecha" (you may use Sha'atnez to fulfill the Mitzvah of Tzitzis).</p>
