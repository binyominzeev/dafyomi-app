<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO ACCEPTS PARTIAL <i>NEZIRUS </i>(cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is wine of a Mitzvah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is wine of Kidush and Havdalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Torah does not require one to drink wine for Kidush and Havdalah! (This is only mid'Rabanan!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> He swore to drink wine, then accepted Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Nezirus takes effect, and he may not drink wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim should agree that "wine and strong drink" comes to forbid wine of a Mitzvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We can learn that from "wine" alone; "And strong drink" teaches that it suffices to accept one Isur of Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Shimon learn from "and strong drink"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He learns a Gezeirah Shavah to "wine and strong drink" written regarding the Isur to serve in the Mikdash when drunk.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a Nazir may not drink wine, but he is permitted other intoxicating drinks, also a Kohen may not serve after drinking wine, but may serve after other intoxicating drinks. This is unlike R. Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If one ate figs of Ke'ilis and drank honey or milk and entered the Mikdash, he is liable (to death at the hands of Heaven).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Shimon holds that is something is already forbidden, a second Isur does not take effect on it. (Rosh - he learns this from "and strong drink." Tosfos - he uses "and strong drink" to teach that Nezirus adds an Isur to wine that is already forbidden.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> If one eats on Yom Kipur an animal that died (before Yom Kipur) without slaughter, he is exempt (from Kares. The Isur to eat on Yom Kipur does not take effect on a Neveilah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim learn from "All that is made from the grapevine"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that all foods forbidden to a Nazir combine to obligate lashes for eating a k'Zayis (the volume of an olive).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Shimon, this does not apply;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> One is lashed for eating any amount of a food forbidden by a Lav. The Shi'ur of a k'Zayis is relevant only to the Chiyuv to bring a Korban (for foods forbidden by Kares. This does not apply to Nezirus.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>NEZIRUS</i> SHIMSHON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I am like Shimshon, like Mano'ach's son, like Delilah's husband', 'like the one who uprooted the doors of Azah' or 'like the one whose eyes were gouged out by the Pelishtim', he is a Nazir Shimshon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why must all of these be taught?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it taught only 'I am like Shimshon', one might have thought that he refers to another Shimshon. Therefore, it adds 'like Mano'ach's son';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Like Mano'ach's son' does not suffice, for perhaps another man has that name. Therefore, he needs to add 'like Delilah's husband' or 'like the one whose eyes were gouged out by the Pelishtim.' (Any expression other than 'like Shimshon' and 'like Mano'ach's son' suffices by itself.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> What is the difference between a Nazir Olam and a Nazir Shimshon? A Nazir Olam may lighten his hair with a Ta'ar (razor) when it is too long, and then he brings three animals (Korbanos Nazir). If he became Tamei, he brings Korbanos Nazir Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A Nazir Shimshon cannot cut his hair, even if it is long. If he becomes Tamei, he does not bring Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Nazir Olam was not mentioned before! (It should be mentioned before we ask how it is different from a Nazir Shimshon!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated. It means thusly: If one said 'I am a Nazir Olam', he is a Nazir Olam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is the difference between a Nazir Olam and a Nazir Shimshon? A Nazir Olam may lighten his hair with a Ta'ar when it is too long, and he brings three animals. If he became Tamei, he brings Korban Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Nazir Shimshon cannot cut his hair, even if it is long. If he becomes Tamei, he does not bring Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">4b----------------------------------------4b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He does not bring Korbanos for Tum'ah, but he may not become Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah is not like R. Yehudah, nor like R. Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> A Nazir Shimshon may become Tamei through a Mes, like we find that Shimshon did;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, acceptance to be a Nazir Shimshon has no effect. We do not find that Shimshon verbally accepted Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Mishnah is unlike R. Yehudah, who permits a Nazir Shimshon to become Tamei. It is unlike R. Shimon, who says that a person cannot become a Nazir Shimshon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, it is like R. Yehudah; he may become Tamei l'Chatchilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since it says regarding a Nazir Olam 'if he became Tamei' (b'Di'eved), the same expression was used regarding a Nazir Shimshon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yehudah and R. Shimon argue like the following Tana'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Yakov):</span> If one said 'this is forbidden to me like a Bechor (a firstborn male animal', which is a Korban), the vow takes effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi permits (the vow is void).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yehudah holds like R. Yakov, who says that Hatfasah (making 'A' forbidden like 'B') need not be in Davar ha'Nadur (something forbidden by a vow. Rather, it works even if 'B' is Davar ha'Asur, i.e. the Torah forbade it.) R. Shimon holds like R. Yosi, that Hatfasah must be in Davar ha'Nadur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all require Hatfasah in Davar ha'Nadur. R. Yakov expounds "To Hash-m" (in the verse of vowing) to allow Hatfasah in a Bechor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi expounds "To Hash-m" to allow Hatfasah in a Chatas or Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Yosi expound to allow Hatfasah in a Chatas or Asham, and not in a Bechor?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Man was Makdish a Chatas and Asham, but not a Bechor (it is is automatically Hekdesh from birth);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yakov holds that man is Makdish also a Bechor;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Rabeinu):</span> "You will be Makdish the male" is a Mitzvah to be Makdish a Bechor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi agrees that there is a Mitzvah to proclaim its Kedushah. However, it is Kodesh even without this (therefore, it is not Davar ha'Nadur).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding Nazir, it also says "to Hash-m!" (R. Shimon should agree that this comes to include Nazir Shimshon!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He expounds "to Hash-m" like Shimon ha'Tzadik:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Shimon ha'Tzadik):</span> In all my days, I only ate from one Asham of a Nazir Tamei. The man was beautiful, especially his hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Shimon ha'Tzadik:</span> Why did you become a Nazir, which requires you to cut off your beautiful hair?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">The Nazir:</span> I saw my reflection, and my evil inclination was obsessed with my beauty. It threatened to destroy me! I countered 'do not pride yourself with a world that is not yours. The body stands to become worms! I will shave off this hair to Hash-m (by becoming a Nazir)!'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Shimon ha'Tzadik kissed him. 'There should be more Nezirim like you. You fulfill "One who will vow to be a Nazir to Hash-m"!'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT KIND OF <i>NAZIR</i> WAS SHIMSHON?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, all agree that Shimshon was a Nazir (through a vow)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"The youth will be a Nazir to Hash-m from the womb"! (Rosh - we are thinking that Shimshon accepted Nezirus when he matured, or that his father imposed Nezirus on him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the angel himself imposed Nezirus on him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Shimshon became Tamei Mes?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from "I killed 1000 men with the jawbone of a donkey." (The Rosh says that we could not learn a Heter Tum'ah from here. Here he was permitted for Piku'ach Nefesh (they wanted to kill him)! Perhaps the questioner assumed that after he killed several hundred, the Pelishtim tried to flee, and he was not in danger.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps he threw it at them, but did not touch them, and never became Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from "he smote 30 men and took their garments."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he took the garments before killing them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says that he hit them before taking their garments.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps they did not die from the blow, they just became close to death!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (c)):</span> Rather, we know this from a tradition.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A NAZIR OLAM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for a Nazir Olam [to shave and offer Korbanos when his hair gets long]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Avshalom was a Nazir Olam - "at the end of 40 years, Avshalom said to the king 'I will go to fulfill what I vowed to Hash-m, in Chevron.'"</p>
