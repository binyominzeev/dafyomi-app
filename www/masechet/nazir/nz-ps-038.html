<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN FOODS JOIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon holds that there is no need for foods to join (he obligates for eating any amount). What does he learn from "all that comes from the grapevine"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that one must accept all the Isurim in order to become a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu citing R. Eliezer):</span> The only case in which one is liable for consuming a Revi'is and Heter joins with Isur is a Nazir, for it says "Mishras".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the teachings of R. Eliezer and R. Yochanan (35b, the only case in which Heter joins with Isur is Isurei Nazir)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan teaches that even solid foods combine. R. Eliezer teaches only that liquids join.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE <i>SHI'UR</i> OF A <i>REVI'IS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> The Shi'ur of a Revi'is applies to 10 laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> Five apply to red liquids, and five apply to white liquids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A Siman (way to remember) the red liquids is 'a Nazir and one doing the Pesach, who gave rulings in the Mikdash and died':'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Nazir - he is liable for drinking a Revi'is of wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Pesach - (Rav Yehudah):</span> (Each of) the four cups of wine must be at least a Revi'is.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Who gave rulings - one who drank a Revi'is of wine may not rule about Halachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>In the Mikdash - if one drank a Revi'is of wine and entered the Mikdash, he is liable to death (at the hands of Heaven).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">And died - (Beraisa):</span> "Upon all souls of a Mes he will not come" teaches that a Revi'is of blood from two Mesim is Metamei the room.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A Siman to remember the white liquids is 'the Chalah of a Nazir and a Metzora that became Pasul on Shabbos';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chalah - a Revi'is of oil is used in each Chalah of the Kohen Gadol's daily Minchah offering (Rashi; Tosfos - for the loaves and wafers in a Korban Todah. Another Revi'is is used for the fried flour offering.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Nazir - a Revi'is of oil is used for the loaves and wafers of a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Metzora - a bird is slaughtered and its blood is spilled into a Revi'is of water.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>That became Pasul - one who drinks a Revi'is of (any combination of) Tamei liquids is disqualified from eating Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Shabbos - (Mishnah):</span> If one takes a Revi'is of any other liquids (for which the Mishnah did not other Shi'urim) or waste water from a Reshus ha'Yachid to a Reshus ha'Rabim, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Questions:</span> There are also others!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> One person, or even two, may wash his hands from a Revi'is of water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer did not count laws about which Tana'im argued. (R. Yosi requires that a Revi'is remain before the last person washes.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> An earthenware Kli was taken for a Sotah, and a half Log of water was put in it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, a Revi'is was put in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer did not count laws about which Tana'im argued.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If one puts any amount of water into urine, one may pray near it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Zakai requires a Revi'is.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer did not count laws about which Tana'im argued.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One may immerse Kelim in a Mikvah that contains a Revi'is of water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim abolished that law (and require 40 Sa'im).</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LIABILITY FOR GRAPES AND WINE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One is liable only for eating a k'Zayis of grapes...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The initial version of the Mishnah (obligated for a Revi'is of wine. It) did (not - Rosh deletes this from the text) equate all Isurim of a Nazir (i.e. eating) to drinking;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva expounds "and wet or dry grapes he will not eat" (written after the Isur of wine). Just like one is liable for eating a k'Zayis, also for drinking a k'Zayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One is liable for wine by itself...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "And wet or dry grapes he will not eat" obligates for each Isur by itself;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>From this we learn to all Isurim in the Torah (Tosfos' text - all Isurim of a Nazir). Whenever there are two names for Isurim within one species, one is liable for each;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This comes to include new wine (grape juice) and grapes (even though they have the same taste).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>IS ONE LASHED FOR A <i>LAV</i> <i>SHEBI'CHLALOS</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> One is lashed twice (two sets of 39 lashes) for eating grape pits. One is lashed twice for grape skins, and three times for eating both grape pits and skins;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> He is only lashed once (for each (pits and skins). Some texts include these words; most Rishonim learn this way even according to our text), but one is not lashed for Lav shebi'Chelalos (a Lav that encompasses different Isurim, e.g. "all that is made from the grapevine").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa, against Abaye - Beraisa):</span> If a Nazir drank wine all day, he is lashed only once. If they warned him 'don't drink, don't drink' and he drank, he is lashed once for each warning;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he ate wet and dry grapes, grape pits and skins, and squeezed a cluster of grapes and drank the juice, he is lashed five times.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Abaye, he should be lashed also for "all that is made from the grapevine", six times in all!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Tana did not list all the lashes he receives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He would not omit just one thing. What other lashes did he omit?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He omitted lashes for "Lo Yachel Devaro (he will not profane his word." Tosfos - this arouses a question: according to Rava, what else was omitted?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "He will not make his word profane" is not an omission. The Tana lists only Isurim special to a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina from Parzika):</span> The Isur on the inside of the grapes (Rashi; Tosfos - small grapes that never ripen) was omitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Rav Papa):</span> Really, the Beraisa does not say hold as many times he is lashed.</p>
