<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHY BOTH FATHER AND MOTHER MUST BE WRITTEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>According to R. Akiva, "for his brother" teaches that a regular Kohen Gadol, and even a Kohen Gadol Nazir, may be Metamei for a Mes Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the Torah write both "for his father" and "for his mother"? (We ask regarding Nazir and regarding Kohen Gadol.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the Torah written only "for his father", one might have thought that he may not be Metamei for his father (about whom we are unsure; perhaps his mother became pregnant from another man), for only a Chazakah says that it is his father (most Bi'os of a woman are with her husband);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, he could be Metamei for his mother, since we know that it is his mother!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Had the Torah written only "for his mother", one might have thought that he may not be Metamei for his mother, because lineage is not traced from the mother, but he could be Metamei for his father, since lineage comes from the father!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah wrote both, to forbid Tum'ah for either of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need "he will not come on any dead souls"?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">49b----------------------------------------49b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "On any" forbids (Tum'ah for) strangers. "Dead" forbids relatives. "Souls" forbids a Revi'is of blood that came from two Mesim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FOR WHICH <i>TUM'OS</i> MUST A <i>NAZIR</i> SHAVE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Nazir must shave (Tiglachas Tum'ah) if he became Tamei from any of the following:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Mes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A k'Zayis of a Mes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A k'Zayis of Netzel (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A spoon's worth of a decayed Mes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>A spine and (or) skull;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>A limb that separated from the body, in his life or after death, with sufficient flesh on it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>Half a Kav of bones;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>Half a Log of blood;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he touched, moved or was in a tent with any of these, he must shave;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>If he touches or moves a bone k'Se'orah (the size of a barley seed), he must shave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>For any of these, he shaves, they sprinkle on him (water with ashes of the red heifer) on days three and seven, and days observed until now are cancelled;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He does not restart Nezirus Taharah until he becomes Tahor. (It is clear from 54a that the words 'and brings Korbanos' must be deleted from the text.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> After R. Meir's death, R. Yehudah told his Talmidim 'don't let Talmidim of R. Meir into the Beis Medrash. They don't want to learn, they just want to refute me.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sumchus pushed his way in and said 'R. Meir taught that a Nazir must shave for the following - a Mes; a k'Zayis of a Mes...'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah (angrily):</span> Why did you let him in?! You see he is just causing problems! If a Nazir shaves for a k'Zayis of a Mes, there is no need to teach a (full) Mes!</p>
