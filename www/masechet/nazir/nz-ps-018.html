<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN DOES A <i>TAMEI</i> <i>NAZIR</i> SHAVE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (for rejection):</span> Presumably, this is correct. If it meant that he will shave like a Tamei Nazir (to remove the hair and allow Nezirus Taharah to begin), a Muchlat also shaves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. It means that the former's hair will be shaved for Nezirus, but a Muchlat's hair will (be  shaved due to Tzara'as, it will) not be shaved for Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Beraisa):</span> "And the Nazir's head became Tamei" discusses a Tahor Nazir who became Tamei. He must shave and bring (Korbanos of) birds. It exempts one who was Tamei from the start from shaving and birds.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal v'Chomer should obligate him. One who was Tahor and became Tamei must shave and bring birds, all the more so, one who was Tamei from the start!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "And the Nazir's head became Tamei" discusses a Tahor who became Tamei. He shaves and brings birds, but one who was Tamei from the start does not.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN DOES <i>NEZIRUS</i> <i>TAHARAH</i> BEGIN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the following Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The only difference between a Tamei who accepted Nezirus and a Tahor Nazir who became Tamei, is that the former counts the seventh day of becoming Tahor towards the term of Nezirus, but the latter does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is Rebbi, who says that Nezirus Taharah does not start until day eight. It is unlike R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah, who holds that it starts on day seven:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "He will sanctify his head on that day" refers to the day he brings his Korbanos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, it refers to the day he shaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the following Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Nazir became Tamei several times, he brings only one Korban (i.e. one set of Korbanos Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is R. Yosi (b'Rebbi Yehudah), who says that Nezirus Taharah begins on day seven.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case of one Korban for several Tum'os is when he became Tamei on day seven, and again on day seven.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since he became Tamei before he could bring his Korban, he brings only one.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Rebbi, if he became Tamei on day seven, and again on day seven, this is like one long Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he became Tamei on day eight, and again on day eight, since this was after he was able to bring his Korban, he would need to bring a Korban for each Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rebbi's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Immediately after "he will atone for him for his sin of the Nefesh", it says "he will sanctify his head"! (This shows that they are on the same day.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> If so, the verse should end "he will sanctify his head"!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">18b----------------------------------------18b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it add "on that day"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Without this, we would say that he starts Nezirus Taharah on day eight. This teaches that he starts on day seven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Rebbi expound "on that day"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that he starts on day eight even before bringing his Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What forced Rav Chisda to explain that the Mishnah is like R. Yosi? He could explain like Rebbi, in a case when the Nazir became Tamei on the night of the eighth!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He did not say so, because he holds that the previous night is not Mechusar Zman (rather, it is as if the time for the Korban has arrived, and he would have to bring a Korban for each Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Rejection of suggestion - Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> The beginning of Nezirus Taharah and the obligation for another Korban depend on each other. (Therefore, in any case the Mishnah cannot be like Rebbi.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the previous night is Mechusar Zman , Nezirus Taharah does not start until morning, (and it is like one long Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the previous night is not  Mechusar Zman, Nezirus Taharah starts on the night before the eighth (and he must bring a Korban for each Tum'ah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi (Eliezer  - the Gra deletes this):</span> If he became Tamei on day seven, and again on day seven - he only brings one Korban;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>If he became Tamei on day eight, and again on day eight, he brings a Korban for each Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>He begins Nezirus Taharah immediately;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Chachamim say, he brings one Korban for all the Tum'os, unless he already brought the Chatas;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he brought the Chatas and became Tamei, brought the Chatas (for the latest Tum'ah) and became Tamei, he brings (the remaining) Korbanos for each Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he brought the Chatas, and did not bring the Asham, he begins Nezirus Taharah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>R. Yishmael, the son of R. Yochanan ben Berokah, says, just like he does not begin (Nezirus Taharah) until bringing the Chatas, he does not begin until bringing the Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand Rebbi (Eliezer). It says "He will sanctify his head on that day", even before bringing his Korbanos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim expound, "on that day" - even though he has not brought his Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>How does R. Yishmael expound "on that day"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He begins, even though he has not brought his Olah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim do not need a verse to teach this. The Olah is a mere gift to Hash-m. It is not needed for atonement.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Question:</span> What do we learn from "V'Hezir (he will conduct Nezirus Taharah)... and he will bring... an Asham"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We find that all (other) Ashamos in the Torah are essential to atonement. One would have thought that also Asham Nazir is Me'akev! "V'Hezir... and he will bring" teaches that even before he brings, he is a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span>R. Yishmael expounds "V'Hezir... and he will bring" - he is a Nazir after he brings.</p>
