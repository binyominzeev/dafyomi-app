<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Acha bar Yakov):</span> There is one more firmament above the heads of the Chayos (Yechezkel 1:22).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>However, we cannot discuss that realm, because it has been taught (in Sefer Ben Sira), "Do not inquire about that which is hidden from you."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan ben Zakai):</span> When Nevuchadnezar the wicked resolved to ascend to heaven and make himself as G-d, (Yeshayah 14:14), a Bas Kol issued forth and said:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Man lives only for seventy or eighty years (Tehilim 90:10),</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>and yet the time that it takes to travel from the earth to the top of the Throne of Glory is far greater, for one must go through the seven firmaments and their width, and then through the height of the different parts of the Chayos, and then through the height of the Throne of Glory, or about 14,336,000 years away. ((14 X 500) + (14 X 500) + ((14 X 500) X 2) + ((14 X 500) X 4) + ((14 X 500) X 8) + ((14 X 500) X 16) + ((14 X 500) X 32) + ((14 X 500) X 64) + ((14 X 500) X 128) + ((14 X 500) X 256) + ((14 X 500) X 512) + ((14 X 500) X 1024))</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya):</span> One may not teach Ma'aseh Merkavah to a single individual, but one may give him the chapter headings.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> One may only give the chapter headings to one who is an Av Beis Din and whose heart is fearful within him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> The secrets of the Torah may be given only to one who possesses five character traits, as listed in the verse (Yeshayah 3:3).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> Divrei Torah may not be taught to a Nochri (Tehilim 147:20).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yosef was learned in Ma'aseh Merkavah, while the elders of Pumbedisa were learned in Ma'aseh Bereishis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They agreed to teach each other their respective knowledge.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosef, after learning Ma'aseh Bereishis from the elders of Pumbedisa, refused to teach them Ma'aseh Merkavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"Honey and milk beneath your tongue" (Shir ha'Shirim 4:11) -- the things (secrets of Torah) which are sweeter than honey shall remain beneath your tongue (and not be divulged).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> "Kevasim Lilvushecha (the wool of lambs is your clothing)"  (Mishlei 27:26) -- do not read "Kevasim" but rather "Kevushim (the hidden things)," meaning that the hidden things about the world shall remain hidden under your garment.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They said, "We already know [Ma'aseh Merkavah] until the paragraph of "Vayomer Elai" (Yechezkel 2:1).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Yosef replied, "If so, you know the main part of the Ma'aseh Merkavah!"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is that so? But did not Rebbi say that Ma'aseh Merkavah is until "Va'eire" (Yechezkel 1:27), and R. Yitzchak said until "ha'Chashmal" (1:4)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Until "Va'eire" (or "ha'Chashmal), one may teach the Ma'aseh Merkavah, and from then on one may only give over the chapter headings.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Until "Va'eire" (or "ha'Chashmal") one may give over the chapter headings, and from then on one may give them over only if the student is wise and understands of his own.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it at all permitted to learn "Chashmal" (part of Ma'aseh Merkavah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A young child was learning "Chashmal" and a flame came out and consumed him!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A young child is different, for his time had not yet come [to delve into Ma'aseh Merkavah].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah in the name of Rav):</span> Blessed be the memory of that man named Chananyah ben Chizkiyah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Chachamim wanted to hide away the Book of Yechezkel, due to verses in it which seem to contradict the Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chananyah ben Chizkiyah spent many hours to resolve those verses, and as a result the Chachamim did not hide away the Book of Yechezkel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A young child was reading the Book of Yechezkel and understanding the description of the "Chashmal."</p></div>

<div class="bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yehudah):</span> "Chayos Esh Memalelos" (Chayos of fire speaking)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> "Sometimes they are Chashos (silent), sometimes they are Memalelos (speaking)"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When Hash-m gives forth His speech, they are silent.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>When Hash-m does not give forth his speech, they speak.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is "Ratzo v'Shov" in the verse, "The Chayos are Ratzo v'Shov like the appearance of the Bezek" (Yechezkel 1:14)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Like the light that flashes forth from the oven.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Like the multicolor light flashes that come from between the goldsmiths' potsherds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "... The stormy wind was coming from the north..." (Yechezkel 1:4) -- what was it doing in the north?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It went to the north to give power to Nevuchadnetzar to conquer the entire world.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This was done so that the nations would not say that Hash-m gave over his children to a lowly, weak nation.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Hash-m said, "Who caused that I should be a servant to the idolators? -It was the sins of Yisrael."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "... There was one Ofan on the land, next to the Chayos..." (Yechezkel 1:15) -- this teaches that there is one Malach standing on the earth whose head reaches the Chayos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> That Malach's name is "Sndlpon," who stands 500 years taller than his colleague.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He stands behind the Merkavah and forms crowns for his Creator.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Even though the Creator's place is unknowable (Yechezkel 3:12), this Malach utters the Name and the crown goes by itself and rests upon His head.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>However, Yechezkel was like a villager who saw the king (and thus makes a big deal about it), while Yeshayah was like one who lives in the capital city who saw the king (and thus does not make a big deal about it).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The king of wild animals is the lion, the king of domesticated animals is the ox, the king of birds is the eagle, and man is above them, and Hash-m is above them all and above the entire world (Shemos 15:1).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One verse says that the four-sided face of the angels contains the faces of a man, lion, ox, and eagle (Yechezkel 1:10), while another verse places a cherub in place of the ox (Yechezkel 10:14)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yechezkel prayed for mercy that the face of the ox be replaced, so that it not prosecute the Jewish people (because of the sin of the Golden Calf), and it was changed to a cherub.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does the word "Keruv" (cherub) mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Like a child (k'Rivya)," as they call a child in Bavel "Rivya."</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One is the face of an adult, one is the face of a baby.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One verse says that the angels have six wings (Yeshayah 6:2), while another verse says that they have four wings (Yechezkel 1:6)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One verse (six wings) is referring to when the Beis ha'Mikdash is standing, and the other verse is referring to when the Beis ha'Mikdash is not standing -- the wings of the Chayos diminished.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chananel in the name of Rav):</span> They lost the two wings with which they say Shirah.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One verse says a thousand thousands of angels serve Him, and a myriad of myriads rise before Him (Daniel 7:10), while another verse says there is no number to His legions (Iyov 25:3)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> One verse refers to when the Beis ha'Mikdash is standing (His legions are infinite), while the other verse refers to when the Beis ha'Mikdash is not standing -- the heavenly legions, as it were, diminished.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> The first verse (a thousand thousands) refers to the number of angels in each legion that serve Him; the second verse (an infinite number) refers to the number of His legions.</p></div>
