<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A CROOKED THING THAT CANNOT BE FIXED (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Both the Mishnah and Beraisa are referring to a married woman and a case of rape.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah is referring to the wife of a Yisrael (where the woman remains permitted to her husband, and a lasting sign of the sin is only if a Mazmer is born of the union).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Beraisa is referring to the wife of a Kohen (who becomes forbidden to her husband even when she is raped).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE ONE WHO HAS NO PEACE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "To the one who leaves and the one who comes, there is no peace" (Zecharyah 8:10) -- this refers to one who leaves Halachic discourse and goes to [learn] Scriptures, who has no more peace (for no Halachic ruling can be derived from the Scriptures alone).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> This refers to one who leaves Talmud in order to learn Mishnah (for no Halachic ruling can be derived from the Mishnah alone).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This refers to one who even leaves the Talmud Yerushalmi to learn Talmud Bavli (which is much more difficult).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE ROOTS OF THE ORAL LAW IN THE WRITTEN TORAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Heter Nedarim -- these laws "float in the air" and have no explicit verse to rely upon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Hilchos Shabbos, Chagigos, Me'ilos -- these are like mountains hanging from a hair, for they have very few verses and many detailed laws.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The laws of Dinim (legal judgments), Avodos, Taharos and Tum'os, and Arayos have what to rely upon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>These are the body (essential part) of the Torah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE SOURCE FOR HETER NEDARIM IN THE TORAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Heter Nedarim does have a verse to rely upon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> Heter Nedarim is learned from the repetition of "Ki Yafli" (Vayikra 27:2 and Bamidbar 6:2).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> Heter Nedarim is learned from "Asher Nishbati b'Api" (Tehilim 95:11).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Heter Nedarim is learned from "Kol Nediv Libo" (Shemos 35:5).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chananyah):</span> Heter Nedarim is learned from "Nishbati v'Akaymah" (Tehilim 119:106).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Had I been there, I would have given a source better than all of theirs.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Lo Yachel Devaro" ("he may not annul his word"; Bamidbar 30:3) -- he may not annul it, but others may annul it for him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> All of the sources, except for Shmuel's, have questions on them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is what people mean when they say, "More effective is a single sharp pepper than a basket full of gourds."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE SOURCE FOR HILCHOS SHABBOS IN THE TORAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah say that Hilchos Shabbos have "very few verses" -- there are many verses commanding us to observe Shabbos!?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is referring to the principle that only a Meleches Machsheves is Asur mid'Oraisa, yet it is not written anywhere explicitly.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>THE SOURCE FOR HILCHOS CHAGIGOS IN THE TORAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah say that Hilchos Chagigos have "very few verses" -- there is an explicit source for Chagigos!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have thought that the verse, "v'Chagosem Oso Chag la'Hashem" (Vayikra 23:41) means that they celebrated a party, and not that they brought Korbanos Chagigah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But there is a Gezeirah Shavah of "Midbar" (from Amos 5:25 to Shemos 5:1) which teaches clearly that they brought a Korban Chagigah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hilchos Chagigos are still "like mountains hanging from a hair," because a Gezeirah Shavah from Nevi'im to the Chumash cannot teach a Halachah d'Oraisa (it is only a Remez).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>THE SOURCE FOR HILCHOS ME'ILOS IN THE TORAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah say that Hilchos Me'ilos have "very few verses" -- there is an explicit source for Me'ilah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Mishnah is referring to a case when the owner remembers that the money is Hekdesh and rescinds his Shelichus, while the Shali'ach goes and uses the money of Hekdesh, inadvertently, to buy something for the owner -- the Shali'ach is Chayav for Me'ilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Ashi):</span> But that case is the same as every other case of Me'ilah,  whereby a person inadvertently</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In a normal case of Me'ilah, the person knows that there is money of Hekdesh (he just erred and took that money instead of taking non-Hekdesh money); while in this case, the Shali'ach had absolutely no idea that there was money of Hekdesh, and yet he is still Chayav -- that is why this Halachah is a "mountain suspended by a hair."</p></div>
