<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A CROOKED THING THAT CANNOT BE FIXED (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Both the Mishnah and Beraisa are referring to a married woman and a case of rape.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah is referring to the wife of a Yisrael (where the woman remains permitted to her husband, and a lasting sign of the sin is only if a Mazmer is born of the union).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Beraisa is referring to the wife of a Kohen (who becomes forbidden to her husband even when she is raped).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE ONE WHO HAS NO PEACE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "To the one who leaves and the one who comes, there is no peace" (Zecharyah 8:10) -- this refers to one who leaves Halachic discourse and goes to [learn] Scriptures, who has no more peace (for no Halachic ruling can be derived from the Scriptures alone).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> This refers to one who leaves Talmud in order to learn Mishnah (for no Halachic ruling can be derived from the Mishnah alone).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This refers to one who even leaves the Talmud Yerushalmi to learn Talmud Bavli (which is much more difficult).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>MISHNAH</i>: THE ROOTS OF THE ORAL LAW IN THE WRITTEN TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Heter Nedarim -- these laws "float in the air" and have no explicit verse to rely upon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Hilchos Shabbos, Chagigos, Me'ilos -- these are like mountains hanging from a hair, for they have very few verses and many detailed laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The laws of Dinim (legal judgments), Avodos, Taharos and Tum'os, and Arayos have what to rely upon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>These are the body (essential part) of the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE SOURCE FOR <i>HETER NEDARIM</i> IN THE TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Heter Nedarim does have a verse to rely upon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> Heter Nedarim is learned from the repetition of "Ki Yafli" (Vayikra 27:2 and Bamidbar 6:2).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> Heter Nedarim is learned from "Asher Nishbati b'Api" (Tehilim 95:11).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Heter Nedarim is learned from "Kol Nediv Libo" (Shemos 35:5).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Chananyah):</span> Heter Nedarim is learned from "Nishbati v'Akaymah" (Tehilim 119:106).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Had I been there, I would have given a source better than all of theirs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Lo Yachel Devaro" ("he may not annul his word"; Bamidbar 30:3) -- he may not annul it, but others may annul it for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> All of the sources, except for Shmuel's, have questions on them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is what people mean when they say, "More effective is a single sharp pepper than a basket full of gourds."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE SOURCE FOR <i>HILCHOS</i> SHABBOS IN THE TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah say that Hilchos Shabbos have "very few verses" -- there are many verses commanding us to observe Shabbos!?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is referring to the principle that only a Meleches Machsheves is Asur mid'Oraisa, yet it is not written anywhere explicitly.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>THE SOURCE FOR <i>HILCHOS CHAGIGOS</i> IN THE TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah say that Hilchos Chagigos have "very few verses" -- there is an explicit source for Chagigos!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have thought that the verse, "v'Chagosem Oso Chag la'Hashem" (Vayikra 23:41) means that they celebrated a party, and not that they brought Korbanos Chagigah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But there is a Gezeirah Shavah of "Midbar" (from Amos 5:25 to Shemos 5:1) which teaches clearly that they brought a Korban Chagigah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hilchos Chagigos are still "like mountains hanging from a hair," because a Gezeirah Shavah from Nevi'im to the Chumash cannot teach a Halachah d'Oraisa (it is only a Remez).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">7)</span>THE SOURCE FOR <i>HILCHOS ME'ILOS</i> IN THE TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah say that Hilchos Me'ilos have "very few verses" -- there is an explicit source for Me'ilah!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Mishnah is referring to a case when the owner remembers that the money is Hekdesh and rescinds his Shelichus, while the Shali'ach goes and uses the money of Hekdesh, inadvertently, to buy something for the owner -- the Shali'ach is Chayav for Me'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Ashi):</span> But that case is the same as every other case of Me'ilah,  whereby a person inadvertently</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In a normal case of Me'ilah, the person knows that there is money of Hekdesh (he just erred and took that money instead of taking non-Hekdesh money); while in this case, the Shali'ach had absolutely no idea that there was money of Hekdesh, and yet he is still Chayav -- that is why this Halachah is a "mountain suspended by a hair."</p>
