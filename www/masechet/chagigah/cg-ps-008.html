<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>FROM WHAT TYPE OF PROPERTY MAY ONE BRING <i>KORBANOS</i>? (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel argue whether the Chagigah of the first day of Pesach must be brought from Chulin (Beis Shamai) or may even be brought from Ma'aser (Beis Hillel).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are they discussing specifically the Chagigah of the first day of Pesach, if the same applies to the Chagigos of all festivals?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They mention the Chagigah of the Fifteenth of Nisan to teach that the Chagigah of that day is mid'Oraisa, to exclude the Chagigah of the Fourteenth of Nisan, which is only mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Beis Hillel say that the Chagigah of the first day of Pesach may be brought from Ma'aser -- it is an obligatory Korban, and all obligatory Korbanos must be brought from Chulin!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beis Hillel is referring to a case of "Tofel" -- adding Ma'aser to one's Chulin in order to have more meat (Beis Hillel permits "Tofel," while Beis Shamai maintains that the entire Korban must come from Chulin).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> One may combine an <i>animal</i> of Ma'aser with an <i>animal</i> of Chulin (to serve as the Korban Chagigah so that a large family has more meat to eat), but not money of Ma'aser with money of Chulin (to bring one large animal).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One may combine <i>money</i> of Ma'aser with <i>money</i> of Chulin (to bring one large animal), but not an animal of Ma'aser with an animal of Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>There are Beraisos which support both opinions.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WITH WHAT TYPE OF KORBAN MAY ONE FULFILL THE OBLIGATION OF SIMCHAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>"You shall rejoice in your festival" (Devarim 16:14) teaches that one fulfills the Mitzvah of Simchah with all types of Simchah-inducing meats.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This includes the meat of Korbanos Nedarim, Nedavos, and Ma'aser Behemah for a Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>For a Kohen, this also includes the meat of a Chatas, Asham, Bechor, and the Chazeh and Shok.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this also includes birds and flour offerings!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse emphasizes, "You shall rejoice in your festival (b'Chagecha)," meaning that your Simchah shall come from whatever animal the Chagigah comes from, which excludes birds and flour.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ashi):</span> The verse says, "You shall rejoice" -- the flesh of birds and flour do not bring a person to rejoice (while the meat of animals does).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Ashi do with the phrase, "[You shall rejoice] <i>in your festival</i>?"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that during the festival, one may not marry, because the verse says that one must rejoice "in your festival" and not in your wife.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE AMOUNT OF ANIMALS ONE BRINGS DEPENDS ON HIS PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One who has many people to feed (in his family), but little property, should bring many Shelamim and few Olos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One who has few people to feed, but lots of property, should bring many Olos and few Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One who has few people to feed and little property, for such a person the minimum values of one Me'ah's worth (of Olos) and two Me'ah's worth (of Shelamim) apply.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>One who has many people to feed and lots of property, for such a person the verse, "every man according to what he can give, according to the blessing that Hash-m gave you" (Devarim 16:17) applies.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>BRINGING LOTS OF ANIMALS AS KORBANOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can one who has many people to feed, but has little property, bring many Shelamim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is "Tofel" -- he combines Ma'aser with his Chulin to bring more animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> He combines Ma'aser money with Chulin money to bring one big animal (like R. Yochanan on 8a).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Sheshes):</span> He may <i>even</i> combine Ma'aser animals with Chulin animals to bring many animals (a third opinion, not like Chizkiyah nor R. Yochanan on 8a).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>WHAT TO DO IF ONE DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO BRING ALL OF HIS KORBANOS ON THE FIRST DAY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> One who separated ten animals as his Korban Chagigah, and only had time to bring five on the first day of Yom Tov, may bring the remaining five on the second day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Since the day ended, he may no longer bring the remaining animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> Reish Lakish and R. Yochanan are not arguing.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Reish Lakish is referring to when the person specified that he separated all ten animals to be brought on the first day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yochanan is referring to when the person did not specify that the animals were all meant to be brought on the first day.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Furthermore, there was time left to bring them on the first day.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>And he had family members to eat them as well.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>The fact that he did not bring them shows that he intended all along to bring them on the second day (and thus there is a problem of Bal Tosif).</p></div>
