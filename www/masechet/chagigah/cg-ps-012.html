<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE HEIGHT OF MAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Now that the verse says that one may ask only about what is within the world (and not about what was before its creation), for what do we need the verse, "from the day that Hash-m created man on the earth?"</p></div>
