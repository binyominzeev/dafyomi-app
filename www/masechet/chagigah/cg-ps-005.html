<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>VERSES THAT MADE THE <i>AMORA'IM</i> CRY (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Yochanan cried at the verse, "You persuaded Me to destroy him for no reason" (Iyov 2:3) -- what hope does a servant have whose Master can be persuaded to destroy him!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yochanan cried at the verse, "He cannot have faith even in His holy ones" (Iyov 15:15) -- if in His holy ones He cannot have faith, then in whom can He have faith!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yochanan cried at the verse, "I will draw near to you in judgment, and I will be a swift witness against sorcerers, adulterers, those who swear falsely, and those who extort the wage of a worker" (Malachi 3:5) -- a servant whose master is quick to judge him, does he have any hope!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yochanan cried at the verse, "For every deed G-d judges, even everything hidden, whether good or bad" (Koheles 12:14) -- a servant whose master equates inadvertent sins with advertent ones, does he have any hope!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>What does "everything hidden" mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> It refers to one who kills a bug in front of his friend and his friend is disgusted by it.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> "Everything hidden" refers to one who spits in front of his friend and his friend is disgusted by it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>What does "whether good or bad" mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> It refers to one who gives Tzedakah to a poor person in public, because doing so embarrasses him.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shila):</span> It  refers to one who gives Tzedakah to a woman in private, because doing so brings her to be suspected.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It refers to one who gives meat that is not yet cut on Erev Shabbos (since, because of her rush, she will not properly remove the forbidden sinews).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It refers to one who gives money to a poor person when he is pressed (and does not have a chance to buy food when it is cheap, but must spent the money for food right away).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yochanan cried at the verse, "Evils that are many and troubles" (Devarim 31:21) -- a servant whose master brings upon him evils and troubles, does he have any hope!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>These evils will be troubles to each other, like a bee sting and scorpion sting in one place.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "My anger will rage against him on that day, I will abandon them, and I will hide My face from them" (Devarim 31:17) -- all from whom Hash-m's face is not hidden are not "from them," from the Jewish people.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "I will certainly hide My face on that day" (Devarim 31:18) -- even though He hides His face from them during the day, but He speaks to them in dreams at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosef):</span> His hand is stretched over us to protect us (Yeshayah 51:16).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Yehoshua ben Chananyah protected the people from the accusations of heretics.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>When R. Yehoshua ben Chananyah was dying, the Rabanan asked him who will now protect them from heretics.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>He answered that when the Jewish people become weaker, so too do the nations (Yirmiyahu 49:7, Bereishis 33:12).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ila):</span> A servant whose master relates to him all of his speech (Amos 4:13), does he have any hope!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This includes even the speech between a man and his wife (at times of conjugal relations), which is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Such speech, however, is permitted when necessary to appease her.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HASH-M CRIES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "My soul will cry in hidden chambers because of the pride" (Yirmiyah 13:17) -- Hash-m has a place called "Mistarim" (where He cries).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "Because of the pride" of Israel that was taken from them and given to the idolators.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmeni):</span> "Because of the pride" that was taken from the Heavenly Kingship.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Hash-m experience sadness? But the verse says that "joy is in His place" (Divrei ha'Yamim I 16:27)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> On the outside, there is only joy, but in the inner chamber, there is sadness as well.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>When the Beis ha'Mikdash was destroyed, there was sadness even in His outer chambers (Yeshayah 33:7).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Hash-m cried three tears (Yirmiyahu 13:17):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One for the first Beis ha'Mikdash, one for the second Beis ha'Mikdash, and one for the exile of the Jewish people.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Others say that the third tear was for Bitul Torah, because there is no greater Bitul Torah than that of the Galus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Hash-m cries each day for the person who is able to learn Torah but does not, for the person who is unable but does anyway, and for the leader who becomes haughty over the community.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> The honor of the Jewish people has fallen from great heights to great depths.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Rebbi convinced R. Chiya to take him to visit the blind Rav of their host town, who blessed them for coming to see him even though he cannot see them, with the blessing that they should merit to greet the One who sees but cannot be seen.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rebbi had learned the importance of visiting a Talmid Chacham from R. Yakov, who, even into his old age, visited his Rav every day, as he learned from a verse in Tehilim (49:10).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Idi, the father of R. Yakov, used to travel three months in order to spend one day learning in the Yeshivah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One who learns Torah for even a single day in the year is as if he learned Torah the entire year, as derived from a verse (Yeshayah 58:2).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Likewise, one who does an Aveirah even one day in the year is as if he transgressed for the entire year, as derived from a verse (Bamidbar 14:34).</p></div>
