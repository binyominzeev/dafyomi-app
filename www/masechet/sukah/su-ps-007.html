<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE TEFACH OF THE THIRD WALL WHEN TWO WALLS ARE PERPENDICULAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where (according to the Rabanan) would we place the Tefach constituting the third wall?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> The Tefach is placed at a right angle, at either end of the "L" created by the first two walls.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Kahana and R. Asi):</span> It should be placed at an angle (45 degrees) into the "L" (giving the appearance of closing the Sukah)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav was silent (indicating his non-acceptance - Ritva).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Levi was cited (by Shmuel) as ruling like Rav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Simon, or, R. Yehoshua b. Levi):</span> The Tefach is a generous Tefach and it is placed just under three Tefachim from the end of the L (making a Lavud wall of four Tefachim, the majority of a seven-Tefach wall).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE THIRD WALL WHEN TWO WALLS ARE PARALLEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> The Sukah is Kosher if made from two parallel walls (like a Mavoy Mefulash) with the additional Tefach placed at any end.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Simon, or, R. Yehoshua b. Levi):</span> Such a Sukah requires a board slightly larger than four Tefachim, placed within three Tefachim of the end of one of the parallel walls.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why, when the walls were perpendicular, a generous Tefach was sufficient, and now you require four Tefachim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The perpendicular walls create two proper walls (and the small addition is sufficient), whereas parallel walls are not Kosher, and Rov Dofen is needed to be Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>RAVA'S QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE TEFACH ADDED TO TWO KOSHER WALLS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava-First Rendition):</span> The additional Tefach must be placed in the form of a Tzuras ha'Pesach (a half-Tefach board on each end of a seven-Tefach-wide Tzuras ha'Pesach, connected above -Rashi D"H Amar Rava).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava-Second Rendition):</span> A substitute for the additional Tefach could be a seven-Tefach-wide Tzuras ha'Pesach, even without a total of a Tefach-width.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava-Third Rendition):</span> In addition to the Tefach, we require a seven-Tefach-wide Tzuras ha'Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Kehana made a Sukah using a generous Tefach within three Tefachim, in addition to a Tzuras ha'Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Ashi):</span> But Rava said that either a Tefach or a Tzuras ha'Pesach will suffice!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Kehana):</span> I hold like the third rendition of Rava.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SUKAH AND SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah or Rava):</span> Since (Migo) we see the additional Tefach as constituting a wall for Sukah, it would also be considered a wall for the purposes of carrying on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> But the Beraisa teaches that the Halachos of Shabbos during Sukos are <i>more Chamur</i> than the Halachos of Sukah the rest of the week!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa says that walls are created for Sukah the same way that they are created for Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Lavud wall (made of ropes with less than a three- Tefach space in between) is thus Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Shabbos has the Chumrah that we require that the Omed exceed the Parutz, which we do not require for Sukah (since we allow the absence of all of the fourth and most of the third walls).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>We see that we not <i>not</i> call any Kosher Sukah as enclosed for the purposes of the Shabbos of Sukos!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa means that Shabbasos <i>other</i> than the Shabbos of Sukos have this Chumrah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then the Beraisa should have listed a Chumrah of the general Hilchos Sukah over the Sukah of Shabbos in that a Sukah requires a generous Tefach as a third wall whereas you (if Abaye is speaking with Rava, but Mar, if it is Abaye speaking to his Rebbi, Rabah) only require a Lechi, and not a Tefach, at the opening of the Mavoy Mefulash!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is unnecessary to point that out since we already apply the Migo to permit a Sukah wall on Shabbos, it goes without saying that we permit a Sukah owing to its validity on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>PUTTING SECHACH ON A LECHI-OUTFITTED MAVOY MEFULASH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Rabah (or Rava):</span> also taught that we could put Sechach on the four posts around a public well (Pasei Bira'os).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Each of these Halachos are needed:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had we been taught only the Hechsher of a Lechi-equipped Mavoy we might have attributed the Heter to the presence of two proper (though parallel) walls, but not applied the Heter where there are no actual walls.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had we been taught only Pasei Bira'os we might have attributed the Heter to the existence of <i>four</i> walls (albeit only Halachic ones) and not applied the Heter where we do not call it a four-walled enclosure.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Had we been taught both of these, but not the blanket rule above that anything which constitutes a wall for Sukah is deemed a wall for Shabbos, we might only have applied the Heter from Shabbos (which is more Chamur) to Sukah, and not the reverse.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>A SUKAH WHOSE LIGHT IS MORE THAN ITS SHADE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Beraisa (Rabanan):</span> If the light that comes in through the walls (such as through gaps or windows) is more than the shade, the Sukah is Kosher; the Sukah is Pasul only when the light coming through the Sechach is more than the shade.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>(R. Yoshiyah) Even light coming through the sides will invalidate the Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yoshiyah's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is written, "You shall cover (v'Sachosa) the Aron with the Paroches."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Paroches is a partition and yet the Torah calls it "Sechach."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Therefore, the partition must be like the Sechach (and not let more light than shade into the Sukah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do the Rabanan respond?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah calls the Paroches "Sechach" because its edges extended slightly over the side of the Aron and had the appearance of Sechach.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>THE TANA'IM WHO HOLD THAT A SUKAH IS A DIRAS KEVA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Rebbi, R. Yoshiyah, R. Yehudah, R. Shimon, R. Gamliel, Beis Shamai, R. Eliezer, and Acherim all hold that a Sukah must be a Diras Keva.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rebbi says (Beraisa) that any Sukah which is not 4x4 Amos is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yoshiyah, as we learned above (in the Beraisa, 1.a.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehudah says (Mishnah) that a Sukah taller than 20 Amos is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Shimon says (Beraisa) that three of the Sukah's walls must be of proper size, but the fourth may be even one Tefach wide.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Gamliel says (Beraisa) that a Sukah made atop a wagon or a boat is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Beis Shamai says (Beraisa) that one whose head and most of his body were in the Sukah but his table was in the house did not fulfill the Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>R. Eliezer says (Mishnah) that a Sukah made like a tent (the roof of which also serves as the walls) or a Sukah made by leaning the branches of the Sechach against a wall (forming a shelter underneath) is Pasul, because it has no actual roof.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>Acherim say (Beraisa) that a Sukah made like a bird coop (i.e. round) is Pasul, because it does not have corners.</p></div>
