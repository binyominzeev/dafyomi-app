<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A STOLEN SUKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> A stolen Sukah and one made in Reshus ha'Rabim are Pesulim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> They are Kesheirim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman):</span> Their dispute (in a case where Reuven forced Shimon out of his Sukah) is over whether a person may be Yotzei with another person's Sukah (Chachamim) or not (R. Eliezer).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The position of R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If land can be stolen, then this is a stolen Sukah (which R. Eliezer on 27b has taught is not Kesheirah).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If land cannot be stolen then this is as borrowed, and, again, is Pesulah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The position of Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Land cannot be stolen, so this Sukah is still the property of its original owner.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>One may be Yotzei with a borrowed Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If wood was stolen and used for Sechach, the thief must pay for the wood (we do not obligate the thief to return the wood itself and the Sukah is Kesheirah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for permitting the Sukah with stolen Sechach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because the Mishnah listed the stolen Sukah together with one built in Reshus ha'Rabim, to prohibit a Sukah which is not on his property (but stolen wood, where the property is his, does not impede his being Yotzei).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>In the reported incident, R. Nachman insisted (over her intense cries) that the woman was entitled only to the cost of the stolen Sechach, and not to the Sechach itself (and the Sukah is Kesheirah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TAKANAS HA'SHAVIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>(Ravina) The protection given to a thief in order to encourage him to repent is extended to the beam of a Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely allowing him to leave the beam in place is not more newsworthy than the Sechach which R. Nachman just permitted!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might not have made the extension from Sechach (which is readily available) to a beam (which is hard to find, and we might have obligated the thief to dismantle his Sukah to return it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>After Sukos, the thief must return the beam, since this temporary structure does not engender great expense in being dismantled.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If, however, he cemented the beam into the ground then, again, he is obligated in its value, not in the beam.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HADAR BY THE LULAV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> A dried out Lulav is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> It is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> While they argue whether a Lulav needs Hadar as does an Esrog, they agree that an Esrog must be Hadar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we see in the Mishnah, where R. Yehudah requires that he tie the loose ends of the Lulav leaves together that he <i>does</i> demand Hadar for an Esrog!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The reason for that requirement is to create a singular leaf, as alluded to in the Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find that R. Yehudah requires that the Minim be bound together with its own species, surely for the sake of Hadar!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Its own species is not required (as taught by Rava) but R. Yehudah's requirement stems from the obligation to bind the Lulav, thus making the binding a potential fifth species.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>HADAR BY THE ESROG</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see that R. Yehudah does not require the Esrog to be Hadar!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>While he does not allow fewer nor more species other than the four specified, and no other substitute fruits in the event that no Esrog is available;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Somewhat dried (Kemushin) Minim are Kosher, but dried out ones are not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehudah allows one which is dried out (not Hadar) in that case, and cites an incident to support his ruling (where fathers passed their Lulavim on to their sons).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">31b----------------------------------------31b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>His proof is rejected since we cannot bring a proof from times of need.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But he said that a dried Esrog is Kosher!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was referring to a dried Lulav (as indicated by the cited incident which spoke of a Lulav).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely it is obvious that one may not add to the Minim (Bal Tosif)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have permitted another Min which was not bound together with the other three, given that the binding is obligatory, this other Min might be viewed as entirely separate.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it not obvious that he may not substitute other fruits for the Esrog!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have permitted its inclusion so that the concept of Esrog would not be forgotten (but we forbid this due to our concern that the proper law might then become forgotten).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (on Rava who asserts that R. Yehudah requires an Esrog to be Hadar):</span> But we see in the Beraisa that R. Yehudah permits an old Esrog!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This indeed refutes Rava.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we see that R. Yehudah forbids an intensely green Esrog, surely because it is not Hadar!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is unfinished in its unripe state, and hence not fit for use (not due to Hadar).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we see that R. Yehudah requires that it be KeBEtzah in size, surely for Hadar!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is, again, invalid owing to its unfinished state.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we see that R. Yehudah restricts the size of a large Esrog (to half the size of a person's capacity to hold), surely because the smaller one is more Hadar!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The large one is invalid because of the logistics involved in handling the Lulav and Esrog (and safely switching hands with them) not due to Hadar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then why, according to R. Yehudah, does the Pasuk use the word Hadar when speaking of the Esrog!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to a fruit which resides (haDar) on the tree from year to year (an ability of an Esrog).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>LULAV FROM AN ASHEIRAH IS PASUL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rava allows (b'Di'eved) a Lulav from Avodah Zara!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is speaking of a tree which must be burned, which reduces its size, Halachically, to zero (as indicated by the juxtaposition of Asheirah in the Mishnah to the case of the Ir ha'Nidachas, which we know must be destroyed).</p></div>
