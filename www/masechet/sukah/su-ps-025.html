<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A SWAYING <i>MECHITZAH</i> (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We find that standing sheaves surrounding a person create a Mechitzah, and surely they sway in the wind!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here, too, we are speaking where the sheaves have been tied up so that they cannot sway.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MISHNAH: EXEMPTIONS FROM SUKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Those en route to perform a Mitzvah are exempt from Sukah, as are those who are ill and their attendants.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One is permitted to snack outside of the Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>OSEK B'MITZVAH PATUR MIN HA'MITZVAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for the Din of Osek b'Mitzvah Patur Min ha'Mitzvah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa learns from BeShivtecha BiVeisecha that one who is doing a Mitzvah is Patur from Shema.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa lists others who are exempt from Shema.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Also included are a groom on the day of his marriage to a Besulah (but not to an Almanah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does this Pasuk infer an exemption to the Osek B'Mitzvah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Huna):</span> The word Derech implies that the obligation is only upon one who is traveling for his personal needs, not for a Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But surely Derech can also refer to (and obligate) one who is travelling for Mitzvah needs!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The suffix of Uv'Lechtecha implies personal travel, not Mitzvah travel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then one who marries an Almanah (a Mitzvah) should also be exempt!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is not preoccupied as is one who marries a Besulah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If every preoccupation creates an exemption, then one who is in sorrow over his financial loss should be similarly exempt!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps this is true.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we know that a mourner is obligated in all Mitzvos except Tefilin (based on the Pasuk in Yechezkel which refers to Pe'er)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A groom is exempt due to his preoccupation with a Mitzvah.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the source for the exemption of Osek B'Mitzvah is learned from the exemption from Korban Pesach given to those who were involved in the Mitzvah of burying Nadav and Avihu!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa asks who were those who were Tameh and unable to bring the Korban Pesach such that they were given Pesach Sheni?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi ha'Gelili):</span> The pallbearers of Yosef ha'Tzadik.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Akiva):</span> Mishael and Eltzafan, who buried Nadav and Avihu.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yitzchak):</span> These should have been able to use the Parah Adumah and become Tahor in time to bring the Korban!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, they were dealing with a Mes Mitzvah, and the seventh day of the Taharah occurred on Erev Pesach, such that they were unable to participate in the Korban that day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We need both sources (Pesach and Krias Shema).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>From Pesach alone we might have exempted only one who became preoccupied prior to the arrival of his obligation (as they became Tameh before the Pesach could have been brought).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>From Krias Shema alone we might only exempt one from an obligation which does not carry a Kares.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>AN AVEL AND TEFILIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the Pasuk in Yechezkel exempt a mourner from Tefilin?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba b. Zavda citing Rav):</span> The Pasuk obligates Yechezkel in his mourning to be unlike all other mourners and to wear his Tefilin, implying the exemption to all other mourners.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This exemption only applies on the first day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is derived from "Yom Mar" implying the first bitter day.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>AN AVEL AND SUKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba b. Zavda citing Rav):</span> An Avel is obligated to dwell in the Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this not obvious?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have exempted him as a Mitztaer (he suffers from the obligation not to sit dark and alone in his mourning).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The exemption of Mitztaer only applies to discomfort caused by the Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Here his discomfort is from within himself, and he must set his mind right to do the Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>A CHASAN AND SUKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba b. Zavda citing Rav):</span> A Chasan and the wedding party are exempt from Sukah for seven days.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should this be so?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because they are engaged in the Mitzvah of rejoicing with the Chasan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then let them eat and rejoice in the Sukah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The joy is centered on the Chupah, and is not to be taken away from there.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then let them eat in the Sukah and rejoice at the Chupah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The rejoicing surrounds the Seudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Let them make the Chupah in the Sukah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> We are concerned lest someone violate the prohibition of Yichud.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We are concerned for the embarrassment of the Chasan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference will derive from their dispute?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A case where many people are around, thus obviating the problem of Yichud, but leaving the embarrassment of the Chasan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Zeira reported that he ate and rejoiced in the Sukah (all the more so because of the double Mitzvah).</p></div>
