<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE SUKAH ON THE EIGHTH DAY OUTSIDE OF <i>ERETZ</i> <i>YISRAEL</i> (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosef):</span> Bear R. Yochanan in mind given the incident in which the great Rabbis ate in the Sukah on Shemini Atzeres but did not recite a Berachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But maybe they held that one does not recite a Berachah on any day past the first!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We have a tradition that they had not yet fulfilled the Mitzvah of Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Alternate rendition of the above discussion:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue over residing in the Sukah (only residing there if it is viewed as the seventh day and not the eighth in all regards) while all agree that one does not recite a Berachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosef):</span> Bear R. Yochanan in mind (don't sit in the Sukah at all) since the one who cited Rav's position (R. Yehudah bar R. Shmuel b. Shilas) himself ate outside the Sukah on the eighth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Halachah is to eat in the Sukah but not to recite the Berachah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SHE'HECHEYANU ON THE EIGHTH DAY OF SUKOS VERSUS THE LAST DAY OF PESACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One recites Shehechiyanu on Shemini Atzeres, but not on the last day of Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Levi b. Chama):</span> This is evidenced by the fact that three items of Sukos (Sukah, Lulav and Nisuch ha'Mayim) or, according to R. Yehudah, two items, do not appear on Shemini Atzeres.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then the absence of Matzah on the seventh day should generate a Shehechiyanu there!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (first):</span> Only the night differs by Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> Shemini Atzeres differs from the day preceding, unlike Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Papa):</span> Shemini Atzeres is distinguished in the Torah because of one Par (versus Parim).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Nachman b. Yitzchak):</span> The word BaYom singles out Shemini Atzeres (versus Uv'Yom).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ashi):</span> KaMishpat (versus k'Mishpatam).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shall we see R. Yehudah (in the following Beraisa) as a support for R. Yochanan?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> The designated number of all Korbanos of Sukos are Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> The Parim, whose numbers descend, are not Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But they all (including the Eilim and Kevasim) descend into Shemini Atzeres!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah):</span> Shemini Atzeres is a separate Regel given that it has its unique Korban, Shir, Berachah and Linah compared to the days of Sukos.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">47b----------------------------------------47b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Presumably, its Berachah refers to Shehechiyanu!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, that refers to the unique reference to the day in Tefilah, not to Shehechiyanu.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is further unlikely that R. Yehudah was referring to Shehechiyanu since there is no Shehechiyanu on the seven days of Sukos as implied by R. Yehudah's comparison.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>That may still refer to Shehechiyanu and he is speaking of reciting the Berachah all seven days if it were not said previously.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But there could not be such an obligation given that people do not ordinarily have the required cup of wine to recite Shehechiyanu!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps he does not need a cup of wine, and this supports R. Nachman in his assertion!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>No, it could be that there is no obligation unless he happens upon a cup of wine.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>LINAH ON SHEMINI ATZERES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could R. Yehudah have required Linah on Shemini Atzeres given his teaching regarding the exclusions of Linah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> Pesach Sheni does not require Linah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is excluded by the proximity of the obligation of Linah to the words Sheshes Yamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This teaches that the days which have a six day follow-up (as in Pesach where Matzah is eaten for the subsequent six days) have Linah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This would appear to exclude Shemini Atzeres!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it excludes Pesach Sheni, which is other- wise similar to Pesach Rishon where these Pesukim appear.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This is supported by the Mishnah which teaches that Bikurim require Korban, Shir, Tenufah and Linah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who said that it is R. Yehudah who teaches that Bikurim require Tenufah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn it from the Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Yehudah says that v'Hinicho refers to Tenufah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>It cannot mean actual Hanachah since the Pasuk already said v'Hinachto.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the Mishnah is R. Eliezer b. Yakov (who also holds that Bikurim require Tenufah) and we cannot establish that R. Yehudah is the author of the above Mishnah and requires Linah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Eliezer b. Yakov learns that Bikurim require Tenufah from v'Lakach ha'Kohen</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>His source is Yad-Yad.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>The resulting procedure is described.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Halachah regarding Shehechiyanu on Shemini Atzeres?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Nachman):</span> We recite Shehechiyanu.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Sheshes):</span> We do not recite Zeman.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>l'Halachah, we recite it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>A Beraisa supports R. Nachman, which calls Shemini Atzeres a separate Regel in regards the six areas of <b>PZ</b>"R <b>KS</b>"B (Payis, Zeman, Regel [Sukah], Korban, Shira and Berachah).</p></div>
