<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ERETZ YISRAEL FOLLOWING CHUTZ LA'ARETZ (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we see from Lulav that those in Eretz Yisrael are not restricted by the limitations of those outside!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Lulav does not override in Eretz Yisrael, either.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But then the Beraisos are still contradictory!?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One states that they brought their Lulavim to the Beis ha'Mikdash and one says that they brought them to the Beis ha'Kneses.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>We had resolved this by stating that one was at the time of the Mikdash and one after.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>But we are now asserting that even in Eretz Yisrael the Lulav does not override Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One Beraisa speaks in the Mikdash and one speaks outside of the Mikdash (but Lulav is not Docheh anywhere after the Churban).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Why do we single out Lulav for a seven-day Zecher l'Mikdash but we only make a one-day Zecher l'Mikdash for the Mitzvah of Aravah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> There is a Zecher to the Aravah in the daily use of the Lulav (with its Aravos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> That Aravah does not represent its Mitzvah, since it is only part of Lulav!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He must pick the Lulav up a second time.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We have never seen such a thing!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zevid citing Rava):</span> Lulav is d'Oraisa (and hence gets a seven-day Zecher) whereas Aravah is d'Rabanan (and gets only one day).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to whom is Aravah d'Rabanan!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> According to Aba Shaul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But he learns it from the plural Arvei!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is according to Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But they hold that Aravah is a Halachah l'Moshe mi'Sinai (as taught by R. Asi citing R. Yochanan citing R. Nechunya) not d'Rabanan!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zevid citing Rava):</span> Lulav has its basis in the Torah outside of the Mikdash (and thus gets a seven day Zecher) whereas the Mitzvah of Aravah outside of the Mikdash has no basis in the Torah (it is Halachah l'Moshe mi'Sinai only in the Mikdash).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE CHIYUV FOR ALL KOHANIM TO DO HAKAFAH WITH ARAVOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Resh Lakish):</span> Even the Ba'alei Mumin would press in to fulfil the Mitzvah of surrounding the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Who said this Halachah (presumably asking who said that there is an obligation for each Kohen to do Hakafah)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could R. Yochanan have asked this, seeing that he, himself, taught this Halachah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he was asking who taught that the Mitzvah is with Netilah and not just setting Aravos up along the Mizbe'ach (something which could be done by just one Kohen)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He further questioned as to who said that Ba'alei Mumin are also obligated?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yochanan and R. Yehoshua b. Levi argued over whether the Aravah is a Yesod Nevi'im or a Minhag Nevi'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>We may conclude that R. Yochanan is of the opinion that it is Yesod Nevi'im since R. Avahu cited his opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira to R. Avahu):</span> But it was R. Yochanan who taught that Aravah is Halachah l'Moshe mi'Sinai!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu, after a moment of stunned silence):</span> R. Yochanan referred to the fact that in Bavel the Halachos mi'Sinai were forgotten and were restored (Yesod) by the Nevi'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Yochanan taught that the Torah in its entirety is to be found among the scholars of Bavel!?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">44b----------------------------------------44b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the Mikdash it was Halachah l'Moshe mi'Sinai whereas outside it was the Yesod Nevi'im.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE ARAVAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> The Aravah must have a Shiur, must be taken alone and one may not use the Aravah which is bound with his Lulav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it must be taken alone then it goes without saying that one may not use the Aravah bound with his Lulav!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have permitted this Aravah if he picked up his Lulav-set a second time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> One may use the Aravah bound with his Lulav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Shiur of Aravah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Nachman):</span> Three branches with moist leaves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Sheshes):</span> Even one leaf and one branch.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is one leaf or one leafless branch?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, one leaf on one branch.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>INCIDENTS OF R. ELAZAR B'REBBI TZADOK, AS REPORTED BY EIVO</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Elazar was brought an Aravah and he was Chovet (waved it-Rashi) and did not recite a Berachah, holding that it is Minhag Nevi'im (the same was done by Rav, for the same reason).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Elazar was very impressed with the wealthy man who asked regarding the manner in which he was paying his workers with Shevi'is produce.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The man returned to ask how to properly pay.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Elazar told him to use money.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But this labor (Kishkush) is not permitted on Shemitah (as in the Beraisa)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ukva b. Chama):</span> One Kishkush is permitted (covering the roots, for the survival of the tree) and one is not permitted (for the enhancement of the tree).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Eivo cited R. Elazar as teaching that a person must not travel more than three Parsah on Erev Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Kehana):</span> This restricts him only when traveling to his home, not to an inn (since he is not relying on the innkeeper to have food for him, he is not likely to be angered by its absence).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Alternate R. Kehana):</span> This restricts him <i>even</i> if going to his home (where he may well find at least something to eat).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>(R. Kehana) I once came home too close to Shabbos and there was absolutely nothing for me to eat.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE MITZVAH OF LULAV IN THE MIKDASH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>An Amora recited in our Mishnah that they would place the Lulavim on the <i>Gag</i> of the Itztaba, instead on the <i>Gav</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Nachman):</span> Why would they put them out on the roof (to dry)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, remember the Mishnah as Al Gav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rachva citing R. Yehudah):</span> Har ha'Bayis was designed with rows of such posts (Itztabaos).</p></div>
