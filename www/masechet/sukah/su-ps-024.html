<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>VIEWING DEATH AS (IM)PROBABLE (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that creates a contradiction between R. Meir's position regarding the animal (suspecting that it will die) and his position regarding the barrel (where he does not suspect that it may break)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Death is more likely (and out of one's control) than breakage.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we have created a contradiction in the positions of R. Yehudah who permits using the animal but forbids relying on the barrel!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah forbids the case of the barrel because he does not hold of Bereirah, not because of concern for the barrel's breaking.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we have an indication from the Seifa of the barrel Beraisa that R. Yehudah <i>is</i> concerned about the breaking of the barrel!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They (including R. Yehudah) challenged R. Meir by asking if he is not concerned about the barrel breaking (leaving the person having drunk Tevel)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir responded with lack of concern.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Clearly, then, R. Yehudah <i>is</i> concerned about its breakage!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah was asking R. Meir only according to R. Meir's position, holding of Bereirah (R. Yehudah himself would not be bothered by the question since the option of designating future barrels does not exist).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find R. Yehudah concerned about death (as R. Yehudah teaches that we designate a replacement for the wife of the Kohen Gadol, lest his wife die)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We were already taught regarding that Mishnah that extra measures were taken to insure the Kaparah of Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>AN ANIMAL AS A MECHITZAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Regardless of which concern we adopt, it is clear that the prohibition of using an animal is mid'Rabanan, and that, mid'Oraisa, an animal could be a Mechitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, then is there a Machlokes whether an animal receives Tum'ah when it serves as a grave cover?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We reject the explanations given by Abaye and R. Zeira (see 23a Para. 3.c and d.) and provide new explanations (by R. Acha b. Yakov) for the position of R. Meir forbidding he use of an animal as a Mechitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir holds that any Mechitzah which depends on air is not a Mechitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Alternately, R. Meir holds that anything which is not man-made cannot serve as a Mechitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When will these explanations differ?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the case of a wall supported by a balloon.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The first explanation would invalidate such a Mechitzah since it is supported with air.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>It is, however, man-made.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WRITING A GET ON AN ANIMAL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the rationale for R. Yosi ha'Gelili who taught (above 23a para. 3.a.2.) that Gitin may not be written on an animal?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa derives it from the requirement of Sefer, which is inanimate.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the rationale of the Rabanan who argue with R. Yosi ha'Gelili on this matter?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Sefer refers to the nature of the thing written, not to the material written upon (which would have been implied by <i>Ba</i>Sefer).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then how do the Rabanan, who do not need VeChasav to teach that other things (wood, leaves, etc) may be used (since Sefer does not limit the materials used), interpret VeChasav!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They learn from it that a woman may only be divorced with the writ, not with money (we might have derived this from Kidushin).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence will R. Yosi ha'Gelili learn this restriction?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the words Sefer Kerisus, teaching that only a Sefer, and not anything else (including money) may effect a divorce.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't the Rabanan learn this from Sefer Kerisus, as opposed to learning it from VeChasav?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Sefer Kerisus is needed to proscribe the use of conditions in a Get which would permanently bind the wife in the future (as taught in the Beraisa that a permanent [as opposed to a temporary] condition would invalidate the Get).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence will R. Yosi ha'Gelili derive this Din?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the expansion of the sufficient word Kares to the word Kerisus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What will the Rabanan do with this expansion?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They do not use the difference between Kares and Kerisus for this Derashah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MISHNAH: USING TREES AS MECHITZOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>It is permitted to use trees as the Mechitzos of a Sukah (where the Sechach does not rest on them).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>SWAYING OF THE TREES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Acha b. Yakov):</span> A Mechitzah must be able to withstand a normal wind.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But what of the swaying of the trees in our Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah speaks of firm trees.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the branches and leaves (which fill in the spaces of the walls) are subject to the wind?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The branches must be secured.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what is the news of our Mishnah which permits the use of trees as Mechitzos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have prohibited such a Sukah lest the person come to make use of the trees during Sukos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find that a tree may serve as a Mechitzah when we are looking for a corner Deyumad around a public well!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, too, its branches are secured.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a tree is a secured Mechitzah, then why, regarding the Halachos of Eiruvin, does it only permit the area of a Beis Sasayim (the underside of the tree should constitute an area which has been intentionally closed off for residence, which can be up to any size)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not designed to be a Mechitzah for the purpose of the area underneath it, rather it is a Mechitzah for the field which lies beyond it (which makes it an area closed off for non-residence which only permits a Beis Sasayim).</p></div>
