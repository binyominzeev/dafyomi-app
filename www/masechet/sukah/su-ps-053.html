<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The sages who had not tasted sin gave thanks for their youth which did not embarrass their old age, and those who had done Teshuvah would give thanks for that.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Both groups proclaimed the blessings of he who had not sinned, calling upon the sinner to then do Teshuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Hillel proclaimed in his joy, in Hash-m's name, Im Ani Kan...</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Hillel saw the skull and proclaimed...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> A person's own feet deliver him to the place he is to die, as demonstrated in the incident of the two Soferim whom Shlomo ha'Melech tried to save.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SIMCHAS BEIS HA'SHO'EVAH (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Shimon b. Gamliel would juggle eight torches.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>He alone was able to do Kidah (bowing on his thumbs, kissing the ground then stand up).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Levi did Kidah before Rebbi and became lame.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Elazar taught a different reason for Levi's becoming lame!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both factors contributed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Levi performed before Rebbi by juggling eight knives.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Shmuel performed before the Persian king with eight cups of wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Abaye juggled before Rabah with eight eggs (some say, four).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua b. Chananyah, a Levi):</span> We did not sleep during the Simchas Beis ha'Sho'evah (and he enumerated the activities of the Levi'im) 24 hours a day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But from Hilchos Nedarim we see that one cannot go three days without sleep.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we did not taste sleep because we only dozed on one another's shoulder.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE FIFTEEN STEPS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Chisda to the Amora of Agadah before him):</span> What is the source for Dovid ha'Melech's 15 Shir ha'Ma'alos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Amora citing R. Yochanan):</span> It was in order to bring Mei Tehom back up 15,000 Garmidi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Dovid ha'Melech dug the Shitin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The depth waters surged up and threatened to flood with world.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then they should not be called Ma'alos!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The waters went too low, as described.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Dovid did not decide regarding the permissibility of erasing Hash-m's name to stop the flood, deferring to Achitofel.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">53b----------------------------------------53b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Achitofel permitted it based on a Kal va'Chomer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>The waters went down too far, and Dovid ha'Melech elevated them with his Shirim to a depth of 1000 Garmidi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> This implies that the groundwater is at that depth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find water at much less depth!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That water comes from Sulma d'Fras.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE KOHANIM COMING DOWN TO THE TENTH STEP</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmiyah):</span> Did they come down ten steps, to the fifth, or five steps to the tenth?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Teiku.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>THEY TURNED THEIR BACKS ON HASH-M</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they faced eastward, is it not obvious that their backs were to the Heichal?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They would defecate in affront to Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>ANU L'KAH UL'KAH EINEINU</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Zeira taught that such repetition is forbidden (like Modim Modim)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [They bowed to the East while] we bow to Hash-m, and our eyes turn to Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE TEKI'OS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>There are not fewer than 21 Teki'os in the Mikdash and, on some days, it can be as many as 48, as enumerated.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>R. YEHUDAH AND RABANAN ON TEKI'OS AND TERU'OS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Our Mishnah seems to not follow R. Yehudah who taught that the minimum Teki'os is seven.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is their Machlokes?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah sees a set of Tekiah-Teruah-Tekiah as one Mitzvah, while Rabanan see each sound separately.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yehudah's rationale is the Pasuk Us'katem Teruah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Rabanan understand that Pasuk as obligating every Teruah to have a Tekiah before and after it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rabanan's rationale is the Pasuk which speaks of blowing Tekiah and not Teruah (when gathering the People) thus demonstrating that Tekiah and Teruah are separate Mitzvos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Yehudah counters saying that such Tekios are calling the People, but not as a Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Rabanan counter that this 'calling' is rendered a Mitzvah by the Pasuk!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then whom does the teaching of R. Kehana that there must be nothing but the briefest interruption (v'Lo Klum) between Tekiah and Teruah follow?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that is too obvious!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Without R. Kehana we might have misinterpreted the Rabanan as allowing (as per the view of R. Yochanan) long separations between Tekios.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps that is not an error and R. Kehana is teaching his Din even according to Rabanan!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The words v'Lo Klum preclude even the brief interruption allowable according to Rabanan.</p></div>
