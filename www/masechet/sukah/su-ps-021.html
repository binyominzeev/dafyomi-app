<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DEFINING AN <i>OHEL</i> (from the Mishnah in Ohalos)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> A hole that the water or rodents bored into the lower section of the banks of a river or which appeared there after the earth crumbled by itself, or a pile of stones or of beams where some of them formed an Ohel over others all have the Dinim of Tumas Ohel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> Only a man-made Ohel has the Din of Ohel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is learned as a Gezeirah Shavah (the shared word Ohel) from Mishkan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Tana Kama understands the extra words Ohel to add more types of Ohalos, including natural ones.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa indicates that, according to R. Yehudah, the backs of oxen (surely not man-made) create an Ohel!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>As one of the many precautions from Tum'ah mentioned regarding drawing water for the Parah Adumah, we learn that the children were brought to the Shiloach on the backs of oxen, with platforms attached upon which the children sat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This created an Ohel which protected the children from contracting Tum'ah from unknown Tum'ah in the ground beneath them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehudah taught that the children were borne on the oxen themselves, without the platforms.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Thus we see that R. Yehudah recognized a natural Ohel!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Dimi citing R. Elazar):</span> R. Yehudah concedes the existence of natural Ohalos when they are large (as seen in the cited Beraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find that R. Yehudah objected to the use of the platforms, presumably because this is not a normal way to make an Ohel!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> R. Yehudah did not mean that the platforms were invalid as Ohalos, but that they were not needed since the wide oxen served as Ohalos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> R. Yehudah meant that they did not use the platforms because the children were used to them (unafraid) and might look over their edge, exposing themselves to possible Tum'ah (whereas they would stay scared in their seats on the backs of the oxen).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>A Beraisa supports Rava in its report of R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could R. Yehudah permit sleeping under a bed?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Given its width, it should be an Ohel, just as the platform or the oxen constitute an Ohel!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Yet in our Mishnah it is not an intervening Ohel, while in the Mishnah regarding Parah Adumah it is!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A bed is made for use above it, thus negating the Ohel status of that which is below it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But oxen are also for use above them!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravin citing R. Elazar):</span> The underside of the oxen provides shade and rain-cover for the shepherd.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If that is why it is an Ohel below, then the same can be said of the bed which protects the shoes beneath it!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Rather, oxen are an Ohel below since their backs protect their lower parts (as in the Pasuk).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> R. Yehudah requires that a Sukah be a fixed dwelling and a bed is a temporary dwelling, which is not Mevatel the fixed dwelling above it (the Sukah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Shimon also requires a fixed dwelling yet he holds that a temporary dwelling does invalidate at fixed one!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, they are arguing over whether a temporary dwelling invalidates the fixed dwelling above it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>LESSONS FROM R. GAMLIEL AND FROM TAVI HIS SLAVE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa (like the Mishnah) learns the two lessons from the Sichah (conversation) of R. Gamliel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We typically speak of learning from his words (Devarav) not from his Sichah (conversation)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches us, inter alia, that even the casual conversations of the sages warrant analysis.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MISHNAH: A SUKAH ON A BED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> It is permitted to place Sechach on a bed with three walls of 10 Tefachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> If the Sukah could not stand independent of the bed it is Pesulah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MA'AMID L'SECHACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's rationale?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Machlokes (R. Zeira and R. Aba b. Mamel) whether the Pesul is because the bed is not fixed or because the Sukah is being supported by that which is Mekabel Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When will we see a difference between them?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When a Sukah is built on iron poles (which are fixed, but are Mekabel Tum'ah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The Pesul of R. Yehudah is only if the Sechach is resting on the bed, but if the beds are serving as the walls of the Sukah, while the Sechach is on Kosher poles, the Sukah is Kesheirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why would such a Sukah be Kesheirah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Either because the poles are fixed or because he is not resting the Sechach on that which is Mekabel Tum'ah.</p></div>
