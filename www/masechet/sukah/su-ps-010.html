<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>SUKAH ABOVE A SUKAH: PASUL AT WHAT DISTANCE?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> At what distance will the Sechach above invalidate the Sechach below?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Huna):</span> A Tefach (less than a Tefach does not create an Ohel for Tumas Mes, as we learn in the Mishnah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chisda and Rabah b. R. Huna):</span> Four Tefachim (since the minimum dimension for an independent domain is four Tefachim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> 10 Tefachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What would be his rationale?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pesul of a Sukah above should mirror its dimension for being Kosher (height of 10 Tefachim).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Rabanan who argue with R. Yehudah hold that the lower Sukah would be Pesulah even if the upper were <i>less</i> than 10 Tefachim in height!?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Yehudah taught in our Mishnah that if the upper Sukah does not have residents, the lower Sukah is Kesheirah (by which we infer that the Rabanan would hold that it is Pesulah).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>What is that case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>It cannot be simply that nobody is living in the Sukah above, since the Pesul cold not be dependant on the presence or absence of residents in the upper Sukah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>It must be that the upper Sukah is unfit (which permits the lower Sukah), and its lack of fitness must be due to its being shorter than 10 Tefachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p>Then Rabanan, who prohibit the lower Sukah in such a case, must hold that the upper Sukah invalidates even if it is less than 10 Tefachim in height!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Dimi):</span> The lack of fitness spoken of is the floor of the upper (which is the Sechach of the lower) being unfit for sleeping/eating upon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then we must infer that the Rabanan would hold that such an unfit upper Sukah would still invalidate the lower Sukah (and it still poses a question on Shmuel)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The argument between R. Yehudah and the Rabanan is not over a Sukah whose upper level cannot be used.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>All would agree that the lower Sukah would then be valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Rather, the argument is whether an upper Sukah which could be used, but with considerable difficulty, is considered a Sukah to invalidate the lower one (Rabanan) or not (R. Yehudah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MISHNAH: COVERINGS OVER AND UNDER THE SECHACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>If a sheet were spread over Kosher Sechach to supplement its shade or under the Sechach to catch thistles which might drop from the Sechach, the Sukah is thus invalidated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If such a decorative sheet were spread for decoration over the four posts of a bed, the person under such a spread is not considered as being in the Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If, however, the bed had two posts, one at the head and one at the foot, and the sheet hung at an angle like a tent from the bar (less than a Tefach wide) connecting the two posts, it is Kesheirah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SUKAH COVERINGS WHICH RENDER THE SUKAH PESULAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> The Pesul of the spread sheet is only if it is intended to catch thistles, but if it is intended to beautify the Sukah, it is Kesheirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is obvious, as the Mishnah explicitly states that the sheet was spread to catch droppings!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> I might have forbidden any sheet, and attributed the Mishnah's reference to droppings as using a common example.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa seems to support R. Chisda's teaching.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa is discussing deriving benefit from decorations hung from the Sukah, with or without a condition made at the time they were hung.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Among those adornments is a colorful sheet, and the Sukah is Kesheirah!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>That is not a support, since the sheet in the Beraisa could be understood to have been hung vertically (but be Pasul if hung under the Sechach) and R. Chisda permits the decorative covering <i>under</i> the Sechach.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE DECORATIVE SHEET UNDER THE SECHACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The decorative sheet under the Sechach does not reduce the height of the Sechach (to reduce the 20 Amos in Kosher range or to reduce the 10 Tefachim into Pasul range).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ashi):</span> But such vertical hangings do reduce the width of the Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Ashi's servant, Manimin, laid his wet coat to dry over the Sechach, and R. Ashi told him to remove it lest people think that he is using Sechach Pasul (Mekabel Tum'ah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The servant asked if that is true even though the coat is obviously wet and is there to be dried, not as Sechach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Ashi explained that he meant that the coat must be removed once it is dry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>There is a Machlokes whether a decorative sheet hung four Tefachim below the Sechach leaves the Sukah Kesheirah (R. Nachman) or renders it Pesulah (R. Chisda and Rabah bar R. Huna) [they differ on when the decoration is Batel to the Sechach].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>In the reported incident, R. Nachman seated R. Chisda and Rabah bar R. Huna beneath the hung sheet in the home of the exilarch.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>When they complied to sit there, R. Nachman asked them if they had retracted their earlier opposition to such a cover.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>They responded that they were exempt from Sukah owing to their mission, and that no such inference can be drawn.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE <i>KINUF</i> (four post bed) AND THE <i>NAKLITIN</i> (two posts)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> It is permitted to sleep under a covered Kilah (four posts, surrounding but unattached to the bed) in the Sukah, provided it is less than 10 Tefachim tall.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa teaches that one who sleeps in a Kilah has not fulfilled his obligation!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That speaks of a Kilah taller than 10 Tefachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Mishnah (2nd Perek) forbids sleeping under a bed!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel already taught that the Mishnah there refers to a bed which sits above 10 Tefachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But our Mishnah prohibits a Kinuf!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That, too, is over 10 Tefachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa does not seem to imply that it is speaking of Kinuf as being over 10 Tefachim!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa explains why, in our Mishnah, the Naklitin are permitted while the Kinufos are not permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Beraisa qualifies the permission regarding Naklitin as only if the top of the cover is less the 10 Tefachim taller than the bed, implying that the Kinufos are Pasul regardless of their height (which should apply to the Kilah the same way)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Kinufos are different, and more stringent, because the posts are fixed on the bed, rendering it an Ohel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But a Sukah above a Sukah (which surely is well fixed on top) is still subject (according to Shmuel) to the rule of 10 Tefachim (and why should Kinufos be stricter)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To invalidate a Sukah requires 10 Tefachim of height (in the upper Sukah), but to create an Ohel (as in the Kinuf) takes less (so long as it is fixed).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>SPEAKING DIVREI KEDUSHAH WHILE UNCLOTHED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One who is sleeping in a Kilah unclothed may stick his head outside the Kilah and recite Shema (the Kilah is viewed as his clothes, not as an Ohel).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa prohibits this practice!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is when the Kilah is taller than 10 Tefachim (and is thus considered an Ohel, and his head is viewed as being where his body is).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>This is supported by the continuation of the Beraisa, which compares this person in a Kilah to one who is in a house.</p></div>
