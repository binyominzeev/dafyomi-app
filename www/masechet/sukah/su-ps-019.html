<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ABAYE AND RAVA ON <i>PI TIKRAH</i> (as learned in Sura)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah indicates that we do not say Pi Tikrah (since, if we did, the courtyard Sukah would be Kosher)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava explaining for Abaye):</span> Our Mishnah invalidates the courtyard Sukah when he placed the Sechach level with the overhangs, not lying on top of them (this leaves nothing visible on which to say Pi Tikrah Yored ve'Sosem).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ABAYE AND RAVA ON PI TIKRAH (as learned in Pumbedisa)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>All agree that Sechach placed on an Achsadra without uprights is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If it has uprights it is Kosher (Lavud).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It is still Pasul (Lavud does not apply here since the uprights were not made for the Sukah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Halachah is like Rava in the first Lashon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Ashi was surprised to find R. Kahana making a Sukah in the way that Rava just invalidated (with two adjacent walls, but no third wall of one Tefach, thus relying on Pi Tikrah for the third wall).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Kahana pointed out a third wall consisting of one Tefach which jutted out into the adjoining porch, and which could be seen by people standing outside the Sukah but not by those who were standing inside (we learned in Eruvin that a Lechi, like the uprights, is Kosher, and permits carrying in a Mavoy).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>PESEL HA'YOTZEI MIN HA'SUKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What constitutes a Pesel ha'Yotzei which is considered part of the Sukah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> It refers to Sechach which protrudes to an area behind the middle wall of the Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that area would need three walls!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It has them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that area must be seven by seven Tefachim!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the area must have more shade than sunshine!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It has.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then what is the news of Pesel ha'Yotzei!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even though the middle wall was not made for this Sukah (it was made for the Sechach on the other side) it is still Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah and R. Yosef):</span> It refers to Sechach which extends from inside the Sukah but when only one of the walls fully extends to the length of the Sechach (i.e. that section of Sukah only has one wall and we might have invalidated it on that basis).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah citing R. Yochanan):</span> It refers to a case where the majority of the Sechach casts more shade than sunshine and a minority does not (the minority [called Pesel] is Kosher even though it is not in the [Hechsher] Sukah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Oshiya):</span> It refers to Sechach Pasul of less than three Tefachim in a minimum small Sukah (even though it has left the [laws of] Sukah, it is still Kosher).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Hoshaya):</span> It should not differ from the same amount of open space in the Sechach of a minimum Sukah (which we already know does not invalidate)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One may not sleep under a space of even less than three Tefachim in a small Sukah, whereas under Sechach Pasul of less than three Tefachim sleeping is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where do we find anything which contributes to the Shiur of something Kosher but is, itself, not Kosher!?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Soft mud is itself not Kosher, yet it complements the deficient Shiur of water in a Mikvah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MISHNAH: SECHACH AT AN ANGLE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> A Sukah which is shaped like a tent or which is angled against a wall is Pasul (its roof cannot be differentiated from its walls).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> It is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>METHODS FOR CORRECTING THE PROBLEM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Eliezer concedes that one could raise the Sukos of the Mishnah one Tefach from the ground</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The leaning Sukah may be corrected by moving the top of the Sechach one Tefach away from the wall.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the rationale of the Chachamim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They hold that a sloping Ohel is considered an Ohel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>In the reported incident, R. Yosef justified the fact that he was sleeping under a Kilas Chasanim in a Sukah because he saw in a Beraisa, that R. Eliezer and the Chachamim switched their opinions, in which case, he was following the opinion of the Chachamim (and not of R. Eliezer).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But why did R. Yosef give credence to the Beraisa over the Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because from another Beraisa, he learned that the author of our Mishnah is a lone opinion (R. Nasan quoting R. Eliezer) and that the Chachamim disagree.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>MISHNAH: REED MATS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> A large reed mat that is made to sleep on, is subject to Tum'ah, and is Pasul for Sechach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If it was made to be Sechach it may be used, and is not susceptible to Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> Regardless of size, it depends only on the intent with which it was made (as bedding or Sechach).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>UNSPECIFIED REED MATS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah seems to create a contradictory implication!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>From the Reisha we infer that a mat made without any particular intention it is not subject to Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>From the Seifa we infer that if it is made without specific intent it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Reisha speaks of a large mat (larger than needed for sleeping), and the Seifa of a small one.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the words of R. Eliezer create the same contradictory inference!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We cannot say that the first part of his statement speaks of large mats and the second of small, since he says explicitly that regardless of size, only intent matters!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> All agree that a large mat is normally meant for Sechach (and is not therefore subject to Tum'ah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tana Kama holds that a small mat (which he does not mention in the Mishnah) which is made S'tam, is subject to Tum'ah and is Sechach Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer maintains that a small mat has the same Din as a large one in this regard.</p></div>
