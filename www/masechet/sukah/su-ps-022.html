<p class="dedicationbox">SUKAH 22 (25 Adar I) - Dedicated by Nathan Fishman in memory of his father, Mordechai ben Aharon Fishman z'l, in honor of his Yahrzeit. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISHNAH: SUKAH MEDUVLELES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A Sukah Meduvleles (to be explained) and/or whose shade is greater than its sun is/are Kesheirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If the Sechach is very thick (even though stars cannot be seen from within) the Sukah is Kesheirah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MEDUVLELES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Meduvleles?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> A 'poor' Sukah (thin Sechach).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> One whose Sechach is 'mixed,' laid one piece high and one low.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Rav taught 1.a. (above) as one case (it is Kosher even though it is thin provided that its shade exceeds its light).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Shmuel taught it as two cases (mixed as one Kosher case; shade exceeding light as a second Kosher case).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CHAVOT RAMI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The Heter of Shmuel only applies if the higher and lower pieces are not separated by three Tefachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Heter applies even if they are three Tefachim apart, provided that each plank is a Tefach wide.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If less, then they need to be within three Tefachim of one another.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This Heter is based on the principle of Chavot Rami.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> My source for limiting Chavot Rami to a board whose width is one Tefach is the Mishnah in Ohalos and the Beraisa taught regarding that Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah provides the Halachah in every permutation where a two-story structure has beams in the ceiling of each story.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Tum'ah is either allowed to flow upward or is blocked by the Ohel created by the boards.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If the boards of the two stories are aligned with one another, then Tum'ah rises unimpeded; if the upper boards are above the spaces between the lower boards, then Tum'ah anywhere in the building is trapped as though it were all one room.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The Beraisa qualifies the Mishnah as applying when the boards and the spaces between them are a Tefach wide, in order to allow for Chavot Rami.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Ashi of R. Kehana who had just reported Rava's assertion):</span> But we see in the Beraisa that there is Chavot Rami even with less than a Tefach width!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa permits incomplete Koros at the entrance to a Mavoy with three (or, according to R. Shimon b. Gamliel, four) Tefachim of space in between.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Twin Koros, each less than the minimum Tefach width, may be combined.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Shimon b. Gamliel permits a space between the two twin Koros, provided they are strong enough to hold an Ariach (half-brick).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If the two twin Koros were at a different height, then R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah teaches that we view them as at the same height, provided that the upper Korah is not above 20 Amos, and the lower one is not below 10 Tefachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>It would thus appear that we are permitting Koros of less than a Tefach to combine through Chavot Rami!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Kehana):</span> The Koros must be within three Tefachim of one another (using Lavud, since we do not say Chavot Rami with such narrow boards), and the Beraisa is only reminding us of the minimum and maximum permitted height for Koros.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SHADE EXCEEDING LIGHT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah implies that were the shade and light to be equal, the Sukah is Pesulah, while the earlier Mishnah implies that equal shade and light is Kesheirah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is Pesulah if equal at the Sechach level and Kesheirah if it is equal at the ground-shade level (since the shade must be greater at the Sechach level).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>SECHACH AS THICK AS A ROOF</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A Sukah is still Kesheirah even if the stars are not visible.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If sunlight does not penetrate the Sechach it is Pasul according to Beis Shamai and Kosher according to Beis Hillel.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>MISHNAH: A SUKAH WHICH IS MOVABLE OR IN A TREE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A Sukah built on a wagon or boat is Kesheirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>On a tree or a camel is Kesheirah, but may not be entered on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If one or more of its walls are in the tree, even if the second or third are on the ground, it is viewed as in the tree and may not be entered on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If three walls are on the ground we are not concerned if the fourth wall is supported by the tree.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The Sukah is tested by checking if it could stand without the tree.</p></div>
