<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> A round Sukah is Kosher if its circumference is large enough to contain 24 people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan's requirement aligns with no other opinion, even the largest opinion (Rebbi, who says that any Sukah which is not 4x4 Amos is Pasul)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A person can sit in a space of 1 Amah (thus R. Yochanan's 24 people must be 24 Amos).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But we know that the relationship of the circumference to the diameter is 3 to 1.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Then taking the largest requirement for the width of a Sukah, Rebbi's (four Amos), it should suffice to have a circumference of only 12 Amos (not 24)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This relationship between the circumference and diameter applies only to a circle.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The perimeter of a square, though, is larger than the ratio of 3:1.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Thus in order to have a circle which has a circumference equal to the perimeter of a 4 X 4 Amos square, the circle must be larger than 12 Amos in circumference].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that still does not give us 24!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A square is a fourth (25%) larger than a circle (Rashi: a circular Amah is surrounded by a 3 Amah circumference, while a square Amah is surrounded by a 4 Amah perimeter).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It should then suffice to have a circumference of only 16 Amos (and still not 24)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This formula (that a square is 25% larger than a circle) applies only to a circle which is inscribed within a square.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The diameter of the inscribed circle is equal to the length of a side of the square.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, the size of a circle which is circumscribed around a square (i.e. the square is inside the circle, such that the diameter of the circle is equal to the diagonal of the square) must be larger, because of the arcs of the circle.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that would still give us only 16 4/5 Amos!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The relationship of a side of a square to its diagonal is 1 to 1 2/5.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Thus, the diagonal of the square, which is the same as the diameter of the circle around it, is 4 X 1 2/5 = 5 3/5.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Since the circumference of a circle is 3 times its diameter, the circumference of this circle is 5 3/5 X 3 = 16 4/5).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>It should then suffice to have a circumference of only 16 4/5 Amos (and still not 24)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan was not exact in his number.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We only say that one was not exact in his number when the difference is small, not when it is so large (24 vs. 16 4/5)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Mar Kashisha):</span> R. Yochanan's number was based on the assumption that 3 persons fit in 2 Amos (not one person in one Amah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, R. Yochanan was saying that the size of the circumference of the round Sukah needs to be only 16 Amos (3 person in 2 Amos = 24 persons in 16 Amos), yet we concluded that the circle around a square which is 4 X 4 Amos must have a circumference of 16 4/5 Amos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan was not exact in his number.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We only say that one was not exact in his number when he was rounding off to a figure that would be stringent.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Here R. Yochanan (who says that the circumference must be 16) is rounding off to a figure that would be lenient.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This would allow for a smaller Sukah than actually required!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Asi):</span> R. Yochanan was not including the place where the person sits, which makes the measured circumference 18, not 24.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan's number was indeed based on the assumption that one person fits in one Amah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, R. Yochanan was not including in the size of the Sukah the place which the sitting person occupies.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rather, the Sukah is measured from <i>within</i> (or inside) the place where the person sits.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Hence, if 24 people sit around the Sukah and we do not include the Amah in which they sit, the circumference of the circle comes out to be 18 (Rashi: we subtract two Amos from the diameter of the circle [one Amah on each 'side' of the Sukah] leaving a diameter of 6. The circumference of such a circle is 18).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we determined that it is enough to have a circumference of 16 4/5 Amos (and not 18)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is where R. Yochanan was not exact in his number, and his inexactness was a Chumra.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The circle that comes out from within a square is a fourth (25%) smaller than the square around it.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The square that comes out from within a circle is one half (50%) smaller than the circle around it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is not so, for we see that the circle circumscribed around a square is not so much larger. (Question remains unanswered. See Insights)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>FULFILLING THE MITZVAH WITH SUKOS BUILT FOR OTHER PURPOSES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Levi citing R. Meir):</span> The inner Sukah of a Potter (used for residence) is not Kosher as a Sukah, and it requires a Mezuzah, because it is the place in which he lives all year long.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The outer Sukah (used as his shop and store) is a Kosher Sukah, and is exempt from a Mezuzah, because it is not normally used as his residence.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the outer Sukah exempt from a Mezuzah (it should be like an entrance hall to a house, which requires a Mezuzah)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the whole structure is permanent, we only go as far as to obligate the residence Sukah in Mezuzah, not to consider the outer Sukah as its entrance hall.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Sukos of GaNVa"Ch - The Sukos of Goyim, Nashim, Behemah, Kusim,- and any Sukah (not made for the Mitzvah) are Kosher, as long as it has Halachic Sechach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is particular about these as needing <i>Halachic</i> Sechach?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chisda):</span> The Sechach must have been placed on the Sukah to provide shade (not only for privacy).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is added by "any Sukah?"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes the Sukos of RaKVa"Sh, as in the following Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Sukos of RaKVa"Sh - The Sukos of Ro'im, Kayatzim, Burganin, Shomrei Peros,- and any Sukah are Kosher, as long as it has Halachic Sechach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Halachic Sechach?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chisda):</span> The Sechach must have been placed on the Sukah for shade (not only for privacy).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is "any Sukah" adding?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It adds the Sukos of GaNVa"Ch as we learned in the earlier Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did each Tana specify one group of Sukos and add the other group with "any Sukah?"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Each specifies the group of Sukos more likely to be considered Kosher, and adds the less likely group in the "any Sukah."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Tana held that the Sukos of GaNVa"Ch have the Halachic advantage of being more permanent, compared to the RaKVa"Sh Sukos which are, at times, not even left standing for seven days, (so he needed to add the RaKVa"Sh Sukos as Kosher).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The second Tana held that the Sukos of RaKVa"Sh have the advantage of being used by people who are Chayav in the Mitzvah of Sukah (and he thus adds the Sukos of GaNVa"Ch which are used by those who are Peturim).</p></div>
