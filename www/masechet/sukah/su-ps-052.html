<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As R. Yehudah expounded, the Tzadikim will cry in disbelief that they overcame this mountain while the Reshaim will cry in their dismay over not overcoming this tiny force.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Huna):</span> One Pasuk refers to succumbing to the Yetzer simply as an error, and one Pasuk speaks of an internal success in distorting the person.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> But for the three Pesukim in which Hash-m "takes blame" for the Yetzer and for correcting its effect on our hearts, we would have no hope.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Sheshes):</span> Then why does the Pasuk refer to these as scatterers when we know them to be gatherers?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chana):</span> Read the end of the Pasuk and you will see that the scatterers are the nations whom the four shepherds attack.</p></div>
