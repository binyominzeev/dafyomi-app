<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>HOW PRI ETZ HADAR REFERS TO ESROG</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Its fruit and tree have the same taste.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this refers to Pilpelin?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Meir taught that Pilpelin has this quality.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>In addition, we are taught that it is obligated in Orlah, and that the Land is not missing anything.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Pilpelin are impossible to use since one would not even be noticed, and taking many would violate the singular language of the Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> It is like a Dir (Hadar) which has different sizes, shapes and ages of flock, like the Esrog tree.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But most fruit trees have such variety!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We mean that the large ones are still on the tree when the small ones come out.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> It can reside (Dar like Hadar) on its tree from year to year.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ben Azai):</span> It is water-based (Hadar alludes to the Greek Hydro) as it requires constant irrigation.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE PESUL OF ASHEIRAH AND IR HA'NIDACHAS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Its Shiur is reduced below the minimum given that it must be burnt.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>AN ESROG OF ORLAH IS PASUL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Orlah Pasul?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Machlokes R. Chiyah b. Avin and R. Asi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It may not be eaten (and hence fails on Lachem).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It has no value (and Lachem implies value).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We wanted to assume that the reasons are exclusive but then how can we explain the Pesul of Terumah Temeiah (which has value but no Heter Achilah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Heter Achilah is the minimum requirement, and the other opinion adds value as another requirement.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When will the opinions create a distinction in Halachah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the use of Ma'aser Sheni in Yerushalayim, according to R. Meir (who sees Ma'aser Sheni as Mamon Gavo'ah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It certainly has Heter Achilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It has no value according to R. Meir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>From the Din of R. Meir which R. Asi cited, we should conclude that R. Asi held that it requires value.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In the case of Ma'aser Sheni, R. Meir is cited by R. Asi as disallowing the Esrog while the Chachamim permit it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This, indeed, establishes the position of R. Asi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Papa):</span> R. Asi cites two other items which R. Meir discounts and the Chachamim include, but Matzah does not fit the pattern!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Matzah of Ma'aser Sheni regarding the Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A dough of Ma'aser Sheni regarding Chalah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Dough is associated with Arisoseichem, as Lachem by Esrog, implying that personal ownership is a requirement.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>But there is no word by Matzah to imply personal possession!?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">35b----------------------------------------35b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is connected by the word Lechem to Chalah, (from which a dough of Ma'aser Sheni is Patur) hence it must be yours.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May R. Asi find support in the Beraisa cited regarding a dough of Ma'aser Sheni?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer and Question:</span> Is that a question!? That is our very case!!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our question was whether the Machlokes regarding a dough would also apply to Esrog, or whether a dough has <i>two</i> references to possession and thus may not generalize to Esrog.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>AN ESROG OF TERUMAH TEMEI'AH IS PASUL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>It lacks a Heter Achilah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>AN ESROG OF TERUMAH TEHORAH SHOULD NOT BE USED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The reason is a Machlokes R. Ami and R. Asi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Its use would likely make it Muchshar to receive Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Its use would likely cause its deterioration, as the skin wears down from handling.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When will the opinions create a distinction in Halachah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he excluded the skin when making it Terumah (it still could be exposed to Tum'ah, but it would not be affected by the handling).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>IF USED, IT IS KOSHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>It satisfies both opinions (Heter Achilah and value).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>DEMAI IS A MACHLOKES BEIS HILLEL AND BEIS SHAMAI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Beis Hillel permit Demai?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the owner could make himself an Ani and be entitled to use Demai, we view him as such, even now (as the Mishnah permits feeding Demai to the poor).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Beis Shamai prohibit Demai?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They hold that a poor man may not eat Demai (as R. Huna taught that the matter is subject to Machlokes).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>AN ESROG OF MA'ASER SHENI SHOULD NOT BE USED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>It could both become Muchshar, as well as deteriorate.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>IF USED, IT IS KOSHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>If the requirement is Heter Achilah, then the Din is the opinion of both R. Meir and Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If the requirement is also value, then the opinion is only the Chachamim (since, according to R. Meir, Ma'aser Sheni is Mamon Gavo'ah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">10)</span><p>CHAZAZIS ON THE MAJORITY OF ITS SKIN MAKES IT PASUL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chisda, reverently citing Rav):</span> It is Pasul only if the Chazazis is found in one place, but not if it is found in two or three places.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> But surely two or three places is worse, rendering it Menumar (leopard-like)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the statement of Rav should be applied to the Seifah, where a minority of Chazazis is Kosher, only if it appears in one place, not if it appears in two or three places, where it makes it Menumar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Even a tiny Chazazis on the Chotam (where it begins to become slimmer) is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">11)</span><p>THE PITAM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The word used by R. Yitzchak b. Elazar is Bochan (see Rashi).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">12)</span><p>NIKLAF</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A skinned Esrog which turned ruddy is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Mishnah taught that Niklaf is Pasul!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If it is entirely skinned it is Kosher; partially skinned (creating multiple colors) is Pasul.</p></div>
