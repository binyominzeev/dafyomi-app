<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>LULAV ON SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Lulav in the Mikdash not waved also on Shabbos Chol ha'Moed (what Melachah are we protecting)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> It is prohibited lest he carry the Lulav out to receive instruction in its use.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The same Gezeirah holds by Shofar and Megilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A person might take them out for instruction.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then Lulav should be prohibited on the first day, as well, lest he carry it out!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is no concern since Rabanan instituted, for safety, that the Lulavim should be kept home (which will remind people not to carry them out).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But what about before the Takanah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first day was not subject to a Gezeirah since it is Chashuv (because it applies everywhere unlike the other days when the Lulav is d'Oraisa only in the Mikdash).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then there should not be Gezeirah on the first day nowadays, either (it is Chashuv)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are not certain which is the first day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then let those in Eretz Yisrael wave the Lulav on the first day which falls on Shabbos!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, they do (but see 44a for the Maskanah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is supported by resolving our Mishnah (where they brought their Lulavim to the Mikdash before Shabbos) and the Beraisa (where they brought them to the Beis ha'Kneses).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One must speak when the Mikdash was standing, and one after the Churban!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>LULAV B'GEVULIN ON THE FIRST DAY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence the obligation to take the Lulav on the first day even outside of the Mikdash?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa derives it as one of the Derashos from the Pasuk u'Lekachtem Lachem...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need a Derashah to permit Lulav on Shabbos (what Melachah is there)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We need it to permit Machshirei Lulav (in accordance with R. Eliezer who permits cutting, etc., in preparation for the Mitzvah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Eliezer's rationale?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The extra word BaYom in our Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will Rabanan (who disagree with the permission taught by R. Eliezer) interpret BaYom?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It restricts Lulav to daytime.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence will R. Eliezer learn that limit?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is implied by the word Yamim at the end of the Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will Rabanan interpret that Yamim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To the contrary, that Yamim would lead us (by linking it to Sukah) to apply Lulav by day and night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Maybe Sukah is only by day?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa asserts that it is day and night.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Maybe Yamim refers only to daytime (by linking Sukah to Yamim by Lulav)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yamim links Sukah to the seven days of Miluim (which were day and night).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why link Sukah to Miluim, link it rather to Lulav!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more logical to link it to another Mitzvah which is all day long (unlike Lulav which is only once a day).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it is more reasonable to link it to another Mitzvah which is permanent (Lulav, unlike the one-time Miluim)?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">43b----------------------------------------43b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The word Teshvu links it definitively to Miluim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE ARAVAH OVERRIDES SHABBOS ON THE SEVENTH DAY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should the Aravah override Shabbos (and not be subject to the Gezeirah applied to Lulav)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The Gezeirah was not applied to Aravah to publicize its Torah origins.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then the same should hold by the Lulav!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Lulav is subject to the Gezeirah (taught by Rabah, lest one carry it out for instruction).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The same should hold for the Aravah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Aravah is brought to the Mikdash by agents of Beis Din and used by the Kohanim, for whom we do not need to apply Gezeiros (unlike Lulav which is taken by all).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then the Aravah should override Shabbos whenever it falls, not only on the seventh day!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It would then overshadow Lulav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then let it override Shabbos on the first day (not the last) just like Lulav?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah origins would not be publicized thereby (people would attribute the bringing of the Aravah to the permission associated with Lulav).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Aravah should override Shabbos on another day?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Once we removed it from the first day, we give it another day of distinction.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>ARAVAH OVERRIDING SHABBOS NOWADAYS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Let Aravah override nowadays on Shabbos, as well (to publicize its Torah origins)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are not certain which is the first day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What of those in Eretz Yisrael?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (b. Hedya):</span> The seventh day of Sukos may never fall on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravin and his entourage):</span> It happens, and it does not override Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then again, why not?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosef):</span> The Mitzvah of Aravah is to lean it against the Mizbe'ach, which cannot be done nowadays.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> But our Mishnah groups Lulav and Aravah together, presumably, because they are both waved!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosef):</span> That grouping is not compelling.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah later reports that they walked around the Mizbe'ach once each day, and seven times on the last day, presumably with the Aravah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosef):</span> No, it is with the Lulav, while the Aravah is leaning against the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Nachman (citing Rabah b. Avuha) taught that they went around with the Aravah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosef):</span> Indeed he holds that, but I hold that they went around with the Lulav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This Machlokes is between R. Elazar (with the Lulav) and R. Shmuel b. Nasan citing R. Chaninah (with the Aravah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Nachman citing Rabah b. Avuha agrees with Aravah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rava reported to R. Yitzchak b. Rabah bar bar Chanah that his father held it was with the Lulav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the implication of the reported incident (where the Baisusim buried the Aravos) is that they waved the Aravah (not only leaned it against the Mizbe'ach)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, this refutes R. Yosef.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then the Netilah should override Shabbos!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since those outside of Eretz Yisrael do not override Shabbos (because of the doubt regarding the date), those in Eretz Yisrael refrain, as well.</p></div>
