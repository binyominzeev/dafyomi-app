<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE EIMUREI HA'REGALIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Eimurim are not distributed, they are burnt!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chisda):</span> It refers to that which is taught regarding the Eimurei Regalim (that every Kohen has equal rights in the Korbanos of the Regalim, and only of the Regalim).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>EQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE LECHEM HA'PANIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for equally dividing the Lechem ha'Panim among all the Mishmaros?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chelek k'Chelek teaches that just as they are equal in the Avodah, they are equal in Achilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Achilah is being referred to?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Eating the Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that is learned from the Pasuk LaKohen ha'Makriv Osa Lo Sihyeh!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Chelek k'Chelek teaches about allocating the Lechem ha'Panim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>The Beraisa goes on to exclude other Chovos (unrelated to the Regel) from equal allocation.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Rather, those Korbanos go to the Mishmar of that week (Mimkarav - that which was bartered between the Batei Av of the Kohanim, ie. the Mishamaros).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SUKAH AND THEN SHE'HECHEYANU, OR THE REVERSE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Recite Leshev ba'Sukah, then Shehechiyanu (Z'man).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Z'man then Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav's rationale):</span> Chiyuv of the day comes first.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Tadir takes precedence.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This Machlokes seems to be originally between Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> Sanctification of Shabbos then wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> Wine then Yom (Kidush).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Two rationales for Beis Shamai:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Yom causes the wine to precede the Seudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The Day is Kodesh (on its own) even before the wine is introduced.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Two rationales for Beis Hillel:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Without wine he could not say Kidush.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Tadir takes precedence.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Rav appears to follow Beis Shamai and Rabah bar bar Chanah follows Beis Hillel!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> My position could follow Beis Hillel as we see that Tadir alone was not enough to place wine first (he needed another reason).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> My position could follow Beis Shamai since the Yom causes the wine, whereas by Sukah the Z'man is independent, and would be said even by those who were exempt from Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (on Rav):</span> The Mishnah puts the Tadir ahead of the Chovas ha'Yom (Lechem ha'Panim [Matzah] is distributed before the Shtei ha'Lechem [Chametz])!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> It is a Machlokes Tanaim (Aba Shaul says that the Chametz was given out before the Matzah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman bar R. Chisda):</span> We recite Z'man and then Sukah (unlike Rav).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Sheshes brei d'Rav Idi):</span> Sukah then Z'man.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>The Halachah is Sukah then Z'man (like Rav).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE SET MISHMAR ALSO RECEIVES THE OTHER KORBENOS TZIBUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To what Korbanos does this phrase refer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Par He'elem Davar and Se'irei Avodah Zarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does the phrase <i>Makriv Es ha'Kol</i> add?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Kayitz ha'Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>MISHNAH: EARLY AND LATE MISHMAROS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>When Shabbos precedes or follows Yom Tov, all the Mishmaros share in the Lechem ha'Panim of that Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>When a day intervenes, the early or remaining Mishmaros take only two of the twelve Lechem ha'Panim (whereas normally it is divided six and six between the incoming and outgoing Mishmaros).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> It is normally seven (incoming) and five (outgoing).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The incoming Mishmar receives from the North; outgoing from the South.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The Mishmar Bilgah always gets from the South; its Taba'as was sealed (so the animal's head could not be placed inside) and its window (for storing their knives) was closed.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>SHABBOS BEFORE AND AFTER YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is <i>before</i> and <i>after</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Before means the Shabbos following the first day of Yom Tov (or Shabbos Chol ha'Moed); and after means the last Yom Tov follows Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that is the same as Shabbos within the Chag, which does not teach us anything about the equal allocation on the Shabbos approaching the Chag!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Before must mean the last day of Yom Tov falls on Erev Shabbos and after refers to the first day of Yom Tov falling after Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we institute this equal distribution?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishmaros must be there (and remain for the following Shabbos since they cannot travel on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">56b----------------------------------------56b</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>R. YEHUDAH TEACHES SEVEN AND FIVE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why the extra two for the incoming Mishmar?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> For closing the gates which the outgoing Mishmar had opened.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Let the outgoing Mishmar tell the incoming Mishmar to abolish this practice, and rather give six now and receive six at the end of their week, rather than take seven now only to lose two at week's end!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Take the small gourd offered now, rather than wait for a potentially larger gift later.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>THE HIDES OF THE MUSAF KEVASIM ON SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> These hides are divided equally between the outgoing and incoming Mishmaros.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa teaches that the outgoing Mishmar does the morning Tamid and Musaf while the incoming Mishmar does the afternoon Tamid and the Bazichin, and there is no mention of the hides!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Tana was not dealing with allocations!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> But even the Beraisa dealing with allocations (Tana d'vei Shmuel) does not mention the hides!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refutes R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The incoming Mishmar takes from the North (the main area, where Kodeshei Kodoshim are slaughtered) to indicate that they are arriving while the outgoing Mishmar shows they are leaving by taking from the South.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>THE MISHMAR OF BILGAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The terrible acts of a daughter of this Mishmar led to their privileges being revoked.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Others say it was because they would procrastinate in coming, indicating their disdain for the Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In their absence, Yeshvav took their place.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Even though neighbors of evil people generally lose out, in this case they profited.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>While Bilgah always took from the South, Yeshvav always received in the North.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should the whole Mishmar be penalized for one wayward daughter?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> This is correct, since a child imitates its parents.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then the whole Mishmar is punished owing to one set of derelict parents!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Woe to the evil one and woe to his neighbor (as we see by the stones of the house of the Metzora and his neighbor) and weal to the righteous and to his neighbor (proof text).</p></div>
