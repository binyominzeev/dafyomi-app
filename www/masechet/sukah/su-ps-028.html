<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE QUESTIONS ASKED OF R. ELIEZER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> R. Eliezer was asked 30 questions regarding the laws of Sukah, 12 of which he responded to as having heard them from his teachers, and 18 he did not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> He reported having heard 18 and had not heard 12.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Eliezer was asked if, indeed, he is so careful not to say anything which he did not hear from his teacher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Eliezer responded (being forced to speak about himself, something which he did not hear from his teachers) listing his personal attributes, including the fact that he never said anything which he had not heard from his teachers.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>A similar and even larger list of qualities is attributed to R. Yochanan b. Zakai, upon whom R. Eliezer modeled his qualities.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Of the 80 students of the great Hillel (whose strengths are described), R. Yochanan b. Zakai was the least.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa goes on to list every area of knowledge which R. Yochanan b. Zakai had mastered.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If this was true of the least of Hillel's disciples, what could be imagined of the greatest of them, Yonasan b. Uziel!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It is said of Yonasan b. Uziel that birds flying overhead were singed when he studied.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MISHNAH: SUKAH OBLIGATIONS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One must have his head, the majority of his body and his table in the Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Shamai invalidates the Sukah if his table is within the house.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel allows this arrangement.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Beis Hillel attempt to support their position citing the elders who silently acquiesced while R. Yochanan b. HaChornis sat with his table in the house.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Beis Shamai respond that indeed all the visitors told R. Yochanan b. HaChornis that he could not have fulfilled his Mitzvah in this manner.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Women, slaves and minors are exempt from Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A boy who no longer needs his mother is obligated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Elder Shamai made a Sukah above his daughter-in- law's bed to provide a Sukah for her child.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE EXEMPTION OF WOMEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for their exemption?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Heh of ha'Ezrach excludes women, while Kol includes minors.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are we to thus infer that Ezrach without the Heh would imply both men and women, contrary to the Beraisa (where ha'Ezrach comes in <i>include</i> women in the afflictions of Yom Kipur)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> The Heh can either include or exclude, but the matter is decided through Halachah l'Moshe mi'Sinai and then attributed to the Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which, Sukah or Yom Kipur, is derived from the Pasuk itself, and which comes from Halachah l'Moshe mi'Sinai?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Additional Question:</span> We do not need either of these, given that Sukah is time tied, thus exempting women, and a woman's obligation to abstain on Yom Kipur is learned from the Pasuk (as taught by R. Yehudah citing Rav)!?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">28b----------------------------------------28b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Ezrach means men, and ha'Ezrach should include women, who are exempt because of the Halachah l'Moshe mi'Sinai.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need a tradition to exempt women from Sukah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> We might have obligated them as part of the obligation to dwell in the Sukah as one would dwell in his home, with his wife.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We might have obligated women due to the existing connection between the night of Sukos and the night of Pesach, where women are obligated to eat Matzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Sukah is Halachah l'Moshe mi'Sinai, then what, indeed, does the Heh in the Pasuk teach us?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes converts (whom we might have excluded due to the word Yisrael in the Pasuk).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need a Pasuk to include women in Yom Kipur, given the teaching of R. Yehudah citing Rav?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To include women in the minutes added to Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We might have exempted women from these minutes given that they are not subject to the warnings and punishments of Yom Kipur itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This lesser status might be translated into an exemption for women which the Pasuk precludes.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>'KOL' TO INCLUDE MINORS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Mishnah exempts minors!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The inclusion speaks of minors who are educable, while the exemption refers to those younger.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the obligation of educable minors in Mitzvos is mid'Rabanan, and is surely is not derived from a Pasuk!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed it is mid'Rabanan, and the Pasuk is only used as an Asmachta.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>A MINOR WHO NO LONGER NEEDS HIS MOTHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is a minor considered independent of his mother?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Bei R. Yanai):</span> When he can clean himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Additional Answer (Resh Lakish):</span> When he awakes and does not call out for his mother.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But even older children may call out for their mother upon awakening!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We mean that he calls out repeatedly until his mother responds.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>THE GRANDSON OF SHAMAI THE ELDER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The cited incident (wherein Shamai prepared a Sukah for his grandson) contradicts the very law of Mishnah (exempting minors) which it is supposed to illustrate!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> By emending the Mishnah we learn that minors are exempt, but Shamai was stringent regarding minors.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>MISHNAH: RAIN ON THE SUKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One's principle residence is in the Sukah for seven days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rain exempts one from the Sukah once porridge would spoil from it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rainfall on Sukos is analogous to a servant who gave the cup to his master and who spilled it in his face.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>TESHVU K'EIN TADURU</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for the Sukah obligations listed in the Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The word Teshvu is understood to mean reside as one would in one's house, including in-depth study.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rava taught that, while lesser learning takes place in the Sukah, in-depth study takes place outside?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One speaks of reviewing that which is known to him, and the exemption speaks of in-depth analysis which one may do where he is most comfortable.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The concept of these two levels of study is illustrated by Rava and Rami b. Chama.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>After hearing the Shiur from R. Chisda they would briefly overview all of the covered points, and only then analyze them in-depth.</p></div>
