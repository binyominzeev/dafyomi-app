<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> A spontaneous fast is only valid if he fasted all day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Obviously that is a perfectly valid and normal fast!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to a case where after not having eaten in the morning he spontaneously decided to fast all day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> A fast is only valid if it lasts until sunset.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Mishnah says that the men of the Mishmar would fast for only part of the day!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They fast simply in solidarity with the community.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We find that one family of Kohanim, when Tish'ah b'Av was delayed until Sunday, only fasted for part of the day, because that day was a festival for them!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They, too, fasted simply in solidarity with the community.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan once declared that he would fast until he arrived home!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">Answer: He said it only to avoid having to eat with the Nasi.</span><span class="cl"></p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ADVANCE ACCEPTANCE OF FASTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(Shmuel):</span> Any fast that was not formally accepted from the day before is not considered a fast.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he does fast, he is no better than a bellows full of air.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When should he accept it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> At the time of Minchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> During the Minchah prayer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosef):</span> Support for Shmuel can be seen in Megilas Ta'anis which refers to someone being Yeyaser, which presumably means committing himself during prayer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Refutation:</span> It means that he has become forbidden to eat (but not necessarily through Tefilah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Chiya and R. Shimon b. Rebbi argue over whether the phrase says Yeyaser (meaning as explained) or Ye'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to the latter, it is saying that if someone accepted to fast on Monday and Thursday all year, and the festive days of Megilas Ta'anis coincided with one of these, then whichever came first takes precedence.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>EATING BEFORE A FAST</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Before a daytime fast, one may eat:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> Until daybreak.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer bar Shimon):</span> Until the rooster crows.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If he had finished his meal, all agree that he may no longer eat..</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We find that he may eat even after standing after finishing his meal!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">Answer: That is only where the table was not removed from him.</span><span class="cl"></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Alternate version:</span> (Rava) If he slept, all agree that he may no longer eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We find that he may eat even after standing after sleeping!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">Answer: That is where he was only dozing.</span><span class="cl"></p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Question:</span> What is classified as dozing?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ashi):</span> It refers to someone who is half-awake and not fully able to converse.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WEARING SHOES DURING FASTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Kahana citing Rav):</span> An individual who accepted a fast is forbidden to wear leather shoes, in case he undertook a Ta'anis Tzibur (a community fast).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar R. Shiloh):</span> In order to avoid this, he should announce that he is accepting a Ta'anis Yachid (a private fast).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Rabbanan told Rav Sheishes that other Rabbanan wore shoes during a Ta'anis Tzibur.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He angrily replied, 'Perhaps they also eat!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Abaye and Rava would wear shoes without soles.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Mareimar and Mar Zutra would switch their right and left shoes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The Rabbanan of Rav Ashi's Beis Hamedrash wore their shoes as normal, because they held that the only Ta'anis Tzibur in Bavel is Tish'ah b'Av.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>MAKING UP FOR LOST FASTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Rav):</span> A person can eat on a voluntary fast and repay it another day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> He need not repay it, as it is not a Neder; he simply undertook to afflict himself, and if he cannot do it, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Alternate version (Shmuel):</span> Obviously this is true, as it is like a Neder which can be repaid on another day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When R. Yehoshua b. R. Idi was offered steak at R. Asi's house, he declined as he was fasting.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They suggested that he repay the fast another day, in accordance with the aforementioned teaching.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He replied that he was fasting because of a dream that he had the previous night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A fast is as effective for negating a bad dream as fire is for destroying flax.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> It must be done on the next day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosef):</span> This is true even if the next day is Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can he rectify having fasted on Shabbos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He should fast again in repentance for it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> FURTHER SERIES OF FASTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>If the series of fasts beginning on Rosh Chodesh Kislev did not bring rain, Beis Din decree three further fasts on the community.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>People may only eat until nightfall, and are forbidden from Melachah, washing, anointing, wearing leather shoes, and marital relations, and the bath-houses must be locked.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If these fasts did not work, Beis Din decree a further seven fasts on the community, totaling 13.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>These have the extra features that the Shofar is blown and the stores are closed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>On Monday, the doors to the stores would be partially opened before dark, and on Thursday, all day, because of Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If these fasts did not work either, people must decrease business, building, planting, betrothals, weddings, and greetings, like people who have been excommunicated from Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The select individuals would fast until the end of Nisan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If rain fell after Nisan had passed, it is a curse.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">7)</span>FASTS AND <i>ATZERES</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Melachah forbidden - it is pain rather than pleasure!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk compares the day to Shemini Atzeres/ Shavuos, and it is likewise forbidden from Melachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Maybe it should likewise begin from the night before?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk says that the elders should be gathered, which takes place by day; likewise, the Ta'anis is only by day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should then begin at midday, when the elders gather?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This supports R. Huna's view that they would gather in the morning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>During the morning, they would investigate the spiritual affairs of the town; for the first half of the afternoon, they would Leyn the Torah and Haftorah, and for the rest of the afternoon, they would pray for mercy, as we see in a Pasuk that they did these things.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they did the reverse?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We see in another Pasuk that they did it in this order.</p>
