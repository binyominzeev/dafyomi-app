<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> A spontaneous fast is only valid if he fasted all day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Obviously that is a perfectly valid and normal fast!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to a case where after not having eaten in the morning he spontaneously decided to fast all day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> A fast is only valid if it lasts until sunset.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Mishnah says that the men of the Mishmar would fast for only part of the day!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They fast simply in solidarity with the community.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We find that one family of Kohanim, when Tish'ah b'Av was delayed until Sunday, only fasted for part of the day, because that day was a festival for them!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They, too, fasted simply in solidarity with the community.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan once declared that he would fast until he arrived home!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He said it only to avoid having to eat with the Nasi.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ADVANCE ACCEPTANCE OF FASTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Any fast that was not formally accepted from the day before is not considered a fast.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he does fast, he is no better than a bellows full of air.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When should he accept it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> At the time of Minchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> During the Minchah prayer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosef):</span> Support for Shmuel can be seen in Megilas Ta'anis which refers to someone being Yeyaser, which presumably means committing himself during prayer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Refutation:</span> It means that he has become forbidden to eat (but not necessarily through Tefilah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Chiya and R. Shimon b. Rebbi argue over whether the phrase says Yeyaser (meaning as explained) or Ye'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>According to the latter, it is saying that if someone accepted to fast on Monday and Thursday all year, and the festive days of Megilas Ta'anis coincided with one of these, then whichever came first takes precedence.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>EATING BEFORE A FAST</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Before a daytime fast, one may eat:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> Until daybreak.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer bar Shimon):</span> Until the rooster crows.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If he had finished his meal, all agree that he may no longer eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We find that he may eat even after standing after finishing his meal!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only where the table was not removed from him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate version:</span> (Rava) If he slept, all agree that he may no longer eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We find that he may eat even after standing after sleeping!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is where he was only dozing.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is classified as dozing?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ashi):</span> It refers to someone who is half-awake and not fully able to converse.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WEARING SHOES DURING FASTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Kahana citing Rav):</span> An individual who accepted a fast is forbidden to wear leather shoes, in case he undertook a Ta'anis Tzibur (a community fast).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar R. Shiloh):</span> In order to avoid this, he should announce that he is accepting a Ta'anis Yachid (a private fast).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Rabbanan told Rav Sheishes that other Rabbanan wore shoes during a Ta'anis Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He angrily replied, 'Perhaps they also eat!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Abaye and Rava would wear shoes without soles.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Mareimar and Mar Zutra would switch their right and left shoes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The Rabbanan of Rav Ashi's Beis Hamedrash wore their shoes as normal, because they held that the only Ta'anis Tzibur in Bavel is Tish'ah b'Av.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>MAKING UP FOR LOST FASTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Rav):</span> A person can eat on a voluntary fast and repay it another day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> He need not repay it, as it is not a Neder; he simply undertook to afflict himself, and if he cannot do it, it doesn't matter.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate version (Shmuel):</span> Obviously this is true, as it is like a Neder which can be repaid on another day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When R. Yehoshua b. R. Idi was offered steak at R. Asi's house, he declined as he was fasting.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They suggested that he repay the fast another day, in accordance with the aforementioned teaching.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He replied that he was fasting because of a dream that he had the previous night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>A fast is as effective for negating a bad dream as fire is for destroying flax.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> It must be done on the next day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosef):</span> This is true even if the next day is Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can he rectify having fasted on Shabbos?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He should fast again in repentance for it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>MISHNAH: FURTHER SERIES OF FASTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>If the series of fasts beginning on Rosh Chodesh Kislev did not bring rain, Beis Din decree three further fasts on the community.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>People may only eat until nightfall, and are forbidden from Melachah, washing, anointing, wearing leather shoes, and marital relations, and the bath-houses must be locked.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If these fasts did not work, Beis Din decree a further seven fasts on the community, totaling 13.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>These have the extra features that the Shofar is blown and the stores are closed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>On Monday, the doors to the stores would be partially opened before dark, and on Thursday, all day, because of Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If these fasts did not work either, people must decrease business, building, planting, betrothals, weddings, and greetings, like people who have been excommunicated from Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The select individuals would fast until the end of Nisan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If rain fell after Nisan had passed, it is a curse.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>FASTS AND ATZERES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Melachah forbidden - it is pain rather than pleasure!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk compares the day to Shemini Atzeres/ Shavuos, and it is likewise forbidden from Melachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Maybe it should likewise begin from the night before?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk says that the elders should be gathered, which takes place by day; likewise, the Ta'anis is only by day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should then begin at midday, when the elders gather?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This supports R. Huna's view that they would gather in the morning.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>During the morning, they would investigate the spiritual affairs of the town; for the first half of the afternoon, they would Leyn the Torah and Haftorah, and for the rest of the afternoon, they would pray for mercy, as we see in a Pasuk that they did these things.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they did the reverse?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We see in another Pasuk that they did it in this order.</p></div>
