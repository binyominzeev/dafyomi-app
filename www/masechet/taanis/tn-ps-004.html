<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE NATURE OF A TORAH SCHOLAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a young Torah scholar is hot-tempered, it is the Torah which boils within him, as we see from a Pasuk which refers to the Torah as fire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ashi):</span> Any Torah scholar who is not as hard as iron is not a true Torah scholar, as a Pasuk refers to the Torah as a hammer smashing rocks.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> We derive this instead from a Pasuk speaking of the Avneha which are iron - it is not read as Avneha (stones) but Boneha, builders.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> Even so, they should conduct themselves softly, as the Torah tells us to avoid anger.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>INAPPROPRIATE REQUESTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Three people asked for things inappropriately; two were answered appropriately, and one was answered inappropriately:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Eliezer said that he would pick the first girl to give him water - it could have been someone lame or blind, but it turned out to be Rivkah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shaul promised wealth and his daughter to whoever would kill Goliath - it might have been a slave or mamzer, but it turned out to be David.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Yiftach said that he would bring as a Korban whatever would come out  of his house first - it might have been something Tamei, and it turned out to be his daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The prophet bemoans that he did not go to have his oath annuled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A Pasuk speaks of that which Hash-m "did not command, did not speak of, and did not think of."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Did not command" refers to the son of Misha king of Moav, who was brought as a Korban</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Did not speak of" refers to Yiftach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Did not think of" refers to bringing Yitzchak as a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Birchiya):</span> The Jewish People also asked for something inappropriately, and were answered appropriately.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They asked that Hash-m should be as the rain for them, and Hash-m said that since rain is not always desirable, He will be as dew instead.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They also asked that they be as a seal on Hash-m's heart and arm; He said that since these are not always visible, they shall be on His palms instead.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ASKING FOR RAIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that we only ask for rain close to the time of rain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Assuming that asking for rain and mentioning it are the same thing, who does this follow?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It follows R. Yehoshua, who said that we mention the rain from when the Lulav is put away.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Even R. Eliezer could agree to this; asking for rain is different from mentioning it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In some versions, this is phrased as a question that it can only follow R. Yehoshua, and an answer that it could even follow R. Eliezer.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHEN TO STOP ASKING FOR RAIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Yehudah said that on the first day of Pesach, the Shali'ach Tzibur of Shacharis mentions rain, but not that of Musaf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see otherwise in a Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> We ask for rain until Pesach has passed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> We ask for it until the end of Nisan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chisda):</span> Mentioning it stops on the first day of Pesach, but asking for it continues.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Ulla):</span> That is problematic - if we mention rain at times when we cannot ask for it, we should certainly mention it at times when we can!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Alternate answer (Ulla):</span> It is a dispute between Tannaim as to R. Yehudah's opinion; each holds consistently regarding mentioning it and asking for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Alternate answer (R. Yosef):</span>  When R. Yehudah said that we ask for rain until Pesach has passed, he meant until the Shali'ach Tzibur of Shacharis on the first day has concluded.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Surely we do not say the Amidah which contains requests on Yom Tov!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosef):</span> The person delivering the Derashah mentioned the request.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it would be inappropraiate to ask for it at this time!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Ulla's answer must therefore be the correct one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Alternate answer (Rabah):</span> "Until Pesach has passed" means until the time for slaughtering the Korban Pesach has passed (midday on the fourteenth):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just as he begins by mentioning rain (on the last day of Sukos) and not asking for it (until the next day), so too he concludes by mentioning rain (until Musaf of the first day of Pesach) and not asking for it (which ended on the previous morning).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> At the beginning, it makes sense to mention it without asking for it, as mentioning it sets the tone for the future request; but what purpose would it serve at the end?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Ulla's answer must therefore be the correct one.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHEN TO BEGIN MENTIONING RAIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Asi, citing R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah (that on the last day of Sukos, the Shali'ach Tzibur for Musaf mentions rain, but not that of Shacharis).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> We see that we begin asking for rain at a later time:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We begin asking for rain on the third of Cheshvan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Gamliel):</span> We begin on the seventh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The Halachah follows R. Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R Asi):</span> You cannot ask a question from R. Gamliel's view to R. Yochanan's view.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Alternate answer:</span> R. Yochanan was speaking about mentioning it, while R. Gamliel was speaking about asking for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely R. Yochanan said that mentioning rain follows when we ask for it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That referred to <i>stopping</i> them both at the same time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan said that they also begin together!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">New answer:</span> R. Gamliel was referring to Bavel (who still have produce in the fields until the end of Tishrei), while R. Yochanan was referring to Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Just as Bavel has produce in the fields, Eretz Yisrael has pilgrims from Yom Tov, so they should also begin asking for rain later?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan was referring to periods when there is no Beis ha'Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Alternate answer:</span> We can now also resolve the original difficulty by saying that R. Gamliel was referring to Eretz Yisrael at the time of the Beis ha'Mikdash, and R. Yochanan was referring to it when there was no Beis ha'Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>ASKING FOR RAIN NOWADAYS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When should we, who have two days of Safek Yom Tov, begin asking for rain?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> We mention it on the seventh day of Sukos at Musaf, then we do not mention it again until the Musaf of the eighth day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Shmuel):</span> After mentioning it on the seventh day at Musaf, thereby showing it to be Yom Tov, how can we then revoke that by not mentioning it at Minchah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> We mention it at Musaf and Minchah on the seventh day, then we do not mention it again until Musaf of the eighth day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava and R. Sheshes):</span> Once we have started mentioning it, we do not stop.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rav also came around to this view, as he said that one counts twenty-one days from Rosh Hashanah until the seventh day of Sukos and then begins to mention it, and once one has started, one doesn't stop.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Halachah is that once we have started mentioning it, we do not stop.</p>
