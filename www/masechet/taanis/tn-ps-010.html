<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ERETZ YISRAEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Eretz Yisrael was created first, and then all the world.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Hash-m waters Eretz Yisrael directly, and the rest of the world through an intermediary.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Eretz Yisrael drinks rainwater and the rest of the world takes a remnant.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Eretz Yisrael drinks first, and then the rest of the world.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is like a man kneading cheese; he takes the edible part, and discards the waste.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE SOURCE OF RAIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Eliezer said that the seawater is sweetened in the clouds - how does he know this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He merges two words in two Pesukim about rain to read that it is "prepared" in the clouds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yehoshua do with these Pesukim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from them that light clouds contain little water, whereas dark clouds contain much water.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The Beraisa about the Pasuk teaching us that the upper waters are suspended with the word of Hash-m and bear the fruit of rain follows R. Yehoshua.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Eliezer counters that that Pasuk refers to the fruit of Hash-m's labors.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua b. Levi):</span> The entire world drinks from a remnant of  the waters of Gan Eden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>From the remnant of a container that waters a Beis Kor, one can water a Tarkav - one-sixtieth.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>RELATIVE MEASURES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Mitzrayim measures 400 by 400 Parsah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>It is a sixtieth of Kush, which is a sixtieth of the world, which is a sixtieth of Gan, which is a sixtieth of Eden, which is a sixtieth of Gehinom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Thus, the whole world is like a pot-cover for Gehinom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Some say that Gehinom has no measurement.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Some say that Eden has no measurement.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Oshiya):</span> A Pasuk alludes to Bavel having abundant grain because it is situated on ample waters.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Bavel is wealthy in that it need not rely on rainwater for its produce.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> It is shady and moist, not dry.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MISHNAH: ASKING FOR RAIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> We begin to ask for rain on the third of Cheshvan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Raban Gamliel):</span> We begin on the seventh, fifteen days after Sukos, so that the last pilgrim can reach the Euphrates.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>ASKING FOR RAIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The Halachah follows Raban Gamliel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chananyah):</span> In Bavel, they only begin to ask for rain sixty days into the season.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Huna bar Chiya citing Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows Chananyah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely Shmuel said that we ask for rain from when firewood is brought into the house of Tabus the bird-trapper?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps they are both the same date.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is the sixtieth day counted with the preceding period, or is it part of the ensuing period (and we ask for rain on it)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav said it is past of the ensuing period, Shmuel said it is part of the preceding period.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Siman for this is that Rav, who lives in the high ground of Eretz Yisrael, requires more water, and therefore begins asking for rain earlier; Shmuel lives in the lower ground of Bavel and needs less.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> The Halachah is that the sixtieth day is part of the ensuing period.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>MISHNAH: FASTING FOR RAIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>If no rain had fallen by the seventeenth of Cheshvan, select individuals would fast three fasts.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>With these fasts, they would eat and drink at nightfall.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They were permitted to perform Melachah, wash, anoint themselves, wear leather shoes, and engage in marital relations.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If no rain had arrived by Rosh Chodesh Kislev, Beis Din would decree three fasts upon the community.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>With these fasts, they would eat and drink at nightfall.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They were permitted to perform Melachah, wash, anoint themselves, wear leather shoes, and engage in marital relations.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>THE FAST OF THE INDIVIDUALS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who are the "select individuals"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Huna):</span> The Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Huna):</span> The three fasts of these individuals are on Monday, Thursday and Monday.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already know that fasts may not begin on Thursday, because of its effect on prices!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that that only applies to community fasts, but not to individuals fasting.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>A Beraisa likewise states that the individuals would fast on Monday, Thursday, and Monday, breaking for Rosh Chodesh and the festive days listed in Megilas Ta'anis.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>CLASSIFYING PEOPLE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A person should not say that he is only a Talmid and unworthy to be one of the individuals who fasts; all Talmidei Chachamim fall into this category.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Who qualifies as one of these individuals - someone who is worthy of being appointed as head of the community.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Who qualifies as a Talmid - someone who can reply to any question, even one from Maseches Kalah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) (R. Meir):</span> Not everyone can be one of these individuals or a Talmid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> Anyone can be one of these individuals, and is remembered for the good; it is not good for him, but painful.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) (R. Shimon b. Elazar):</span> Not everyone can be one of these individuals or a Talmid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon b. Gamliel):</span> Anyone can be one of these individuals, and is remembered for the good; it is not good for him, but painful.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>CHANGES IN THE SITUATION REGARDING FASTING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If someone was fasting on account of troubles and it passed, or an account of a sick person and they became healed, he should complete his fast.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If someone travels to a place where they are fasting, he should join their fast.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he travels from a place where they are fasting to a place where they are not fasting, he should complete his fast.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If (in case a1) he forgetfully ate and drank, he should not be seen to do so in public, and he should not indulge.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We find this with Yaakov, when he told his sons not to appear satisfied before Eisav and Yishmael.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">10)</span><p>TRAVEL TIPS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Yosef told his brothers not to get too involved in a point of Halachah whilst journeying in case they would lose their way.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely R. Ela'i said that two Talmidei Chachamim who do not converse in Torah during their journey deserve to be burned?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They must review their studies, but they must not become engrossed in analyzing them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This Pasuk was elsewhere explained to mean that one should not take big strides, which take away one-five hundredth of a person's vision.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Yosef also told them to enter the city during daylight.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Rav):</span> A person should always leave and enter a city during daylight.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing R. Chiya):</span> A traveler should not eat more than he would eat during years of famine.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In Bavel, they gave the reason as being so as to avoid stomach sickness.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In Eretz Yisrael, they gave the reason as being so as to save his food.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>A practical difference would be in the case of a person travelling in a ship, where there is only the latter concern.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>An alternate difference would be in the case of a person travelling from village to village, where there is only the former concern.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>R. Papa would eat some bread every Parsah; he held that the only concern was sickness, which he would not suffer from (being generously built).</p></div>
