<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE STORY OF NAKDIMON (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Nakdimon prayed that he had taken the water only to benefit the pilgrims, and the rain promptly fell.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>When Nakdimon asked for the surplus water to be returned, the 	Roman replied that it was too late anyway, as it was after sunset.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Nakdimon prayed again, and the sun came out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Nakdimon was really Buni; he was so called because the sun shone for him (Nikdarah Chama).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN THE SUN STOOD STILL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Three people merited that the sun changed its course for them - Moshe, Yehoshua, and Nakdimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Nakdimon is as we have said, Yehoshua is learned from a Pasuk, but how do we know that it happened with Moshe?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> It is learned from Yehoshua by way of a Gezeirah Shavah with the word Achel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> The Gezeirah Shavah is with the word Tes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> The Pasuk says that the nations trembled, which refers to the sun stopping for Moshe.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CURSES AND BLESSINGS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Pasuk which speaks of one city receiving rain, and another not, means both as a curse; the one receiving rain receives too much.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Pasuk referring to Jerusalem as a Nidah is a blessing; just as a Nidah is eventually permitted, so too does Jerusalem eventually regain its status.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Pasuk says that Jerusalem is like a widow; only <i>like</i> a widow, but not actually as a widow; as a woman whose husband is overseas but will return.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>It speaks of Hash-m making the Jews despised, which is a blessing in that they will not be appointed as tax-collectors or oppressive officers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The Pasuk which says that Hash-m shall smite Israel as a reed in the water is a blessing:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Achiya ha'Shiloni's curse is better than Bil'am's blessing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Achiya cursed Israel as a reed, which stands in the water, renews its stem, has many roots, and sways with the wind.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Bil'am blessed Israel as a cedar, which does not stand in the water, does not renew its stem, does not have many roots, and breaks in the southerly wind.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Furthermore, the reed merits that it is used as a quill for writing a Torah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>AS SOFT AS A REED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A person should always be as soft as a reed rather than as stiff (haughty) as a cedar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Elazar b. R. Shimon was once riding and feeling proud of himself for having learned much Torah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">20b----------------------------------------20b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He happened across an ugly person, who greeted him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Elazar responded by saying, "Good-for-nothing! Is everyone in your town as ugly as you?"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The man responded, "I do not know; why do you not ask the Craftsman Who made me?"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Contrite, R. Elazar bowed and begged forgiveness, but the man wouldn't be swayed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Elazar followed the man to his town, whereupon his townsfolk came out and greeted R. Elazar as a rabbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>The man said that if R. Elazar is a rabbi, there should not be too many other such people.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>The townsfolk urged him to forgive R. Elazar, which he did on the condition that he should not make a habit of such an attitude.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>R. Elazar promptly expounded that a person should always be as easygoing as a reed rather than as stiff (haughty) as a cedar, and therefore the reed merits that it is used as a quill for writing a Torah, tefillin and mezuzos.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>COLLAPSING BUILDINGS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that a city which suffered pestilence or collapsing buildings sounds the Shofar and fasts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This refers to buildings which were sound but not to those which are shaky; it refers to those which were not due to collapse, but not to those which were bound to collapse.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Aren't sound buildings and building which are not due to collapse the same thing?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Buildings that are too tall might be sound but are bound to collapse.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Buildings that are situated on riverbanks might be sound but are bound to collapse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>There was a ruinous wall in Neharda'a which Rav and Shmuel would not pass beneath, even though it had been standing for thirteen years.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When Rav Ada bar Ahava passed that way, Rav told Shmuel that it was safe, as his merit would protect them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Huna made use of R. Ada b. Ahava's merit to retrieve his wine from a ruined building.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Ada b. Ahava was angry; he held that a person should not rely on a miracle, and even if one transpires, it detracts from his merits.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Pasuk speaks of Yaakov's merits having decreased due to the miracles that Hash-m did for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Ada b. Ahava's merit was that, as he said when asked about his longevity, that he never grew angry at home, walked in front of a greater person, thought about Torah in unclean places, walked four Amos without Torah or Tefillin, slept or napped in a Beis ha'Midrash, rejoiced in another's downfall, or called someone by a derogatory nickname (according to others - called someone by a family nickname).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>THE GOOD DEEDS OF RAV HUNA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rava asked Rafram bar Papa about R. Huna's good deeds of his youth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He replied that on a cloudy day, R. Huna would ride around town in a golden carriage, and demolish all the dangerous walls. If the owner could not afford to rebuild it, he would pay for it himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Every Friday he would send people to buy all the leftover vegetables from the market and throw them into the river.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did not he give the vegetables to the poor?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As then they would rely on him for their vegetables, which would be disastrous if he had none.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did not he give them to animals?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As he held that one is not permitted to give food that is fit for humans to animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Qustion:</span> Why did he buy them at all?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> So that they would not be discouraged from bringing vegetables for Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>When he had a medical problem, he would place a bottle of water at the gate for anyone to take.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some say he did this to avoid their being harmed by Shivsa, the demon who attacks anyone who eats without washing his hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>When he ate bread, he would open his door wide and invite anyone who wished to come and join him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> I could emulate all his deeds except that one, as there are too many poor people in my town.</p>
