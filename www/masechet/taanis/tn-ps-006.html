<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>YOREH AND MALKOSH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>"Yoreh" (the early rains) are so called because they teach (Moreh) people to prepare for winter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Alternatively, they saturate (Marveh) the land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Alternatively, they descend gently (like gentle teachings).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Yoreh is harmful?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Just as Malkosh (the late rains, mentioned adjacently) are beneficial, so is Yoreh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Malkosh is harmful?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Just as Yoreh is beneficial, so is Malkosh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But how do we know that Yoreh is beneficial?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Pasuk states that Hash-m will give Moreh as Tzedakah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE TIMES FOR <i>YOREH </i>AND <i>MALKOSH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Yoreh falls in Cheshvan and Malkosh in Nisan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Yoreh falls in Tishrei and Malkosh in Iyar?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk states that Hash-m will give it "in its proper time."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>"Malkosh" is so called because, in the nation's desperation for it, it crushes their stubbornness (Mol Kashyuseihen).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Alternate explanation:</span> It causes the grain to fill out (Memalei) in its stalks (Kasheha).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Alternate explanation:</span> It descends on the ears (Melilos) and stalks (Kashin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Yoreh falls in Cheshvan and Malkosh in Nisan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Yoreh falls in Kislev?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Just as the Pasuk says that Malkosh will fall in its proper time, so will Yoreh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (R. Meir) Yoreh is in Cheshvan and Malkosh in Nisan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> Yoreh is in Kislev.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who are these Chachamim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Yosi, as seen in the Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The correct time for the first rainfall:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> The first part falls on the third of Cheshvan, the middle part on the seventh, and the last part on the seventeenth.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> The first part falls on the seventh, the middle part on the seventeenth, and the last part on the twenty-third.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> The first part falls in the seventeenth, the middle part on the twenty-third, and the last part on the first of Kislev.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Similarly, R. Yosi ruled that those who fast in the absence of rain do not do so until Rosh Chodesh Kislev.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Ameimar understood R. Chisda to have said as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We ask for rain on the third of Cheshvan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Gamliel):</span> On the seventh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> The Halachah follows R. Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DIFFERENT RAINFALLS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to whose opinion is the following Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon b. Gamliel):</span> Rain that fell for seven consecutive days counts as the first, second and third rainfalls.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It follows R. Yosi (who holds that there is a seven-day gap between each rainfall).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need to know the time for the first rainfall, so that we can begin asking for it, and the time for the third rainfall, so that we know when to begin fasting if there has been no rain; but why do we need to know the time for the second rainfall?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> For the purposes of Nedarim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Someone who makes a vow until the rains, is bound until the second rainfall.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> For olives</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A person is allowed to take his Leket, Shikchah and Peyah once the "Nemushos" have been;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He may take his Peret and Olelos once the poor people have been;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He may take his olives after the second rainfall.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are "Nemushos"?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Old men on staffs.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Alternate answer (Reish Lakish):</span> Those who collect after others have already collected.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> To take short cuts through the fields of others, which can be done until the second rainfall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> To remove produce of Shemitah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may use and burn straw of Shemitah until the second rainfall.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The reason is that the Pasuk says that you can use it as long as there is produce still in the fields.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>TYPES OF RAIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rainfall is called Reviyah because it fertilizes (Rova) the land:</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> The rain is the husband of the land, as we see in a Pasuk referring to the land giving birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> The first rainfall penetrates one Tefach into the ground, the second makes the soil suitable for sealing a cask.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> Rain that fell to this degree has not been subjected to the punishment of stopping up the Heavens.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rain that fell earlier in the day than that punishment is read aloud (in Shema) shows that it is not subject to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This is only true if it fell before the evening Shema, but not if it fell before the morning Shema:</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The morning clouds are worthless, as seen in a Pasuk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely a folk saying has it that rain in the morning means rain all day!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only when it pours down from a heavy cloud.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>UNDESIRED RAIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> It is a good year if Teves is a widow (i.e. rainless).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Some say:</span> Because the roads to the schools will not become pot-holed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Others say:</span> Because the crops will not be subject to blast.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely R. Chisda said that it is a good year if Teves is slushy?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That referred to where no rain fell previously.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> Rain that fell on part of the country has not been subjected to the punishment of stopping up the Heavens.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely a Pasuk about rain falling on one town but not on another was explained to be a curse for both?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That referred to where the town received excessive rain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This is also seen from the wording of the Pasuk.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>THE BLESSING UPON RAIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> We bless on the rain from when the Chasan goes to meet the Kalah (the raindrops hit the rebounding raindrops).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Berachah do we say?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah citing Rav):</span> "We thank you, Hash-m our G-d, for each drop that You cause to descend."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Conclude: "If our mouths were as full of song..." until "Blessed is the One of Rov ("many" or "most") acknowledgments."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Only "most" and not all?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Say, "G-d of acknowledgments."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> Say both.</p>
