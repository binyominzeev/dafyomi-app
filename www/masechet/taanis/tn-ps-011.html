<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CONDUCT DURING FAMINE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Rav):</span> Anyone who deprives himself of food in years of famine is saved from unusual forms of death, as alluded to in a Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Resh Lakish):</span> It is forbidden to engage in marital relations during years of famine, as we see that Yosef only had children before the famine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Childless people may engage in marital relations during famine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the community is in distress, and someone separates himself from them, his two escorting Malachim place their hands on his head and say that he will not live to see the salvation of the community.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When the community is in distress, a person should not say that he will go home, eat and enjoy his security.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Concerning such people, who say "eat and drink for tomorrow we die," the Pasuk says that their sin is only cleansed through death.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Such happens to people who at least acknowledge that they will die; but with wicked people who do not even admit to that, the Pasuk says that even Tzadikim will die.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rather, a person should afflict himself in sympathy with the troubles of the community.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>We find this with Moshe, who sat on a stone rather than on a chair, to show empathy with the plight of the Bnei Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Anyone who afflicts himself along with the community merits seeing the salvation of the community.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>A person need not be concerned about someone to testify about his doing so, as the Pasuk says that even his walls and ceiling-beams will testify.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(D'bei R. Shila):</span> His two escorting Malachim testify for him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chidka):</span> His Neshamah testifies for him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Others say):</span> His limbs testify for him.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>REWARD AND PUNISHMENT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Pasuk of "the G-d of integrity" means that just as Hash-m exacts retribution from Resha'im in the next world even for minor sins, He exacts retribution from Tzadikim in this world for minor sins.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>"Without injustice" means that just as He rewards Tzadikim in the next world even for minor mitzvos, He also rewards Resha'im in this world for minor mitzvos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>"He is righteous and just" means that when a person dies, a complete account of his deeds is listed to him, and he admits to them, signs to them, and accepts the justice of the verdict.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE VALUE OF FASTING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Anyone who fasts is called a sinner.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>He holds like the Tana of the following Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar ha'Kafar citing Rebbi):</span> The Pasuk refers to the Nazir as having sinned, because he deprived himself from wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he is called a sinner just for abstaining from wine, how much more so someone who abstains from all food.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The Pasuk calls him "holy."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he is called holy just for abstaining from wine, how much more so someone who abstains from all food.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Shmuel account for the Pasuk calling him holy?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to his hair being forbidden for benefit.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Elazar account for the Pasuk saying that he has sinned?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to a Nazir who became Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely R. Elazar said that a person should treat his insides as holy and not deprive them of anything!?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was referring to a person who finds fasting overly difficult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Resh Lakish):</span> Such a person is considered a Chasid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Sheshes):</span> A Talmid Chacham who fasts might as well be doing so because a dog ate his food.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah bar Aba):</span> The extra restrictions of community fasts only apply in Bavel to Tish'ah b'Av.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Citing Resh Lakish):</span> A Talmid Chacham may not fast, as it detracts from his studies.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SPONTANEOUS FASTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ze'ira citing R. Huna):</span> If an individual accepts a fast, even if he ate and drank all night, he says Aneinu the next day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he slept through the next night without eating, he does not say Aneinu on the next day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yosef):</span> Does R. Huna hold that a spontaneous fast is invalid, or does he hold that a spontaneous fast is valid, but Aneinu is not said for it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> He holds that a spontaneous fast is valid and one <i>does</i> recite Aneinu for it; the difference here is that the fast was not declared in advance.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Mar Ukva was unable to answer the following questions in Ginzak:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Is a spontaneous fast valid?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Is a jug that has been used to store wine of non-Jews forbidden for usage?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Which garments did Moshe wear while performing the initiation of the Mishkan?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>At the Beis ha'Midrash, he was answered:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A spontaneous fast is valid, and one says Aneinu.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The jug is permitted for use after twelve months.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Moshe wore a white linen robe.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Kahana):</span> He wore a white linen robe without a hem (to remove suspicion of theft).</p></div>
