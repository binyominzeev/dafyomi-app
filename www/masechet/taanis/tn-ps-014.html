<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHERE TO SAY <i>ANEINU</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support for objection (R. Ashi):</span> We see that the second and third series of fasts were identical in having twenty-four Berachos from the Mishnah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah states that the last series were different to the previous series in that the Shofar was blown and the stores were locked.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The implication is that they were identical in all other aspects.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggested objection:</span> Other differences were left out.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Refutation:</span> It says that "these were the [only] differences"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> But we know that the difference of the Aron being placed in the street was left out!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Refutation:</span> It was not left out; it was mentioned in the other Perek.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, we can also say that there is a difference in the number of Berachos, and it was not mentioned as it is mentioned in the other Perek.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In conclusion, where does one say Aneinu?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1:</span> Between the Berachos of Ge'ulah and Refuah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2:</span> In the Berachah of Shome'a Tefilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The Halachah is that it is said in the Berachah of Shome'a Tefilah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PREGNANT AND NURSING MOTHERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Tana #1:</span> Pregnant and nursing mothers fast in the first set of fasts, but not in the last set.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Tana #2:</span> They fast in the last set of fasts, but not in the first set.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Tana #3:</span> They do not fast in the first or last set of fasts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ashi):</span> If we explain that they fasted in the middle set of fasts, we can reconcile all these statements.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SHOFAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah states that the last series were different to the previous series in that they were Masri'in and the stores were locked.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> Masri'in means that the Shofar was blown.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah b. R. Shmuel bar Shilas citing Rav):</span> It means that they would cry out with Aneinu.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The presumption is that each does not hold of the other's view.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see in a Beraisa that in the last set of seven fasts, there were a total of eighteen Hasra'os, and Yericho is the Siman - and Yericho was conquered with Shofaros!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All agree that Masri'in refers to Shofar; the dispute is whether it also refers to Aneinu.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see in a Beraisa that Masri'in only refers to Shofar:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For other plagues, such as skin disease, locusts, flies, hornets, mosquitoes, snake and scorpion infestations, they were not Masri'in, only cry out in prayer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a dispute between Tana'im:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> On Shabbos, we are Masri'in for besieged or flooded cities and storm-tossed ships.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> We do so to call aid, but not in prayer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It cannot be referring to Shofar, as that is forbidden on Shabbos; it must refer to Aneinu, and we see it is referred to with Masri'in.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ADDING MORE FASTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>In the days of R. Yehudah Nesiah, thirteen fasts were decreed, which were not answered, so he considered decreeing more.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Ami told him not to overburden the community.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Aba claimed that R. Ami only said this to avoid fasting himself; rather, for any troubles other than rain, we fast until we are answered.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Likewise, a Beraisa states that the sequence of fasts was only said for rain, but for other troubles, we fast until we are answered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Doesn't this contradict R. Ami?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a dispute between Tana'im:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> We do not impose more than thirteen fasts on the community, so as not to overburden them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon b. Gamliel):</span> The reason is that the time for rainfall has passed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>PLACES WITH SPECIAL NEEDS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">The Bnei Ninveh asked Rebbi:</span> "We who need rain even in midsummer, should we pray for rain like individuals, in Shome'a Tefilah, or as a community, in Birchas ha'Shanim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He replied that they should pray like individuals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see otherwise in a Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The given order of fasts applies to an era when the seasons function as normal and Yisrael are in their land, but nowadays, it changes according to the needs of the year and the location.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You cannot challenge Rebbi with a Beraisa; he is a Tana and he can argue with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In conclusion, where should they ask for rain?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Nachman):</span> In Birchas ha'Shanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Sheshes):</span> In the Berachah of Shome'a Tefilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The Halachah is that they should say it in Shome'a Tefilah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>CLOSING THE STORES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that on Monday, the doors to the stores would be partially opened before dark, and on Thursday, all day, because of Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does this mean that on Thursday they would be partially open all day, or fully open all day?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We see the latter in a Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On Monday, the doors to the stores would be partially opened before dark, and on Thursday, they would be fully open all day, because of Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>On Monday, if he had two doors, one should be open and the other closed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he had chairs blocking the view of his door, it can be left open.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">7)</span>BUILDING AND PLANTING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that if these fasts did not work either, people must decrease business, building, planting...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Building and planting refers to buildings and plantings for pleasure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Building for pleasure refers to building a house for one's son who is about to marry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Planting for pleasure refers to planting a tree in honor of the king's new son.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">8)</span>GREETING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah also forbade greeting people in these circumstances.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Talmidei Chachamim may not greet each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If greeted by an Am ha'Aretz, one should reply in a low voice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>They should dress and sit as mourners, as excommunicated people, despised by Hash-m, until He has mercy upon them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> An important person may not prostrate himself in prayer unless he is as certain as Yeshoshua to be answered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>An important person may not wear sackcloth unless he is as certain as Yehoram ben Achav to be answered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Not everyone is answered by rending their clothes, and not everyone is answered through falling down.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Moshe and Aharon were answered by falling on their faces.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Yehoshua and Kalev were answered by rending their clothes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Since it says "<i>And</i> Yehoshua", it means that he did both.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Not everyone is answered by bowing down, and not everyone is answered by prostrating themselves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Kings are answered by bowing down.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Princes are answered by prostrating themselves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Since it says "Princes <i>and</i> they shall prostrate themselves", it means that they did both.</p>
