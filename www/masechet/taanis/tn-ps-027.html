<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE NUMBER OF <i>MISHMAROS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that the function of Ma'amados is that the Torah tells everyone to bring Korbanos, but they cannot be brought in the absence of their owners.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Nevi'im therefore decreed that there be twenty-four Mishmaros of Kohanim, paralleled by twenty-four Ma'amados of Kohanim, Levi'im and Yisraelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There were twenty-four Mishmaros in Eretz Yisrael and twelve in Yericho.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That totals thirty-six, twelve too many!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that twelve of the twenty-four were in Yericho.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Each Mishmar, when its turn came, would split up; half went to Yerushalayim, and half went to Yericho to arrange food and water for them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> Kohanim, Levi'im and Yisraelim must be present in Yerushalayim for the Korban to be valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R Shimon b. Elazar):</span> Kohanim, Levi'im and musical instruments must be present.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The dispute revolves around whether it is voices or instruments which are essential for song.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chama bar Guria citing Rav):</span> Moshe established eight Mishmaros, four from Elazar and four from Isamar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shmuel expanded them to sixteen, and David expanded them to twenty-four.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa states that David and Shmuel jointly expanded them to twenty-four!?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that from Shmuel's expansion to sixteen, David enlarged it to twenty-four.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Moshe established sixteen Mishmaros, eight from Elazar and eight from Isamar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When Elazar's desendants became more numerous, he divided them into twenty-four.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Pasuk states that he divided Elazar's descendants into sixteen Mishmaros.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Another Pasuk states that Elazar doubled and Isamar remained the same.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The second Pasuk is brought in case one thought that Isamara had also doubled in size.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This Beraisa contradicts R. Chama bar Guria!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Machlokes Tana'im, and R. Chama bar Guria holds like the Tana who says that Moshe made eight Mishmaros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Four Mishmaros returned from Bavel, and the Nevi'im divided them into twenty-four.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">27b----------------------------------------27b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>They then mixed lots for the twenty-four, and the four drew six each.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Even if Yehoyariv (the first of the Mishmaros) would have arrived from Bavel after that, they would have had to wait until after the entire group of Yedayah had served.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>KORBANOS </i>KEEP THE WORLD GOING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah said that the Yisraelim would gather and read from Ma'ase Bereishis - how do we know this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Were it not for the Ma'amados, the world could not exist.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Avraham asked Hash-m how he could be sure that his descendants would inherit the land - perhaps they would sin and be eradicated.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Hash-m told him to perform the Bris Bein ha'B'sarim i.e. Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>When Avraham asked what would be when there is no Beis ha'Mikdash, Hash-m said that reciting the order of Korbanos would be considered as bringing them and would earn forgiveness.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE PRAYERS OF THE <i>MA'AMAD</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The men of the Mishmar would pray that the Korbanos should be accepted in good will.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The men of the Ma'amad would go to Shul and fast four times:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On Monday, for those sailing in boats;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>On Tuesday, for those travelling in the wilderness;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>On Wednesday, that children should not contract croup;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>On Thursday, that pregnant women should not miscarry and nursing mothers should be able to nurse.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>On Friday, they would not fast, out of respect for Shabbos; and all the more so on Shabbos itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did not they fast on Sunday?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> Because it is a Christian holiday.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 ( R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> Because it is the third day from man's creation (when he is weak).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Resh Lakish):</span> Because the extra Neshamah which was given to man on Evev Shabbos has been removed, and he is weak.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE TORAH PORTIONS READ DURING THE <i>MA'AMAD</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that on Sunday they would read from Bereishis and Yehi Rakiya.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Bereishis would be read by two people, Yehi Rakiya by one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Yehi Rakiya was read by one as it is only three Pesukim; but how could Bereishis be read by two - it is only five Pesukim, and each must read at least three?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> The second person repeats the third Pasuk of the first person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> The third Pasuk is split into two.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did not Rav say like Shmuel?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He held that we cannot divide a Pasuk that Moshe did not divide.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could Shmuel say that we split it up; R. Chanina with great difficulty received permission to do so only with schoolchildren?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel would hold that just as permission was given in that case because there was no other solution, here too there is no other solution and permission would be given.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't Shmuel hold that the second person repeats the third Pasuk of the first person?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is forbidden, in order to prevent problems of latecomers thinking that the first person only read two Pesukim, or early leavers thinking that the second person will only read two Pesukim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We find in a Beraisa that neither Rav nor Shmuel's suggestion is given:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(During a regular reading):</span> a section of six Pesukim is read by two people, a section of five by one.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one person read three Pesukim of the five-Pasuk section, the second reads the last two Pesukim plus one Pasuk of the next section.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Some say they he should read three Pesukim of the next section, as no less than three Pesukim should be read from any section.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Other solutions were given in that case because it was possible to read also from the following section.</p>
