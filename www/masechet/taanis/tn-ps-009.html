<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>R. YOCHANAN AND RESH LAKISH'S SON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The Pasuk of "Aser t'Aser" teaches us to give Ma'aser so that we should grow wealthy (Ashir).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan asked Reish Lakish's son to tell him the Pasuk that he had just learned, and he replied with this Pasuk.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He asked R. Yochanan to explain it, and he gave this explanation.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>When asked to explain how he knew it, R. Yochanan told him to test Hash-m on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The boy challenged him with a Pasuk that we may not test Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Yochanan cited R. Hoshaya that this case is an exception, as seen in a Pasuk.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>The boy replied that had he reached that Pasuk, he wouldn't have needed R. Yochanan and R. Hoshaya's explanation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yochanan found Reish Lakish's son saying a Pasuk from Mishlei about a person sinning, coming to harm, and not acknowledging why it happened.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan mused that there must be a Pasuk in Chumash alluding to this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reish Lakish's son replied that the episode of Yosef's brothers in Egypt alludes to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yochanan lifted up his eyelids to look at the intelligent boy, whereupon his mother took him away, so that R. Yochanan's look should not kill him as it did his father.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE MERIT THAT BRINGS RAIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Rain falls in the merit of an individual, but general sustenance only comes in the merit of many.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see that general sustenance comes in the merit of an individual:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(R. Yosi b. R. Yehudah) Israel had three good providers: Moshe, in whose benefit there was Man, Aharon, in whose benefit were the Clouds of Glory, and Miriam, in whose benefit there was the well.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When Miriam died, the well disappeared, but it returned in the merit of Moshe and Aharon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>When Aharon died, the Clouds of Glory disappeared.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Canaan heard that Aharon had died and the Clouds of Glory had disappeared, and presumed that he now had a right to fight Israel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Likewise, the Pasuk about Israel seeing that Aharon died can also be read as them being exposed <i>because</i> Aharon died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>This follows Reish Lakish's teaching that "Ki" can mean if, perhaps, rather, and because.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>The Clouds of Glory and the well returned in the merit of Moshe.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>When Moshe died, they all disappeared, as we see from a Pasuk speaking about three shepherds being cut off in a single month.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Moshe is different because he was requesting these things on behalf of many people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>When Rava died, his students went to R. Papa. They would signal to each other when he said something that they disagreed with.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">9b----------------------------------------9b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He was disheartened and dreamt of the Pasuk of three shepherds being cut off.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The next day, he told them to go in peace, so that the dream would be harmlessly fulfilled through the farewell greeting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Shimi bar Ashi would ask R. Papa many questions. One day he saw him lying down and praying to be saved from the shame he was causing him, so he kept silent from then on.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Reish Lakish also held that rain falls in the merit of an individual, even if he only needs it for a single field or even a single plant, as learned from a Pasuk.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An example is R. Daniel bar Katina, who would tour his garden daily and say which rows required water, and it would rain on those rows.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Pasuk says that "Hash-m makes Chazizim" - what does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that Hash-m makes a separate Chaziz for each Tzadik.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are Chazizim?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Porchos.; they signify approaching rain.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are Porchos?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Light clouds beneath thick clouds.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Fine rain before regular rain means that the rains will last a long time; fine rain after regular rain means that the rains will stop.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Siman for the former is a sieve; the Siman for the latter is goat dung.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Ula went to Bavel and saw Porchos clouds; he warned people to clear away their goods, but it did not rain.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He noted that just as Babylonians lie, so do their clouds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Ula went to Bavel and saw a basket of dates for a zuz; he wondered why people were not studying Torah if food was so cheap.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But when he suffered ill effects from eating them, he wondered that they were able to study at all, considering the ill effects of abundant food.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE <i>BERAISA</i> ABOUT THE SOURCE OF RAIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> The world drinks from the ocean, as we see from the Pasuk that "a mist went up and watered the ground."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yehoshua):</span> Surely seawater is salty?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is sweetened in the clouds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> The world drinks from the Upper Waters, as we see from the Pasuk that it "drinks from the water of the Heavens."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Pasuk about a mist going up refers to the clouds rising and accepting water from above</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They then rain on the ground, a hairsbreadth between each drop.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This teaches that the day of rainfall is as great as the day that the Heavens and Earth were created (as per Daf 2a).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Pasuk of "He waters the mountains from His upper chambers," explained to refer to the chambers of Hash-m, goes according to R. Yehoshua.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer would counter that when the water rises up there, it is referred to as the upper chambers.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We see that such an explanation exists from the Pasuk about dust and ashes falling from the Heavens.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Pasuk of Hash-m filling the storehouses with the depths goes according to R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehoshua would counter that that is referring to the creation of the world.</p>
