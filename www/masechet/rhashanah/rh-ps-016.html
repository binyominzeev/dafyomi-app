<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE FOUR JUDGMENTS OF THE YEAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>On Pesach, judgment is passed concerning produce.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>On Shavuos, judgment is passed concerning fruit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>On Rosh Hashanah, all the world passes like Bnei Maron for Judgment.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>On Sukos, judgment is passed concerning water.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE JUDGMENT OF PRODUCE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which produce is being judged?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The produce presently in the fields.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When was judgment passed for the things that happened to it until now?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to the produce that is due to be sown.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that one judgment is passed for each crop, but we see otherwise in a Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If calamity befalls a crop before Pesach, it was decided in the previous year.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it happens after Pesach, it was decided this year.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If calamity befalls a person before Yom Kipur, it was decided in the previous year.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If it happens after Yom Kipur, it was decided this year.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Two judgments are passed on each crop.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abayey):</span> Therefore, if a person sees his slow crops doing well, he should quickly plant some fast-growing crops (as it is a year of a good verdict).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE AUTHORSHIP OF THE MISHNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who does the Mishnah follow?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Gemara cites four opinions in a Beraisa that differ from the Mishnah:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>(R. Meir) Everything is judged on Rosh Hashanah and the verdicts are sealed on Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> Everything is judged on Rosh Hashanah and the verdicts are sealed on different dates; Pesach for produce, Shavuos for fruit, Sukos for water and Yom Kipur for man.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> Man is judged every day, as derived from a Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nosson):</span> Man is judged every moment, as derived from Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah follows R. Yehudah and is referring to the verdicts.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah sets the date for man as Rosh Hashanah (not Yom Kipur)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Mishnah refers to the beginning of the judgment process and follows Tana d'Bei R. Yishmael:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>On Pesach, judgment is passed concerning produce.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>On Shavuos, judgment is passed concerning fruit.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>On Sukos, judgment is passed concerning water.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Man is judged on Rosh Hashanah and his verdict is sealed on Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE JUDGMENT OF MAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Chisda):</span> What is the reason of R. Yosi (that man is judged every day)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He gave a Pasuk as his reason!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he say the same as R. Nosson?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Nosson's Pasuk is only referring to Hash-m studying man.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The same could be said for R. Yosi's Pasuk!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chisda):</span> R. Yosi's source is a Pasuk that speaks of daily judgment.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This Pasuk also teaches us that a king is judged before his people.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The reason is that it is improper for him to have to wait in line.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Alternately, the reason is that he should be judged before the Judge grows angry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosef):</span> Our daily prayer for the sick is in accordance with R. Yosi's view that man is judged daily.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Alternately, it follows the Rabanan, in accordance with R. Yitzchak's view that prayer helps even after a verdict has been passed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing R. Akiva):</span> The Omer is brought on Pesach to influence the judgment for the crops which takes place at that time.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Two Loaves are brought on Shavuos to influence the judgment for fruit which takes place at that time.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The water-libation takes place on Sukos to influence the judgment for rains which takes place at that time.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>On Rosh Hashanah we say Malchuyos to accept Hash-m's sovereignty, Zichronos to raise a remembrance of us before Him, with the aid of the Shofar (Shofaros).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>SHOFAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> We use a ram's horn for a Shofar to allude to the Akeidah of Yitzchak.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Hash-m then considers it as though we bound ourselves in an Akeidah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yizchak):</span> Why do we blow Shofar on Rosh Hashanah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because the Torah said so!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rather, why do we blow a Teru'ah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because the Torah said so!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rather, why do we blow Teki'ah and Teru'ah both before and during the Amidah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Doing the mitzvah twice confounds the Satan.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Any year where Shofar was not blown at its beginning will suffer misfortune at its end.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The reason is that the Satan was not confounded.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>R. YITZCHAK'S STATEMENTS ON JUDGMENT AND FESTIVALS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> in any year where the people humbled themselves at the beginning, they will prosper at its end, as derived from a Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A person is judged according to his deeds at that time, as derived from a Pasuk about Yishmael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Three things remind Hash-m of a person's sins:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he walks under a collapsing wall;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he is confident in the power of his prayer;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he calls on Hash-m to judge his case against another.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanan):</span> Anyone who calls on Hash-m to judge their case against another is themselves punished first, as derived from Sarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Four things tear up the verdict against a person:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Charity, as derived from a Pasuk;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Crying out in prayer, as derived from a Pasuk;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Changing one's name, as derived from a Pasuk about Sarai/Sarah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Changing one's ways, as derived from the episode of Ninveih.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Some add - changing one's place of residence;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is derived from Avraham moving to Eretz Yisrael to become a great nation.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Others attribute that to the merit of Eretz Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>A person must greet his teacher on all festive days, as derived from a Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>A person must purify himself before each festival, as derived from a Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Pasuk prohibits touching a dead Treife animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It can't be referring to a general ban even for Yisraelim, as they aren't even prohibited from stringent Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It must be referring to a requirement to purify oneself before a festival.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>THE BOOKS OF JUDGMENT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Kruspada'i citing R. Yochanan):</span> Three books are opened on Rosh Hashanah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>That of the utterly righteous - who are signed and sealed immediately for life;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>That of the utterly wicked - who are signed and sealed immediately for death;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>That of intermediate people - whose fate is undecided until Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If they merit it, they are signed for life;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Otherwise, they are signed for death.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avin):</span> This is all derived from a Pasuk (as cited).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It is derived from a different Pasuk (as cited).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>THE BERAISA OF PEOPLES' JUDGMENTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> There are three groups of people on the day of judgment:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The utterly righteous are signed and sealed immediately for eternal life;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The utterly wicked are signed and sealed immediately for Gehinom;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Intermediate people descend to Gehinom, cry out and emerge, as derived from a Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> Hash-m tilts the scales in their favor (so they avoid Gehinom).</p></div>
