<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>VERDICTS AND THEIR REVOCATION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Whether a decree on an individual can be revoked is a dispute between Tana'im:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If two people fall sick, or stand to be executed, and one is saved;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> He was saved because his prayer was answered; it was answered because he concentrated.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> He had not yet had his verdict, the other had.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Crying out in prayer is beneficial whether before or after the verdict.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can a verdict on a community really be torn up? We see otherwise:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One Pasuk instructs atonement, the other says that it won't help;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Surely the reconciliation is that one is referring to before a verdict, the other to after?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both refer to after a verdict;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In one, the verdict was accompanied by an oath, so it cannot be torn up.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Ami citing R. Yonasan):</span> Proof of this is the Pasuk of an oath that Eli's household shall never receive atonement with Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> However, they can receive atonement through Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Abayey):</span> They can receive atonement through Torah and acts of kindness.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rava was descended from Eli's household; he studied Torah and lived 40 years.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Abayey was descended from Eli's household; he studied Torah, practiced kindness and lived 60 years.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>There was a family in Jerusalem whose members died at 18.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yochanan ben Zakai suggested that they were Eli's descendants, and told them to study Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>They did so and survived; they were afterwards called "R. Yochanan's family."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Shmuel bar Inya citing Rav):</span> How do we know that a verdict on a community is not sealed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see in a Pasuk that it is sealed!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, how do we know that even after being sealed, it can be torn up?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As the Pasuk states that Hash-m is available whenever we call Him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Another Pasuk states that He is only available at certain times?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to an individual.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is He available to an individual?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Avuha):</span> During the ten days from Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kipur;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was there a ten-day delay before Hash-m struck Naval?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah citing Rav):</span> Matching the ten meals that he gave to David's servants.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Alternate answer (R. Nachman citing Raba bar Avuha):</span> These were the ten days until Yom Kipur which Hash-m allowed for his repentance.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE JUDGMENT OF MAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah stated that all the world pass before Hash-m like Bnei Maron - what are they?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Sheep.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Alternate answer (Resh Lakish):</span> The single-file ascent of Beis Maron.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Alternate answer (R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> The soldiers of the house of David.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chana citing R. Yochanan):</span> They are all scanned with a single glance.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> This is also seen from the Pasuk speaking of "The One who formed all their hearts together";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It can't mean that He made them all united, as we see otherwise;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It must mean that the One Who formed them sees all their hearts at once.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> THE MESSENGERS OF <i>ROSH CHODESH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>For six of the months Beis Din send out messengers to inform people of the date of Rosh Chodesh:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For Nisan, because of Pesach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>For Av, because of Tishah b'Av;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>For Elul, because of Rosh Hashanah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>For Tishrei, because of the festivals;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>For Kislev, because of Chanukah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>For Adar, because of Purim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>When the Beis ha'Mikdash was standing, they would also be sent out for Iyar, because of Pesach Sheni.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">18b----------------------------------------18b</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHY THERE WERE NO MESSENGERS FOR OTHER MONTHS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not send out messengers for Tamuz and Teves also (because of their fasts):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chana bar Bizna citing R. Shimon Chasida):</span> We derive from a Pasuk that on the four fasts, in times of peace (i.e. a Beis ha'Mikdash and the Jews are not oppressed) it is forbidden to fast on them; otherwise, they are fasts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Papa):</span> The correct inference from Pasuk is as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In times of peace, it is forbidden to fast on these days;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If there are decrees against the Jews, these days are fast;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If there are no decrees but there is not peace either, fasting is optional.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Hence, since the fasts are optional, messengers are not sent for Rosh Chodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, then messengers should not be sent out for Av because of Tishah b'Av either?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Papa):</span> Tishah b'Av is different because of its multiple tragedies:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On Tishah b'Av, the first and second Batei Mikdash were destroyed, Betar was captured, and Jerusalem was razed to the ground.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE FOUR FASTS OF SORROW</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> There are four Drashos of R. Akiva with which I differ, and this is one:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"The fast of the fourth" is the ninth of Tamuz, when Jerusalem was split.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is so called because it is in the fourth month.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"The fast of the fifth" is Tishah b'Av, when the Beis ha'Mikdash was burnt.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is so called because it is in the fifth month.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"The fast of the seventh" is the third of Tishrei, when Gedalyah ben Achikam was killed by Yishmael ben Netanyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This teaches us that the death of the righteous is as significant as the burning of the Beis ha'Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It is so called because it is in the seventh month.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"The fast of the tenth" is the tenth of Teves, when the King of Bavel laid siege to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is so called because it is in the tenth month.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since this was the chronologically first event, why is it not listed first?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As it is more important to list the months in the correct order.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> I disagree; "The fast of the tenth" is the fifth of Teves, when news of the attack on Jerusalem reached the Diaspora.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>My explanation is better in that the fasts are listed in the chronological order of the events that they mark.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Akiva considers only the order of months.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>I also consider the order of events.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>MEGILAS TAANIS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav & R. Chanina):</span> Megilas Taanis (the festive days when one may not fast) is annulled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>These days are like those in the Pasuk which are only forbidden for fasting in times of a Beis ha'Mikdash, otherwise they are fasts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan & R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Megilas Taanis is not annulled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is only those in the Pasuk with which the festivity is contingent on a Beis ha'Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Kahana):</span> We see that festive days are still forbidden for fasts (in contradiction to Rav and R. Chanina):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A fast was decreed in Lod on Chanukah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer bathed himself and R. Yehoshua took a haircut.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>They rebuked others for fasting on Chanukah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosef):</span> Chanukah is different because it is a mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Abayey):</span> But if festive days are annulled, it would no longer be a mitzvah!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosef):</span> Rather, Chanukah is different because it has become popularized and universally adopted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Acha bar Huna):</span> We see that Megilas Taanis was not annulled:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yavan decreed that the Jews may not mention the Name of Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When the Chashmona'im were victorious, they decreed that people should even write the Name of Hash-m in their legal documents.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>People would write, "In year such-and-such to Yochanan, Kohen Gadol to Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The Chachamim were concerned that after people had paid their debts, they would throw the documents away.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>On the third of Tishrei, they revoked the decree to write Hash-m's Name in documents, and made that day a festival.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>If Megilas Taanis was annulled, how could they make a new such festive day?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This day was only made into a festival for when the Beis ha'Mikdash is standing.</p>
