<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE NEW YEAR FOR ESROGIM (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah bar. R. Huna's statement should read that even though R. Gamliel ruled that Esrog follows its harvesting for Ma'aser (like vegetables), its new year begins in Shevat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does this Tosefta speak of the third year entering the fourth, while the other one (on 12b) speaks of the second entering the third?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It incidentally teaches us that since Esrog trees don't react well to being handled during Shevi'is, it takes three years for fruit to be produced afterwards.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> When is the new year for Esrogim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yanai):</span> Shevat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> Does this mean the lunar month of Shevat, or Shevat of the solar season (thirty days following the Teves solstice)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yanai):</span> The lunar month of Shevat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava/ R. Yochanan):</span> In a leap year, is the new year Shevat or the month preceding the final month i.e. Adar Rishon?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Nachman/ R. Yanai):</span> We follow the majority of years (the month called Shevat).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SIXTH AND SEVENTH YEAR ESROGIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> A sixth-year Esrog which was picked in the Shemitah year is exempt from Ma'aser and Biyur (removal of Shmitah produce).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A seventh-year Esrog which was picked in the eighth year is exempt from Ma'aser and subject to Biyur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> The second rule takes a stringent approach; but the rule that the first case is exempt from Biyur must be because we follow the sprouting - if so, it should be subject to Ma'aser?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Since everyone handles it in the Shemitah year (and it is effectively ownerless), it is not subject to Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Hamnuna):</span> A sixth-year Esrog which was picked in the Shemitah year is fully rated as sixth-year fruit.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A seventh-year Esrog which was picked in the eighth year is rated as seventh year (Shemitah) fruit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa contradicts both Rabah and R. Hamnuna:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ben Yehudah citing R. Shimon):</span> A sixth-year Esrog which was picked in the Shemitah year is exempt from both Ma'aser and Biyur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Produce is only subject to Ma'aser if it both grew and was picked in a Ma'aser year.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>A seventh-year Esrog which was picked in the eighth year is exempt from both Ma'aser and Biyur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Produce is only subject to Biyur if it both grew and was picked in the Shemitah year.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>The first part contradicts R. Hamnuna, and the second part contradicts both!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> These rules are a dispute between Tana'im in a Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> Avtulmos testified that we follow the harvesting of Esrogim for Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Rabbis voted that we follow the harvesting for both Ma'aser and Shemitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who mentioned anything about Shemitah?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">15b----------------------------------------15b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Emend it to read that Avtulmos also said that we follow the sprouting of Esrogim for Shemitah (and Rabah and R. Hamnuna follow this view).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan and Resh Lakish):</span> A sixth-year Esrog which was picked in the Shemitah year is fully rated as sixth-year fruit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravin citing R. Yochanan):</span> Even an Esrog that grew mostly in the seventh year is rated as sixth-year fruit and is Tevel.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DETERMINING TO WHICH YEAR TREES BELONG</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> A tree whose fruit sprouted before the 15th of Shevat has Ma'aser taken according to the previous year; otherwise, it is taken according to the present year.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nechemiah):</span> This only holds true for a tree that gives two broods a year.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Birds, not trees, produce broods!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means like two broods in that the fruit does not all ripen at once.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>But a tree that gives one brood (such as dates, olives, and carobs) has Ma'aser taken according to when they are picked (even if they sprouted before the 15th of Shevat).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> With carob trees, people customarily follow R. Nechemiah (following when the carobs are picked).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Resh Lakish to R. Yochanan):</span> We see that even trees whose fruit ripen all at once follow the sprouting:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>White figs have Shemitah laws in the second year of the Shemitah cycle (because they started growing three years ago.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> No answer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba haKohen):</span> Why didn't R. Yochanan reply that he was quoting R. Nechemiah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi haKohen):</span> Because Resh Lakish would protest that he can't abandon the Rabanan in favor of R. Nechemiah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba haKohen):</span> Why didn't R. Yochanan say that he is simply reporting what people do, not authorizing it!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi haKohen):</span> Because Resh Lakish would reply that one can't allow such a custom to take place in the face of a prohibition.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba haKohen):</span> Why didn't R. Yochanan say that Ma'aser for carob trees is only d'Rabanan anyway!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"I wonder if Resh Lakish really asked this question to R. Yochanan."</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But he did ask it!?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Aba means that he wonders if R. Yochanan had no answer, or if he felt that it wasn't a question (because carobs are d'Rabanan).</p></div>
