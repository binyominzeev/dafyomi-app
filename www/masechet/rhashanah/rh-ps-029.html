<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>KAVANAH OF THE ONE BLOWING THE SHOFAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Zeira told his assistant to have Kavanah when blowing Shofar for him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We see that he holds that the one blowing must have Kavanah</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We find that if someone was passing by a Shul and heard the Shofar or Megillah, then he is Yotzei only if he had Kavanah - but in any case, the one blowing certainly didn't have Kavanah for him!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The one blowing is a Shali'ach Tzibur who has Kavanah for everyone.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We find that both the Shofar-blower and the listener must have Kavanah. The implication is that if the listener had Kavanah but not the blower, he is not Yotzei - which must refer to the blower not having <i>himself</i> in mind and not being Yotzei (just like the other case mentioned there, namely,of the listener, who did also not have Kavanah that he himself should be Yotzei). But if he did have himself in mind, they are Yotzei even though he had nobody else in mind!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Machlokes Tana'im:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> The one blowing does not need any specific Kavanah for anyone.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> That is only true for a Shali'ach Tzibur, otherwise both blower and listener must have Kavanah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MISHNAH: MOSHE'S HANDS AND SHOFAR-BLOWERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Pasuk says that the Bnei Yisrael were victorious when Moshe's hands were raised, as it signified that their hearts were directed Heavenwards.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Similarly, the copper snake had no innate healing powers, but it caused people to direct their hearts Heavenwards.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A deaf-mute, fool or minor cannot blow Shofar for the rest of us.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The principle is that anyone not obligated in something cannot perform other's obligations in it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>OBLIGATIONS FOR SHOFAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A Beraisa discusses the obligations for Shofar:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Everyone is obligated in Shofar, including Kohanim, Levi'im, Yisraelim, converts, freed servants, Tumtum, Androgenus, and one is half enslaved and half free.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Tumtum cannot be Motzi either another Tumtum or other people.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>An Androgenus can be Motzi another Androgenus but nobody else.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Someone who is half enslaved and half free cannot be Motzi either a similar person or anyone else.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need to be told that Kohanim, Levi'im and Yisraelim need to hear Shofar?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggested answer:</span> We might have thought that Kohanim are exempt, as it is called a "day" of Shofar, and their obligation is year-round with the trumpets of the Olos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Trumpets are a different matter to Shofros!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Replacement answer:</span> We might have thought that Kohanim are exempt for a different reason:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah said that Rosh Hashanah and Yovel are the same regarding Shofar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We might have taken this to mean that those who are exempt from Yovel are exempt from Shofar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Kohanim are exempt from Yovel in that they can sell their property at all times and redeem it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>FULFILLING OBLIGATIONS FOR OTHERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Huna):</span> Although someone who is half enslaved and half free cannot be Motzi either a similar person or anyone else, he can be Motzi himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Nachman):</span> Just as his slave half cannot be Motzi someone else's free half, it also cannot be Motzi his own free half!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Therefore, he cannot be Motzi himself either.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Beraisa confirms this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Although a person has been Yotzei a Berachah for himself, he can still be Motzi others, except for Berachos on food and suchlike.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">29b----------------------------------------29b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Can a person be Motzi others with the Berachah on matzah or the wine of Kidush after he has already been Yotzei?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Do we say that this Berachah is part of the obligation or not?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ashi):</span> R. Papi used to make Kidush for us and then for his worker.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>A person should not make a Berachah for his guests if he is not himself eating.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But he can do so for his children and household in order to educate them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>A person may read Hallel and Megillah to be Motzi others even though he has already been Yotzei.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>MISHNAH: ROSH HASHANAH ON SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>If Rosh Hashanah fell on Shabbos, they would blow Shofar only in the Beis ha'Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>After the Destruction, R. Yochanan ben Zakai decreed that it should be blown in every town with a Beis Din.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Elazar said that this decree was only for Yavneh, but others disagreed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>With Yerushalayim, all nearby towns could also blow Shofar on Shabbos, whereas with Yavneh no other towns could do so.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>THE SOURCE FOR THE MISHNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that Shofar must not be blown on Shabbos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Although one Pasuk says that it should be a day of Teru'ah, another says that it should be merely a <i>remembrance</i> for Teru'ah, which must be referring to where it fell on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If it is forbidden d'Oraisa, how could they blow it on Shabbos in the Beis ha'Mikdash?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> It's not a Melachah anyway; as with removing the bread from the oven, it is a Chochmah</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Replacement answer (Rava):</span> It is permitted d'Oraisa; the Rabanan prohibited it, in accordance with Rabah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> Everyone is obligated to blow Shofar, but not everyone is competent to do so.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>There is therefore a concern that a person might carry it on Shabbos to an expert for instruction.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It is for this reason that the Rabanan forbade Lulav and Megilah on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>POST-DESTRUCTION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Once, when Rosh Hashanah fell on Shabbos, all the towns went to Yavneh to hear the Shofar blown.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Bnei Beseirah asked R. Yochanan ben Zakai to judge whether the decree of not blowing the Shofar should be applied.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He told them to blow the Shofar first, and afterwards he said that it was too late to judge it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the Mishnah, those who said that the Shofar was not only blown on Shabbos in Yavneh but also in every town with a Beis Din are saying the same thing as the Tana Kama!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The difference is with a temporary Beis Din, which only the Tana Kama would permit to blow a Shofar on Shabbos.</p></div>
