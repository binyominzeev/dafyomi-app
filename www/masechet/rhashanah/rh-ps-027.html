<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE MOUTHPIECE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah states that the mouthpiece must be overlaid with gold, but a Beraisa states that this invalidates the Shofar!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is referring to placing the gold at a distance from where one places one's mouth.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE ACCOMPANYING TRUMPETS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely it is impossible to hear both the Shofar and the trumpets:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Zachor" and "Shamor" were said by Hash-m simultaneously, which the mouth cannot say and the ear cannot hear.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Shofar was therefore sounded for longer than the trumpets.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We see from this that it suffices to hear the end of the Shofar blast alone, and by inference to hear the beginning alone.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see that this is not so, as if the end Teki'ah was double-length, it still does not count as the first Teki'ah of the next set!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The note has not been separated into two.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "If someone blows a Shofar into a pit, cistern or barrel, then he is Yotzei if he hears the sound of the Shofar, but not if he hears the echo" - but why doesn't the first part of the note (before it combines with the echo) suffice?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Replacement answer:</span> Two sounds from two sources can be discerned; but from a single source, they cannot be discerned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see that two sounds from two sources cannot be discerned, as a Beraisa states that two people may not simultaneously translate for the one reading from the Torah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the Seifa, it states that even ten people may simultaneously recite Hallel and Megillah; since people are eager to hear it, they can discern the words, and the same is true for Shofar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so (that two sounds from two sources can be discerned), why is the Shofar sounded for longer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In order to show that the mitzvah of the day is the Shofar.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE TRUMPETS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Shofar of Rosh Hashanah have its mouthpiece covered with gold, and that of a Ta'anis is covered with silver?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We see in a Pasuk that assemblies (such as a Ta'anis) require silver.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate answer:</span> The Torah is concerned that we shouldn't have too high expenses.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why is the Shofar of Rosh Hashanah covered with gold?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The honor of Yom Tov is a more important consideration.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Rav Papa bar Shmuel wanted to use a Shofar and trumpets as described in the Mishnah, but Rava told him that it only applies to the Beis ha'Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Likewise, a Beraisa states that only in the Beis ha'Mikdash was there both; but elsewhere, on a Ta'anis there was no Shofar and on Rosh Hashanah (and Yovel) there were no trumpets.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Chalafta in Tzippori ruled to use a Shofar and trumpets, as did R. Chananyah ben Tradyon in Sichni.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When the matter came before the Chachamim, they ruled that this was only to be done in the Beis ha'Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The source for this is the Pasuk which states that the trumpets together with the Shofar are to be sounded (only) before Hash-m (i.e. in the Beis ha'Mikdash).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>YOVEL AND ROSH HASHANAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Our Tefilah on Rosh Hashanah that it is the day of creation follows the view of R. Eliezer that the world was created in Tishrei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah states that Yovel has the same Berachos as Rosh Hashanah - but it doesn't contain this!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That statement only refers to the rest of the Tefillos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>An alternative reading presents this as an answer to the suggestion that the Mishnah cannot follow R. Eliezer.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>MISHNAH: LAWS OF SHOFAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A Shofar that split and was glued together is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A Shofar that was made from pieces that were glued together is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A Shofar which had a hole that was stopped up is only valid if it did not impede the sound.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If someone blows a Shofar into a pit, cistern or barrel, then he is Yotzei if he hears the sound of the Shofar, but not if he hears the echo.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If someone was passing by a Shul and heard the Shofar or Megillah, then he is Yotzei only if he had in mind to be.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>ALTERATIONS TO THE SHOFAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A Beraisa states:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Shofar that was shortened is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Shofar that was scraped down is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>A Shofar that was covered with gold is only Kosher if this was not done at the mouthpiece.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If it was coated with gold on the inside, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>If it was coated on the outside, it is only Kosher if it does not change its sound.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>If one Shofar was inserted inside another, it is only Kosher if the sound of the inner one is heard.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A Beraisa states:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a Shofar was scraped down, whether from the outside or inside, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it was scraped down to the thinnest layer, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If one Shofar was inserted inside another, it is only Kosher if the sound of the inner one is heard.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If a Shofar was inverted, it is not Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This doesn't mean that it was turned inside-out, but rather that the narrow end was widened and the wide end was narrowed.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>It is Pasul because we see from a Pasuk that it must be carried in the same way as the animal carries it (i.e. without alteration).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>ADDITIONS TO THE SHOFAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A Beraisa states:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If anything was added to the Shofar, whether made from horn or not, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If a hole was filled, whether with horn or another material, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nosson):</span> If it was filled with horn, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This is only true if most of the original Shofar is intact.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The inference is that if a different material was used, it is Pasul even if most of it is intact.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(Alternate version) (R. Yochanan):</span> If it was filled with a different material, it is Pasul only if most of the original is gone.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The inference is that if it is filled with horn, it is Kosher if most of it is intact.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>If it was coated with gold on the inside, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>If it was coated on the outside, it is only Kosher if it does not change its sound.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>If it was split along its length, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>If it was split along its width, it is Kosher only if the minimum size for a Shofar remains intact.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The minimum size is such that it can be grasped in one's hand and protrude on either side.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p>If the sound was thin, thick or dry, it is Kosher, as all sounds are Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">(Sent to Shmuel's father):</span> If it was pierced, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious - how else is it to be blown?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that they left the bone inside it and pierced the bone.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>The Chidush is that it is not a Chatzitzah, as it is of the same kind as the horn.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>BLOWING INTO A PIT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Huna):</span> It is only those standing outside the pit who are not Yotzei, but those inside the pit are Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Beraisa, which states that they are Yotzei, supports this qualification.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Some learn it as a contradiction and resolve it in this way.</p></div>
