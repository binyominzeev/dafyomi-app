<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE NEW YEAR FOR KINGS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the relevance of the new year for kings?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In order to discern that a contract is pre-dated (and thus invalid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">First Beraisa:</span> When a king is appointed on the 29th of Adar, that day counts as the first year of his reign.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that the new year for kings is the first of Nisan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It also teaches that one day can count as a year.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>But when a king is appointed on the first of Nisan, it is not counted as a year until the following Nisan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is needed to teach that when the king was selected in Adar (but not yet coronated), it is not counted as his first year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Second Beraisa:</span> If a king died and was succeeded in Adar, that year is counted for both kings.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is needed to teach that one day can count as a whole year (for the deceased king) even when it is at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If a king died in Adar and was succeeded by the new king in Nisan, the first year is counted for the first (deceased) king and the second year is counted for the second (new) king.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is needed to teach that even in a case when the second king was already selected in Adar, and he is the son of the first king,, nevertheless he counts his first year from Nisan. when he is coronated.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE SOURCE OF NISAN AS THE NEW YEAR FOR KINGS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Source #1 (R. Yochanan) The new year for kings is learned from a verse (Melachim I 6,1) that connects the years of King Shlomo's reign to the years from the Exodus, which itself is counted from Nisan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the years from the Exodus are counted from Nisan and not from Tishrei?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah's considering Aharon's death in Av (Bamidbar 33, 38) and Moshe's subsequent speech in Shevat (Devarim 1,3) as being in the same (40th) year, shows that the year cannot begin from Tishrei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the year of Moshe's speech is being counted from the Exodus and not from the building of the Mishkan which was a year later?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (based on Rav Papa's statement later):</span> The identical phrase (Gezeirah Shava) of "the fortieth year" in each verse shows that they are both being counted from the Exodus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that Moshe's speech was subsequent to Aharon's death? Perhaps it was before his death!.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Moshe's speech was after Sichon's death (Devarim 1,4) and when Aharon died Sichon was still alive.This can be proven as follows</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The verse (Bamidmar 21,1) states that "the Cana'ani King Arad heard" (that Aharon died) and he attacked Israel.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>'The previous verse (Bamidmar 20,29) states that Israel "saw that ("ki") Aharon died" is understood as "they feared (attack) because Aharon died."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>This is in accordance with Resh Lakish's teaching that "ki" can only mean 'if," "perhaps," "rather," and "because" (in this case, it means "because") and not "that".</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need to know about Sichon, but the verse speaks of Arad and not Sichon!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Sichon, Arad and Cana'an are all the same person. He was named "Sichon" because he was as wild as a foal ("Siach"); "Cana'an" was his kingdom; and "Arad" was his name; Alternatively, he was named "Arad" because he was as wild as a wild ass ("Arod"); "Cana'an" was his kingdom; and "Sichon" was his name.</p>
