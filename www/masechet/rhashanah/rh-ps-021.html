<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>YOM KIPUR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Levi went to Bavel and commented that what they thought was the 11th of Tishrei was actually Yom Kipur as declared in Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He refused to testify to that as he hadn't heard Beis Din sanctify Rosh Chodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yochanan announced that any place which is reached by the messengers of Nisan but not by those of Tishrei must also keep two days of Pesach; he rebuked his students who did otherwise.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rava would observe two days of Yom Kipur in case Elul was a full month, and he was once found justified.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Nachman was once told at the end of Yom Kipur that the following day was being observed as Yom Kipur in Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He blamed the informer for being the death of him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CALCULATING NISAN AND <i>PESACH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>If the winter season extends to the 16th of Nisan, the year should be made into a leap year.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The reason is that the Pasuk instructs us to ensure that Nisan falls in spring.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Nachman instructed sailors to burn the chametz when the moon shines until sunrise.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely that happens on the 15th of Nisan, and the chametz must be burned on the 14th?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> On the open ocean, it is seen on the 14th.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> TRANSGRESSING <i>SHABBOS </i>FOR TESTIMONY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Witnesses of the new moon can transgress Shabbos to inform Beis Din only for the months of Nisan and Tishrei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Messengers would be sent to Suria and the dates of the festivals were contingent on these.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>When the Beis ha'Mikdash was standing, they could transgress Shabbos for all months, so that the Rosh Chodesh Korbanos could be correctly brought.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>TRANSGRESSING <i>SHABBOS </i>FOR MESSAGE DELIVERY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would messengers be sent to Suria only for these two months?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In an earlier Mishnah, it stated that they are sent for six months!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are sent for six months, but they may only transgress Shabbos for two.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because on these two months they may only leave after hearing Beis Din formally sanctify the month, which shortens the available journey time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A Pasuk teaches us that the festivals must be declared on time, even at the cost of transgressing Shabbos (by witnesses).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might think that we may also transgress Shabbos to ensure that they are <i>observed</i> on time (i.e. to send messengers).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But the Pasuk states that it is only for their <i>declaration</i> that Shabbos is transgressed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Originally, witnesses would transgress Shabbos for all festivals; after the destruction of the Beis ha'Mikdash, R. Yochanan said that since there are no Korbanos, Shabbos may only be transgressed for Nisan and Tishrei.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> CLEAR MOONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Whether or not the moon was clearly visible to all, the witnesses may transgress Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> If it was visible to all, they may not transgress Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Forty pairs of witnesses once came but were detained by R. Akiva at Lod.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Gamliel warned that this would discourage them from coming in the future.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>THE GATES OF UNDERSTANDING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A Pasuk is brought to show that the Mishnah is referring to the moon being clearly visible.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The end of the Pasuk speaks of seven times seven.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This refers to the 49 of 50 gates of understanding that were given to Moshe.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Koheles wanted that also, but was told that nobody could be like Moshe.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Alternate opinion):</span> There could only be no prophet like Moshe, but there could be a king like Moshe.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Koheles' request was to pass judgments without eyewitnesses and warnings, but was instructed otherwise.</p>
