<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There would be no point in establishing the 3rd of Tishrei as a festive day for when the Beis ha'Mikdash is standing, as it would anyway be festive as it is the fast of Gedalyah (which is a festival in the time of the Beis ha'Mikdash standing)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> The point would be to prohibit the preceding day for fasting.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The preceding day would anyway be forbidden for fasting, as it is the day after Rosh Chodesh!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rosh Chodesh is a d'Oraisa festival, which does not need the reinforcement of prohibiting fasting on the following day:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The festive days listed in Megilas Taanis are forbidden for fasting on the days preceding and following them as well.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>With Shabbos and Yom Tov, one may fast on the preceding and following days.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The reason is that the latter are d'Oraisa, which don't need reinforcement, whereas the former are d'Rabanan and need reinforcement.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The preceding day would anyway be forbidden for fasting, as it is the day before the day when Gedalyah was killed!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ashi):</span> The fast of Gedalyah is Divrei Kabalah (from Nevi'im) which is like a d'Oraisa fast in that it does not need reinforcement.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MEGILAS TAANIS - THE TWENTY-NINTH OF ADAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Tuvi bar Masna):</span> We see that Megilas Taanis was not annulled:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The government decreed that Jews may not study Torah or circumcise their sons and that they must transgress Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Yehudah ben Shamua and his friends asked advice from a princess who was familiar with all the prominent Romans.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>She advised them to make a demonstration at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>They did so, and said, "We are all brothers, why do you persecute us?"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>The decrees were annulled, and that day (the 29th of Adar) became a festival.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>If Megilas Taanis was annulled, how could they make a new such festive day?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This day was only made into a festival for when the Beis ha'Mikdash is standing.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Yehudah ben Shamua was a disciple of R. Meir, who lived after the Beis ha'Mikdash:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a glass vessel (which became Tamei) was punctured (to make it Tahor) and the hole filled with lead;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ben Gamliel citing Yehudah ben Shamua citing R. Meir):</span> It reverts to its Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> It is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Whether Megilas Taanis was annulled is a dispute between Tannaim in a Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> The days listed in Megilas Taanis are forbidden for fasting whether or not the Beis ha'Mikdash is standing.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> They are only forbidden for fasting when the Beis ha'Mikdash is standing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Halachah is that these days were annulled.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Halachah is that these days were not annulled.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is a contradiction!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is only Chanukah and Purim that were not annulled.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE MESSENGERS FOR ELUL AND TISHREI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since messengers were sent out for Rosh Chodesh Elul, why do they need to be sent out for Tishrei?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In case Elul became a full month.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chanina bar Kahana citing Rav stated that we do not find that Elul has ever been a full month since the time of Ezra!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "We don't find it" because it was never necessary; but if necessary, it would be made a full month.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If that were to happen, people in the Diaspora would keep Rosh Hashanah on the wrong day!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Better for that to happen than for the festivals to be kept on the wrong days.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This can be deduced from the Mishnah's statement that messengers were sent out for Tishrei to ensure that the festivals are kept at the correct time.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE MESSENGERS FOR ADAR SHENI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Mishnah does not state that, in the event of a leap year, messengers would be sent out for Adar Sheni because of Purim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We see that the Mishnah does not follow Rebi:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rebi):</span> In the event of a leap year, messengers would be sent out for Adar Sheni because of Purim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they are arguing about whether all the mitzvos of Adar Sheni apply in Adar Rishon (and therefore one can fulfill one's obligations then)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All agree that the mitzvos do not apply in Adar Rishon; the dispute is over the length of Adar Rishon, as in a Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> Adar Rishon is thirty days.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> Adar Rishon is one month (assumed to mean 29 days).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In either case, they know when Adar Sheni will arrive?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Papa):</span> The view that it is one month holds that it can be 29 or 30 days (and messengers would need to be sent).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE LENGTH OF ADAR RISHON AND SHENI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Yehoshua ben Levi testified that the Jerusalem community would make the 30th day of each Adar into the first of the next month.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We see that both months would always be abridged, unlike the following view:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman bar Chisda):</span> R. Simai testified in the name of Chagai, Zacharyah and Malachi that both or either months of Adar could be made full or abridged.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Thus was the custom in the Diaspora.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rav's view was cited that Adar Rishon was always full and Adar Sheni always abridged unless a message was sent from Eretz Yisrael otherwise.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A message was sent to Mar Ukva that the Adar closest to Nisan is always abridged.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Nachman):</span> We see otherwise:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The witnesses of the moon for the months of Nisan and Tishrei can transgress Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>That makes sense if the months were sometimes full and sometimes abridged.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>But if the Adar closest to Nisan was always abridged, why should they be allowed to transgress Shabbos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because it is a mitzvah to sanctify the month on the basis of eyewitness testimony.</p></div>
