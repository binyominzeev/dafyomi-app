<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>SHOFAR IN THE PRESENCE OF BEIS DIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Huna):</span> (Referring to the opinion in the Mishnah that the Shofar was blown on Shabbos not only in Yavneh, but also in every place where there as a Beis Din) The Shofar was blown with Beis Din - i.e. in their presence.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> We see otherwise:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah states that there was an "additional" advantage of Yerushalayim over Yavneh - additional to what?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It could mean that in Yerushalayim, individuals would blow Shofar, whereas in Yavneh, only the Shali'ach Beis Din would blow Shofar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>But R. Yitzchak bar Yosef testified that in Yavneh, everyone would blow Shofar!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>So it must mean that whereas in Yavneh the Shofar could only be blown when Beis Din was in session, in Yerushalayim the Shofar could be blown at any time.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>But nevertheless in Yavneh the Shofar could be blown while Beis Din was in session - even if it was not in their presence!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is additional to the advantage that in Yavneh, the Shofar was only blown in the presence of Beis Din.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SHOFAR DURING THE TIME OF BEIS DIN'S SESSION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Some attribute R. Huna's statement to a different context:</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Pasuk teaches us that every individual must blow Shofar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Huna):</span> The Shofar was blown with Beis Din - i.e. during the time of their session.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> We see otherwise:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Shofar must be blown on Shabbos Yom Kipur of Yovel by "Ish u'Veiso."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Ish u'Veiso" can't mean man and wife, as women are not obligated in a time-related Mitzvos Aseh!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>So it must mean "Ish b'Veiso" - in his house, i.e. even not during the time of Beis Din's session!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it must still be during the time of Beis Din's session.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Sheshes):</span> We see otherwise:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Yovel is equal to Rosh Hashanah regarding Shofar except that with Yovel, every Beis Din blows Shofar and even individuals, whereas with Rosh Hashanah only Beis Din that sanctified the month would blow Shofar, and individuals are not obligated.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>What does it mean by "individuals are not obligated"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It can't mean that individuals do not blow Shofar, as there was testimony from Yavneh that they do!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>So it must mean that on Rosh Hashanah they would blow only when they were in session, whereas on Yovel, they would blow Shofar even when Beis Din was not in session!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it means that on Yovel they would blow Shofar even not in the presence of Beis Din, but still only during the time when they were in session.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This rule is confirmed by another source.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> If Beis Din have closed court and are ready to leave, is that still considered the time of Beis Din's session?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Teyku.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE VICINITY OF YERUSHALAYIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Mishnah said that all towns within sight and hearing of Yerushalayim, close and able to come, would also blow Shofar on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>"Within sight" excludes those towns that are in valleys.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>"Within hearing" excludes those towns that are on hilltops.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>"Close" excludes those beyond the Techum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>"Able to come" excludes those separated by a river.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MISHNAH: LULAV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Originally, Lulav was taken for seven days in the Beis ha'Mikdash, and on one day elsewhere.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>After the Destruction, R. Yochanan ben Zakai decreed that it should be taken for seven days everywhere, to commemorate the Beis ha'Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>He also forbade the eating of Chadash on the sixteenth of Nisan.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>COMMEMORATING THE BEIS HA'MIKDASH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that there is a need for a commemoration?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk states that someone has to care about Tziyon.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>THE EATING OF CHADASH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was eating of Chadash on the sixteenth of Nisan forbidden?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When the Beis ha'Mikdash will be rebuilt, people will say that just as they ate last year on the morning of the sixteenth, so too they can eat this year (without realizing that when there is a Beis ha'Mikdash, Chadash remains forbidden until the Omer has been brought.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When are we concerned about the Beis ha'Mikdash being rebuilt?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It can't be on the sixteenth of Nisan - because there would be no problem, as Chadash would indeed become permitted from the morning of the sixteenth!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It can't be on the fifteenth of Nisan - as it would be permitted from after midday, for we have learned that those who come from afar are allowed to eat it then, as it is presumed that the Omer has already been brought!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is referring to where it is rebuilt on the afternoon or evening of the fifteenth, when there won't be time to bring the Omer.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">30b----------------------------------------30b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> R. Yochanan ben Zakai's decree was based on R. Yehudah's principle:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> The Pasuk forbids eating Chadash until the sixteenth.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Until" is inclusive - i.e. the entire day of the sixteenth is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely we find that they argue as to whether it is forbidden d'Oraisa or d'Rabanan!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah mistakenly understood R. Yochanan ben Zakai to have meant d'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Yochanan ben Zakai used the term "decreed," implying d'Rabanan?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that, based on the Pasuk, he decreed it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE TIMES FOR ACCEPTING TESTIMONY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Originally, testimony about the new moon would be accepted all day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Once, the witnesses were delayed, and the Levi'im made a mistake with the Shir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>It was thereafter decreed that witnesses would only be accepted until Minchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If they come afterwards, both that day and the next day are observed as Rosh Chodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>After the Destruction, R. Yochanan ben Zakai decreed that testimony could be accepted all day.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>THE MISTAKE WITH THE SHIR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the mistake with the Shir?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (from Bavel):</span> They didn't sing at all.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate answer (R. Zeira):</span> They sang the weekday Shir with the Tamid (instead of the festival Shir).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Zeira quoted a Beraisa that 'They instituted not to receive the witnesses after Minchah, in order that there should be sufficient time in the day to bring the Temidin, the Musafin and the drink-offerings without mishap.' Doesn't 'without mishap' imply that it was to avoid singing the wrong Shir?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Not singing it at all is the biggest mishap of all.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Acha bar Huna):</span> We see that they sang the Shir of the wrong day:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>On the morning of the thirtieth of Elul - the Levi'im would generally sing the regular Shir of whichever day it was.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>... at Musaf, if that day was declared Rosh Hashanah - "Harninu" (The Shir shel Yom for Thursday).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>... at Shachris, if the witnesses came before the Tamid shel Shachar, and it was a Thursday morning - "Hasirosi" (the second half of "Harninu"). This is in order to avoid repeating the same Shir twice on the same day, where it could be avoided.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>... at Musaf, in the same case, if the witnesses came <i>after</i> the Tamid shel Shachar - "Harninu" (even though it meant repeating it - because it was unavoidable).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>We see here that, in cases of doubt, they would sing the weekday Shir, and that was why it was a case of repeating it!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In that case, they sang the Shir because it was suited to that day anyway.</p></div>
