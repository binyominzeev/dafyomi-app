<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE FORM AND MAKE-UP OF THE BLASTS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the threefold Teki'ah-Teru'ah-Teki'ah should be blown three times?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Three Pesukim mention Teru'ah (and we know that Teru'ah is always preceded and followed by Teki'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One of these Pesukim refers to Yovel, and the other two refer to Rosh Hashanah - how do we know to apply them to each other?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah says the phrase "seventh month" in both contexts to make a Gezerah Shaveh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Thus, the Shofar is blown in three sets which consist of a total of nine blasts; the length of a Teki'ah is like a Teru'ah, and the length of a Teru'ah is like three Shevarim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Originally, the Tana linked the laws of Rosh Hashanah and Yovel by means of a Hekesh (7d on previous Daf), yet he now uses a Gezerah Shaveh!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means that were it not for the Gezerah Shaveh, he would have used the Hekesh, but now that he has a Gezerah Shaveh, the Hekesh is not needed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>AN ALTERNATE SOURCE: THE WILDERNESS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Another Tana learns that the Teru'ah is preceded and followed by a Teki'ah from the description of the wilderness encampment:</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>"u'Tekaatem Teru'ah" is an instruction for a separate Teki'ah and Teru'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it refers to blowing a single Teru'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A later Pasuk speaks of there being a Teki'ah without a Teru'ah, so this Pasuk must mean that both are present.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the Teki'ah precedes the Teru'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because "u'Tekaatem" precedes "Teru'ah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that a Teki'ah follows the Teru'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because another Pasuk says "Teru'ah" and then "Yiska'u."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yishmael):</span> A simpler source is that it superfluously says that "u'Tekaatem Teru'ah for a <i>second</i> time," teaching us that a Teki'ah is always sounded after a Teru'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That was only said in reference to the desert encampment; how do we know to apply it to Rosh Hashanah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We link them with a Gezerah Shaveh from the words "Teru'ah" in each context.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Three Teru'os are mentioned in the context of Rosh Hashanah, each accompanied by two Teki'os, resulting in three Teru'os and six Teki'os; two from the Torah, and one from the Rabanan (as the third Pasuk is used for the Gezerah Shaveh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> Two are from the Rabanan, as another Pasuk is needed to teach us that it may only be sounded by day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yishmael learns that from "Yom ha'Kipurim."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he is learning from the Yom Kipur of Yovel, why doesn't he also learn the Teki'os preceding and following the Teru'os from there?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As he doesn't feel that the word "ve'Haavarta" indicates a Teki'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He uses it instead to teach us that the Shofar must be used in the form that the animal carries it (and not inverted); and he uses the word "Taaviru" to teach that the Shofar must be carried by hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The other opinion feels that since the Torah used the unusual term "Taaviru," it must be like the other usage of that term which refers to sound.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is being learned from the wilderness encampment, perhaps it refers to trumpets, as was the case there?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk says that the Shofar should be blown on the festival when the moon is covered i.e. Rosh Hashanah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>R. AVAHU'S ORDER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Avahu decreed in Kisari that Teki'ah, three Shevarim, Teru'ah, then Teki'ah should be blown.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Yevava (the translation of Yom Teru'ah) means whimpering, then it should be Teki'ah-Teru'ah-Teki'ah, and if it means moaning, then it should be Teki'ah-Shevarim-Teki'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>He was in doubt as to which it meant.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it does mean whimpering, then the Shevarim is interrupting between the Teki'ah and the Teru'ah!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He must therefore also sound a Teki'ah-Teru'ah-Teki'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it does mean moaning, then the Teru'ah is interrupting between the Shevarim and the Teki'ah!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He must therefore also sound a Teki'ah-Shevarim-Teki'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he is anyway doing both these versions, what was the point of instituting Teki'ah-Shevarim-Teru'ah-Teki'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In case it Yevava means both moaning and whimpering.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In that case he should also sound Teki'ah-Teru'ah-Shevarim-Teki'ah, in case it means whimpering followed by moaning?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The usual case is that when a person is upset he first moans and then whimpers.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DELAYS DURING THE SHOFAR BLASTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If he heard the nine blasts spread over nine hours of the day, he is Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A Beraisa confirms this:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he heard the nine blasts spread over nine hours of the day, he is Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he heard them from nine people simultaneously, he is not Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he heard them from nine people sequentially, he is Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>This is true even if there were gaps between them, and even if they were spread over the entire day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely R. Yochanan said that if, during the reading of Hallel or Megillah, there was a delay of a period of time adequate to finish it, he must start again?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This was not his own opinion; he was citing R. Shimon ben Yehotzadak.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we see that he also held of it, as when R. Avahu paused during reciting Shema when passing dirty alleys, R. Yochanan told him that if the delay was long enough to finish it, he must begin again?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He meant to say "According to me, there was no need either to pause or to start again after a long pause; but according to you that both are true, the length of such a pause is the time that it would take to finish it."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The trumpet blasts and Berachos of a fast day are not essential to each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Shofar blasts and Berachos of Rosh Hashanah, and Yom Kipur of Yovel, are essential to each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The reason is that on Rosh Hashanah Hash-m instructs us to say Malchuyos to accept His sovereignty, Zichronos to raise a remembrance of us before Him, with the aid of the Shofar (Shofaros).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>SHOFAR AND <i>TEFILAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that if one said Musaf and only then gained access to a Shofar, he should blow Teki'ah-Teru'ah-Teki'ah three times.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The implication is that if he did have a Shofar originally, he should hear it during Musaf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Papa bar Shmuel told his attendant that when he signals to him during his Amidah, he should blow the Shofar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Sounding the Shofar during the Amidah is only done with a congregation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A Beraisa supports Rava:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He should hear the Shofar blasts in the proper order, and during the order of the Berachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is only true for a congregation, but an individual does not hear the Shofar during the Berachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>An individual who did not blow Shofar can have someone else blow for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>But an individual who did not recite the Amidah cannot have someone else recite it for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>It is better to be with those who sound Shofar than to be with those who say Musaf - faced with a choice of two cities, one doing each, you should go to the city with Shofar.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious - Shofar is d'Oraisa, and Musaf is d'Rabanan?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to a case where one city is definitely saying Musaf, and the other is only possibly sounding Shofar.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>THE SHALI'ACH TZIBUR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that just as the Shali'ach Tzibur must say the prayer, so too must every individual; R. Gamliel said that the Shali'ach Tzibur is Yotzei for them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A Beraisa discusses this dispute:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">They asked R. Gamliel:</span> Why the congregation says a silent Amidah beforehand?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">He answered:</span> To give time for the Shali'ach Tzibur to prepare his Amidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">He asked the Rabanan:</span> What is the point of the Shali'ach Tzibur?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">They answered:</span> To be Motzi those who are unable to say the Amidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">He replied:</span> So, too, he can be Motzi those who are able to say it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah citing R. Yochanan):</span> The Rabanan conceded to R. Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The dispute still stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Gemara cites another instance of this debate.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely R. Yochanan has been cited as saying that the Halachah follows R. Gamliel, implying that there is a dispute!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Rabanan only conceded with the prayers of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kipur of Yovel, but the dispute still stands regarding the prayers of the rest of the year.</p>
