<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Every 30 days the prices for wine, oil and flour were fixed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Once Hekdesh has paid for the goods, the suppliers must keep to the price if the price goes up.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the price goes down, the suppliers must discount the goods to Hekdesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Other examples of the advantages given to Hekdesh:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the flour becomes wormy, the supplier must replace it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the wine sours, he must, again, replace it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The money is not his until the items are safely burning on the Mizbeach.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>IN A DIFFERENT BERAISA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>It was taught that (unlike the view of the Mishnah) the merchants received their money immediately, and the Kohanim were Zerizim.</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK #5 EILU HEN HAMEMUNIN</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE TASKS IN THE BEIS HAMIKDASH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>There were 15 tasks in the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Tanna lists the tasks and the people appointed to them.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHO WERE THOSE LISTED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How were <i>these</i> appointees selected by the Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They were the most righteous.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They were of that generation.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE GOOD APPOINTEES AND THE OTHERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Mishnah in Yoma lists the praiseworthy appointees, about which it says, "the memory of the righteous for blessing."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>That Mishnah lists others of whom it says "the name of the evil shall decay."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>According to the opinion that our Mishnah lists highly righteous people then the curse in Yoma must only have applied to the last name in that Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>According to the opinion that our Mishnah lists those in that generation then the blessing applies to Ben Katin.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Others say they were established by the Anshei Keneses ha'Gedolah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If so, R. Akiva established principles and specifics.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Abahu):</span> The Pasuk (Divrei ha'Yamim I 2:55) calls them Sofrim because they counted all similar laws.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Gemara lists examples from each Seder Mishnayos:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Five whose Terumah is not valid, etc.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> Ezra ha'Sofer was called such twice since he counted the letters of the Torah as well as numbering the teachings of Chachamim.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If they were angels, we are people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If they were people, we are donkeys.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa taught that for a Sanhedrin to be called fit, there must be two among them who can speak 70 languages, and all must be able to understand them.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Four entitles that Sanhedrin to the title "wise."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Yavneh had four, as listed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Gemara relates some of the wisdom of Pesachyah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Eretz Yisrael was dry... he interpreted the deaf-mute.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>And again when there was no Omer... he interpreted.</p></div>
