<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> All meat is burned within, even if it became Tamei outside, except for that which was Tamei by an Av ha'Tumah which is burned outside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> All is burned outside except that which was Tamei by a Velad ha'Tumah which is found and burned inside (two leniencies).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> All Av ha'Tumah is burned outside while all Velad ha'Tumah is burned inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Akiva):</span> Everything is burned where it became Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHAT DEFINES AV AND VLAD HATUMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Bar Kaparah):</span> Av ha'Tumah is mid'Oraisa and Velad ha'Tumah is Mi'd'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Both are mid'Oraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yochanan, why does Beis Shamai permit bringing the Vlad HaTumah meat inside?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Further, why does Beis Hillel permit keeping the Vlad HaTumah meat inside?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>These above remain unanswered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Bar Kaparah, Beis Shamai should permit bringing Av HaTumah meat inside, just as it is permitted to leave it within if it became Tamei there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beis Shamai agrees with R. Akiva (and Vlad is permitted to be brought within since it is d'Rabanan).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Bar Kaparah, Beis Hillel should permit bringing the Vlad within!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They hold like R. Shimon (regarding making a Gezeirah to equate d'Rabanan and d'Oreisa Tumah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HALACHAH 4: PLACING THE PARTS OF THE ANIMALS; HEKDESH NOWADAYS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The parts of the Tamid are placed on the western side of the lower half of the ramp</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The parts of the Musafin are on the eastern side.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The parts of Rosh Chodesh Musaf are above them on the Karkov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Shekalim and Bikurim are not practiced without a Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Ma'aser (grain and animals) and firstborn are practiced.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>One who is Makdish Shekalim and Bikurim creates Hekdesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> Bikurin cannot be designated without Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE KARKOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Karkov was located where the Kohanim would walk.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>PRECEDENCE BETWEEN THE MUSAF OF SHABBOS AND ROSH CHODESH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which is brought first, the Musaf of Rosh Chodesh or Shabbos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rosh Chodesh, based on the Shirah, where the Rosh Chodesh was sung first.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosah):</span> Shirah is not applicable since it was sung first to avoid the people's confusion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Rather, the principle of the more regular taking precedence is applicable here, and the Shabbos is offered first.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>MAKING KEDUSHAH WITHOUT A MIKDASH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May we infer that R. Shimon holds that Shekalim <i>may</i> be designated (since he only precluded Bikurim (3.g. above)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (R. Shimon b. Yehudah) R. Shimon holds that Shekalim would also not become Kadosh (unlike the inference from our Mishnah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A convert must designate the funds for his Korbanos (even as he cannot bring them without a Mikdash).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> R. Yochanan b. Zakai annulled that designation because of an impediment.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the impediment?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No Hekdesh can be made for fear of Me'ilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Any Hekdesh (money or animals) designated must be destroyed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>We can prove from the above that even after R. Yochanan b. Zakai eliminated the designation, it still is binding.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We said that the convert who designates his Kinin creates Kedushah (and the money must be destroyed), yet the Beraisa teaches that designated Shekalim are not Kadosh!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Shekalim are tied to Mikdash, and there is no guarantee that they will <i>ever</i> be usable; whereas money set aside for Korbanos will, sooner or later, be usable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Hamnuna and R. Ada b. Ahavah citing Rav):</span> The Halachah is like R. Shimon (of our Mishnah, that Bikurim do not become Kadosh, but coins of Shekalim or the Korban ha'Ger do become Kadosh).</p></div>
