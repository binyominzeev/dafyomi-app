<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HALACHAH 4: TWO ROOMS FOR TZEDAKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>There were two rooms in the Mikdash:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The "quiet" room.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Donations were made there secretly.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Gifts were distributed from there secretly.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The room of utensils.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Donations of Keilim were collected there and surveyed every thirty days.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The ones which are needed for Bedek Ha'Bayis are retained while the rest are sold for the benefit of Bedek Ha'Bayis.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>KEEPING TZEDAKAH SECRET</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>An incident is recorded wherein the Gabai Tzedakah used an intermediary to get Tzedakah to needy, but modest, people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A related incident in which people falsely accused a man of taking Tzedakah which he did not need, only to find after his death that he was secretly distributing these as well as his own funds to Tzedakah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Chinenah would distribute at night and had an encounter with the evil spirits of the night.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>FINDING CLEVER WAYS TO GIVE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yonah):</span> Fortunate is the one who surveys the situation carefully to determine how to give without shaming the recipient.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One approach was to claim that the recipient had inherited funds...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Certain scholars would only accept between Rosh Hashanah and Yom ha'Kipurim (after which they would only rely on their divinely ordained allocation).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>BEWARE WHEN PERFORMING MITZVOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Nechemyah considered the guilt in the death of the poor man to whom he gave meat rather than fowl.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Similarly, Nachum Ish Gamzu who took upon himself enormous affliction in such a case.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva bemoaned seeing him in a such a state.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Nachum wished such a state upon R. Akiva.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Akiva questioned why Nachum should curse him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Nachum questioned R. Akiva's attitude towards earthy affliction (Yisurim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Hoshayah explained to his son's sightless tutor why he had not invited him to dine that particular night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The tutor, when appeased, gave the remarkable blessing to R. Hoshayah: You have appeased one who is seen but does not see; may you be well received by the One Who sees but is not seen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Hoshayah asked him for his source for this wonderful B'rachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>He cited a similar incident regarding R. Eliezer b. Ya'akov.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>SPENDING PRIORITIES (COMPLEX EDIFICES vs TORAH SCHOLARS)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Two accounts are recorded wherein critique is proffered for building great Synagogues and adornments for houses of study at the expense of poor Torah scholars.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">15b----------------------------------------15b</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>PROCEEDS TO BEDEK HA'BAYIS OR TO THE MIZBEACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that items such as animals and stones fitting for the Mizbeach, if donated to Bedek ha'Bayis, may be taken for the needs of the Mizbeach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If the animal was donated to the Mizbeach, its funds may not be used for Bedek ha'Bayis, rather only for the Mizbeach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But our Mishnah, by only mentioning Bedek ha'Bayis, indicates that the funds may <i>not</i> be used for the Mizbeach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both are meant.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that we may only increase the Kedushah of that which was donated, or, the donor was specific, (i.e. for the Heichal) we must retain that level of Kedushah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we see that the Mishnah allows conversions!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The items are sold and the money is recycled into the Lishkas Bedek ha'Bayis as "new" unallocated funds.</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK #6 SHELOSHAH ASAR</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>NUMBERED ITEMS IN THE MIKDASH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>There were 13 Shofaros, 14 Shulchanos, 13 bowings (14 for the house of R. Gamliel).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>There was a tradition that the spot where the wood for the Mizbeach was checked was above the interred Aron ha'Kodesh (and one Kohen paid with his life for this information).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">10)</span><p>THE SHOFAROS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that the Shofaros were narrow at the neck and wider below.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This was to prevent theft/fraud.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">11)</span><p>IS THE ARK INTERRED OR WAS IT EXILED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that the Aron was exiled with them to Bavel (as the Pasuk [Melachim II 20:17] indicates).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Resh Lakish taught that it is hidden in its place (also based on a Pasuk [Divrei ha'Yamim II 5:9]).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Gemara goes on to expound that Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It describes the Badim of the Aron, seen and not seen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rabanan taught that the Aron was hidden below the wood room (as indicated by the incident of the Kohen there, and the manner in which the flame consumed him).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">12)</span><p>MORE ABOUT THE ARON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>There is a dispute regarding the Aron:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> There were two Aronos, one with the Luchos and one with the broken Luchos; the latter going out to battle with the People.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> There was only one Aron, which went out once during the time of Ayli ha'Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Pasuk in Shmuel I (7:8) appears to support the Rabanan (this was a unique event).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Pasuk in Shmuel I (14:18) appears to support R. Yehudah (for how could Shaul have asked for the Aron which was, at the time, in Kiryat Ye'arim?!).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Rabanan respond that Shaul was asking for the Tzitz (i.e. all the Bigdei Kehunah, so that he might inquire of the Urim v'Tumim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The Pasuk in Shmuel II (11:11) appears to support R. Yehudah (refers to the Aron with the people at the battle, not in Tzion, where Dovid ha'Melech had taken it from Kiryat Ye'arim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The Rabanan explain that Uriah meant that the Aron does not have a proper home (Beis ha'Mikdash).</p></div>
