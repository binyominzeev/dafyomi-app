<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>SURPLUS FUNDS OF THE NAZIR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> The surplus is Nedavah if the last Korban he brought was his Chatas; but if it was his Shelamim, then the surplus is Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> The surplus of a Nazir is <i>always</i> Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>There is a Beraisa to support each position:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In support of R. Zeira we learn that even where the funds of Chatas are mixed in with unspecified Nazir funds, the funds remain unspecified (and they are Nedavah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In support of R. Chisda we learn from the silence of the Beraisa which teaches that the remaining funds may be used as Shelamim, <i>not</i> that the balance goes to Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> Surplus funds for the Nazir's Matzos are left to spoil.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi agrees that there is no other option since:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Bread cannot be offered alone nor can another Nazir use it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>It was assumed that the same Din would apply to Nesachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b. R. Bun):</span> As Kodshei Kodshim, Nesachim go to Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Three Amoraim agree that surplus Kodshei Kodshim go to Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HALACHAH 5: ADDITIONAL HALACHOS OF SURPLUS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Surplus of funds designated for redeeming captives is retained for that Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>However if they were designated for a particular captive, the surplus is given to that captive.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The same is true for funds collected for the poor, or for <i>a poor person</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The same for burial funds (the surplus goes to the inheritors).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> The surplus for that deceased await Eliyahu.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Noson):</span> The surplus is used for his tombstone.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SURPLUS FUNDS FOR THE NEEDS OF THE DECEASED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>If funds were collected under the mistaken assumption that the deceased did not have money:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah):</span> They are surplus as in our Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Idi):</span> The donors intended the deceased, not his Yorshim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah):</span> I never taught you such a response!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>In addition to the tombstone, fragrance may be purchased.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SWITCHING FUNDS FROM ONE CAUSE TO ANOTHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Funds may not be changed from one cause to the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Gabbai Tzedakah are permitted to switch the funds, as this was the understanding of the donor.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>MONUMENTS TO THE RIGHTEOUS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>It is not necessary to build monuments to the righteous and their words and deeds are their memorial.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>GREETING ONE'S SENIOR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Yochanan commented to R. Chiya (upon whom he leaned when he walked) that R. Eliezer, from Bavel, conducted himself with two practices.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He does not greet me.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He hides from me.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yakov explained that in Bavel the lesser scholar does not greet the greater one, as per the Pasuk in Iyov (Zeira did not greet Rabah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yakov of R. Yochanan):</span> Is one permitted to walk past an idol.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You do not give it honor by walking past it, nor should you show fear of it by avoiding it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then R. Eliezer has done well in avoiding you!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Yochanan further complained that R. Eliezer does not cite him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Ami and R. Asi related the tragedy which can result from anger over matters in a Beis ha'Medrash.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Yochanan responded that those scholars were peers and should not have been angered, but R. Eliezer is my student!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>R. Yakov b. Idi said that it is <i>understood</i> that R. Eliezer is relating the teachings of his teacher, R. Yochanan, just as it was clear that Yehoshua was relating the teachings of Moshe.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>R. Yochanan was pleased with this response.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was R. Yochanan so anxious that his teachings be cited by name?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Dovid ha'Melech prayed similarly.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He seems to have requested to live forever (!?).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He requested that his prayers (Tehilim) and Halachos endure.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>The lips of the scholar who is cited move in his grave.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Of what benefit is this to the scholar?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Like Konditon or like old wine (see Korban ha'Eidah) whose flavor endures even after it is drunk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>One who cites another should image the cited scholar standing before him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>The Pasuk which refers to one who faithfully recalls the sources of his teaching is R. Zeira.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He said of R. Sheshes (who could not see) that one may not reliably depend on his citations.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Since he is relying on voice identification alone.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Here we see here, and from two other incidents, how careful R. Zeira was regarding citations.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>DOVID HAMELECH AND THE BEIS HAMIKDASH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The scoffers in the generation of Dovid ha'Melech were the worst.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>They would ask him when will the Beis ha'Mikdash be built.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>They did this knowing that it will only be built after Dovid's passing (his son would build it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Dovid was actually pleased with their scorn.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Hash-m told Dovid that He will not shorten Dovid's days since the Tzedakah and Mishpat of Dovid is more precious than the offerings to be brought in the Beis HaMikdash which Shlomo will build.</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK #3 BESHELOSHAH PERAKIM</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>HALACHAH 1: DATES FOR MA'ASER BEHEIMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Three times annually funds would be taken from the Lishkah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>With the arrival of Pesach ("P'ras").</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>With the arrival of Shavuos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>With the arrival of Sukkos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Akiva):</span> The same times are granary dates also used for Ma'aser Beheimah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ben Azai):</span> The dates are 29 Adar, 1 Sivan and 29 Av.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar and R. Shimon):</span> 1 Nisan, 1 Sivan and 29 Elul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did they use 29 Elul (and not 1 Tishrei)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 1 Tishrei is Rosh ha'Shanah, and the markings of the Ma'aser animal cannot be done on that day.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>THE P'RAS OF DAYS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The term "P'ras" always means half (in this case, half of 30 days which are preparatory to the Chag).</p></div>
