<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE MEASURES OF A REVI'IS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Our measure is half of the older measure.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Etzba measure of a Revi'is?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 2x2x1.83 Etzba.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Noson):</span> The measure for carrying dried wine is a KeZayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This aligns with R. Shimon who holds that the Shiur for all liquids is a Revi'is [according to the GR"A, R. Noson aligns with R. Yehudah] (i.e. R. Noson would hold that a k'Zayis of dried wine, were it moist, would be a Revi'is).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HOW MUCH BLOOD OF A NEVEILAH IS METAMEI?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Simon citing R. Yehoshua b. Levi):</span> A donkey of Rebbi died, and they determined the blood which came out of it to be Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Eliezer asked R. Simon until how much blood is Tahor?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Simon did not acknowledge his question.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Eliezer then asked R. Yehoshua b. Levi who responded until a Revi'is.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Simon's lack of response bothered R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>When questioned regarding the status of more than a Revi'is, R. Bibi (seemingly in anger) would not acknowledge the question.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>When asked why he refused the question, he said that his poverty (having to buy bread from the baker) caused him to be unsettled and thus unable to properly respond.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> And what, indeed, is the Halachah regarding a Revi'is of blood from a Neveilah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua b. Pesura testified):</span> It is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rebuttal:</span> No, it is not a Machshir, but it is Metamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we were taught in a Mishnah that only the blood of a Sheretz has this quality (Tamei but not Machshir)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Its uniqueness is its <i>amount</i> (the measure for its blood being equal to the measure of its flesh - k'Adashah) not the quality of Tamei but not Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> There is a Machlokes Amoraim regarding the blood of a Neveilah (one says Tamei and one says Tahor).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The one who says Tamei aligns with R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The one who says Tahor aligns with R. Yehoshua b. Pesura.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avduma):</span> It is correct to say that R. Yehudah maintains that the blood of Neveilah is Tamei since he was the Posek in the house of Rebbi (and he said that more than a Revi'is is Tamei).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID SUSPICION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One with much hair (or, one who is poor - Rambam) must not extract the funds (to avoid suspicion).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The treasurers would separate the hairs of their wool garments.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Conversation would be maintained with those doing the work throughout the Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Let him fill his mouth with water?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He cannot, on account of the Berachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The obligation to be Yotzei in the eyes of people (just as one must be Yotzei in the eyes of Heaven) is found in the Torah, Nevi'im and Kesuvim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Torah - V'hiyisem Neki'im... (Bamidbar 32:22)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Nevi'im - E-l E-lohim Hash-m... (Yehoshua 22)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Kesuvim - Umetzah Chen... (Mishlei 3:4)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>The Pasuk in the Torah is the most explicit.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>HALACHAH 3: PROCEDURES FOR THE TERUMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The members of R. Gamliel's family would enter and insure that their coins would be part of the Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The one taking the Terumah would ask three times, and be instructed, in response, three times, to take the Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>After taking Terumah, the Shirayim were covered (the first and second time, not the third, since there is no concern for mixing the Shirayim with incoming Shekalim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The first Terumah consisted of coins from Eretz Yisrael, the second from the adjacent cities and the third (Sukos) was from the distant countries.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">9b----------------------------------------9b</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE CUSTOM OF THE HOUSE OF R. GAMLIEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But any Terumah accounts for the entire amount it exempts (why should they care if it is <i>their</i> coins)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It gave them comfort knowing that their coins were used for the Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>After the Sukos Terumah the covers were removed (and the Shirayim allowed to mingle).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The third Terumah was the richest of them all (owing to the gold coins which represented the Shekalim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Each of the three Terumos were donated with intent to include all of Klal Yisrael (i.e. those who <i>will</i> yet donate).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>USING THE FUNDS IN THE BOXES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>They would begin using the first box and immediately begin using the second and then the third.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Only after emptying the third would they move back to empty the second and then the first.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>When the funds were spent a new Terumah of Shekalim was raised.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> They could go back to take from the Shirayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>He held that there is still Me'ilah in the Shirayim since they might be needed as above.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>BEHAVIOR BEYOND REPROACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Pinchas b. Yair taught the succession of the acquisition of proper character traits [Zerizus brings one to Nekiyus, which brings one to Taharah, etc.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A Pasuk is brought to support each of the levels described above.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>(In the name of R. Meir) One who resides in Eretz Yisrael, speaks Lashon ha'Kodesh and recited Kerias Shema twice daily will be given the tidings that he is a Ben Olam ha'Ba.</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK #4 HATERUMAH</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>HALACHAH 1: HOW WERE THE TERUMAH FUNDS ALLOCATED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>They would purchase all of the Korbanos Tzibur (including the Ketores) with the Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>They would pay the watchmen who protected the Sefichin during Shemitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> One could volunteer his services as a watchman.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> He may not volunteer as the Korbanos must be entirely owned by the public.</p></div>
