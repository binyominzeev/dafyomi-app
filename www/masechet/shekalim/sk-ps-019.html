<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>HALACHAH 1: DEALING WITH FOUND MONEY BETWEEN THE KUPOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Mishnah instructs how to deal with money found between the Kupos of Shekalim-Nedavah, Eitzim-Levonah, Kinin-Gozelei Olah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We assume that the funds originated in the closer place, even to be lenient.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>When neither source is closer, we attribute the funds to the more stringent place of origin.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ANALYZING DOUBTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But only the Shekalim-Kinim Kupos were next to one-another (creating the doubt), not Shekalim-Nedavah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Kupos were not in line, they were in a circle.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do the equidistant funds go to Nedavah (since Shekalim are more stringent)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The money may end up as Shirayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Fifty-fifty doubt is likened to a Korban whose owners died (and as Shekalim they would also go to Nedavah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yasa reported having heard (in Bavel) R. Yehudah ask this question of Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Shmuel had taught that Shekalim (in the case where the owner designated the funds and then died) should go to Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>LEFTOVER FUNDS FROM THE MINCHAS KOHEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The leftover funds must be destroyed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> They go to Nedavah (as leftover Chatas).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>KININ-GOZELOS EQUIDISTANT GOES TO GOZELOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can a Chatas be brought as an Olah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a T'nai Beis Din.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How are this woman's Korban needs addressed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This, too, is a T'nai Beis Din (with the supplier).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why weren't other combinations mentioned in the Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> These were addressed by the general principle at the end of the Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>HALACHAH 2: DEALING WITH OTHER FINDS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Mishnah deals with money found in various parts of Yerushalayim and beyond regarding their Ma'aser status.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Mishnah deals with found meat regarding the question of it being Neveilah or Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Even when the meat of Korbanos might be valid, it cannot be eaten, but it must be retained until it is certainly invalid, and then burnt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The manner in which the meat is cut will indicate its origin.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>MONEY ON HAR HA'BAYIS IS CHULIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Could the money not be from Hekdesh (Shekalim)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is a Chazakah that the Kohen would not take money out of the Lishkah before redeeming it on an animal.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>THE INVALIDATION OF HESECH HADA'AS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer citing R. Hoshayah):</span> Meat which became invalidated through Hesech ha'Da'as must develop an additional invalidation before being burned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Our Mishnah (which says that it must develop an additional invalidation and is then burned) is cited as a support for the above.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> The Law of the Mishnah is (not because of Hesech ha'Da'as, but rather) because of our doubts if the meat has already become invalid (Nosar).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">([The above step according to the GR"A] R. Yosi):</span> Such doubtful meat should be Tahor (as with any doubt in Reshus HaRabim), but the reason for burning this meat is we cannot eat it (since it may already be invalid) and we may not burn it (since it may not be invalid).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>MEAT WHICH IS FOUND DEPENDS ON ITS CUT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Krispa citing R. Yosi b. Chaninah):</span> Whole limbs are definitely Neveilah, and one would get Malkos for eating them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This seems supported by our Mishnah which speaks in definite terms (permitted-completely, Neveilah-even with Malkos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>(Same source as (a) above) Whole limbs which are tied together are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>SITUATIONS OF DOUBT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A person is in doubt regarding the meat he bought in one of ten stores (nine sell Neveilah and 1 sells Kosher) - it is presumed not Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he found meat in such a town, we follow the majority (non-Kosher)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Even if (in case (a) above) the nine stores sell Kosher, it is presumed non-Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If he found meat in such a town, we follow the majority (Kosher).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>(R. Yochanan) If the meat were found in the hands of a Gentile, it is the same as in the markets above.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Mana pointed out an incident which, he said, indicated against R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Yochanan restricted his law to a case where we saw the Gentile merchant leaving the store of a Jew.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">10)</span><p>MEAT BOUGHT BY A GENTILE FROM A JEW</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>An incident is recorded where a Jew bought meat through a Gentile from another Jew and it turned out to be Neveilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rebbi taught that this one case cannot prohibit all of the butcher shops in town.</p></div>
