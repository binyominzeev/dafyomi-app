<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ACCEPTING COMMUNAL OFFERINGS FROM INDIVIDUALS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Mishnah in Ta'anis (26a) teaches that there were certain families whose donated wood would be used for the Ma'arachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Gemara reviews the history of these generous families who addressed the lack of wood in the Lishkah at the beginning of the Bayis Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They were granted, by the Nevi'im of that time, the privilege of having their wood used on the day of their offering even when the Lishkah is full of wood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Acha):</span> That Mishnah must follow the opinion of R. Yosi in our Mishnah that an individual may volunteer as the watchman.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ila):</span> That Mishnah may follow all opinions, since there is no argument regarding preparatory components of the offerings, only regarding the offerings themselves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>A Beraisa teaches that a woman may make a white Kesones for the Avodah, provided that she donates it entirely to the public.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Acha):</span> That Beraisa is R. Yosi (as in (b) above).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ila):</span> It is all opinions (as in (c) above).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>A Beraisa seems to indicate that the Mishnah of the donated wood does <i>not</i> exclusively follow R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that (according to Chachamim) the festival of those donor families continued beyond the Churban.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi maintains that it was only during the period when offerings were being brought.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Chachamim (and <i>not only</i> R. Yosi) accept the principle of accepting communal offerings from individuals.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE OMER IS LOCAL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches (Menachos 83b) that, unlike all other public and private Korbanos, the Omer must be brought only from Chadash and only from Eretz Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is the opinion of R. Yishmael, namely, that the Omer may not be brought from Chutz la'Aretz (even from Suria, which has some of Kedushas ha'Aretz).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>We are taught that in a Beraisa that the Omer, Bikurim and Sh'tei ha'Lechem are brought exclusively from Eretz Yisrael, an indication of its superior Kedushah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>This, too, is the opinion of R. Yishmael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yishmael taught that the cutting of the Omer overrides Shabbos (and is consistent with his opinion that the Omer may not be brought from Suria, because if it could come from a distance it would surely have to be done before Shabbos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>In a related point, it is R. Yishmael who holds (in our Mishnah) that a watchman must guard the (otherwise prohibited) Sefichim in Eretz Yisrael in order not to bring the Omer from Chutz la'Aretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yusa):</span> No, the permission to watch the Sefichim is the opinion of all, and it was done only as a backup in the event the grain could not be found in Chutz la'Aretz.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>PLANTING OMER DURING SHEMITAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would it be permitted to plant grain during Shemitah to cover in the even Sefichim could not be found?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must be Asur since it would create a Kometz being offered where the Shirayim do not become permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we are asking if the Omer would be like those five Korbanos which <i>are</i> offered but not eaten!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>PAYING THE WATCHMEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the procedure for paying the watchmen?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are 4 steps:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The funds are borrowed from a Shulchani.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The watchmen are paid in full before the Omer is brought.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Funds are then taken from the Lishkah and their Kedushah is Mechulal on the grains received from the watchmen.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Those funds are then given to the Shulchani.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that can't work (two approaches: 1. because since the grains are worth much less than the salaries of the watchmen; or, 2. since so much of the grains is discarded it is not appropriate to be Mechalel the Kodesh funds on them)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This was already accounted for in the setting of the original price for the grain with the watchmen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The stonecutters received their pay with the same steps (as in (b) above), with the same concern (as in (c) above) and the same response (as in (d) above).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chananyah):</span> The surplus Nesachim went to Kayitz ha'Mizbeach and the remaining Kupah funds went for K'lei Shares.</p></div>
