<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In one Beraisa we learn that the Minchah coming from communal funds is d'Oreisa, and our Mishnah teaches that it is a condition of Beis Din!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> D'Oreisa it comes from the Tzibur, and the condition was to allow the funds of the Terumas ha'Lishka to be used.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is the Minchah in such a case whole in both the morning and evening (two Esronim) or only in the morning?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both must be whole.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What about the three Lugin of oil?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Levonah, too, was a question of R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Is it a full Kometz with each Isaron, or half?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the Kometz is derived from the Lechem ha'Panim, it requires two full Komatzim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Once we learn the Kometz from Lechem ha'Panim, we should do the same for the three Lugin of oil!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>And the ultimate source for the three Lugin is Minchas Chavitin, hence;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We should require three full Lugin.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ME'ILAH BY THE EIFER HAPARAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah implies that mid'Oraisa there <i>is</i> Me'ilah (and the condition of Beis Din removed it), yet the Beraisa teaches that mid'Oraisa there is <i>no</i> Me'ilah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is no Me'ilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>People were treating the Eifer lightly.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chazal made their Gezeirah (Me'ilah).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> They are all Tehorim except for the utensils used specifically for graves.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Simon citing R. Yehoshua b. Levi):</span> A donkey of Rebbi died, and they determined the blood which came out of it to be Tahor.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Simon's lack of response bothered R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>When questioned regarding the status of more than a Revi'is, R. Bibi (seemingly in anger) would not acknowledge the question.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>When asked why he refused the question, he said that his poverty (having to buy bread from the baker) caused him to be unsettled and thus unable to properly respond.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> And what, indeed, is the Halachah regarding a Revi'is of blood from a Neveilah?</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Its uniqueness is its <i>amount</i> (the measure for its blood being equal to the measure of its flesh - K'Adashah) not the quality of Tamei but not Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> There is a Machlokes Amoraim regarding the blood of a Neveilah (one says Tamei and one says Tahor).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avduma):</span> It is correct to say that R. Yehudah maintains that the blood of Neveilah is Tamei since he was the Posek in the house of Rebbi (and he said that more than a Revi'is is Tamei).</p></div>
