<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>PUBLIC NEEDS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa (dealing with Chol ha'Moed) offers an expanded list of public needs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Other Halachos of Chol ha'Moed are included in the Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If these (e.g. irrigating or marking graves) were done on the 15th of Adar, why are they repeated on Chol ha'Moed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There were torrential rains which washed them out.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do the agents of Beis Din need to go out, again, on the first of Nisan, regarding Kilayim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The crops were not then recognizable.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>GRAVE MARKERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence the requirement to mark graves?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Pasuk in Vayikra implies that the Tumah must 'call out.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Pasuk in Yechezkel specifically refers to such markers.  (The references in the Pasuk are fully expounded:)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Etzem... Even bones without flesh must be marked.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Adam... Skull and spine.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Uvana... Marking fixed stones (since rolling stones can lead to false Tumah in their new place).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Etzlo... Mark the grave in a (proximate) Tahor place.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Tziyun... The obligation to mark graves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If one hovers directly above a single marked stone he is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If there are <i>two</i> marked stones the area <i>between</i> is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If the intervening space has been plowed, then the two stones are considered as separate (and the intervening space is Tahor).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>We do not mark the place where flesh is found.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This operates with the assumption that the flesh will decompose to less than a KeZayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But in the meantime the Taharos will be Tamei!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The marking would create indefinite time of Tumah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE ERADICATION OF KILAYIM OVER TIME</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>(R. Yehudah) Originally, the found Kilayim was tossed in the field.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>When unscrupulous people increased, they tossed it on the road.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Eventually, the Beis Din made the whole field Hefker.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>HEFKER BEIS DIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa explains the rationale for the increasing stringency of the Mishnah (i.e. the unscrupulous kept on being pleased with the eradication work done by the agents).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Making the field ownerless employs Hefker Beis Din Hefker.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence that Hefker Beis Din Hefker?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We see that Ezra employed Hefker Beis Din.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that such Hefker is exempt from Ma'aser?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It can be seen in the Mishnah which restricts making a leap year of a Shemitah (or post-Shemitah) year (however, the produce of such an added month would be exempt from Maaser).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not add to a post-Shemitah year?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Not to increase the prohibition of Chadash.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The restriction of the Mishnah only applies until Rebbi permitted vegetables brought from Chutz la'Aretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The Beraisa taught that now that the years not ke'Takanan, adding a month is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>The Beis Din of R. Gamliel made the eighth year a leap year.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The <i>Torah</i> obligates us to make a leap year (in order to keep Nisan in the Spring), so an added month (even in a Shemitah year) is truly part of the year, and this Mishnah does not prove Hefker Beis Din!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is learned from the Din of one who placed his Gadish on top of Leket.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even Beis Hillel (who obligate the poor to take Maaser from that which was Hefker only for them) would agree that the bottom layer of such a pile is exempt from Maaseros.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This shows that the penalty imposed on such a person by Beis Din does, indeed, make it ownerless.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>From the 15th of Adar the money changers set up their shops.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>From the 25th of Adar they opened where they were even more accessible to the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>From that point they would also begin to extract securities from the homes of the delinquents.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The securities were extracted (even from) the Leviim, Yisraelim, converts, but not from women, Avadim, nor minors.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Once a father begins to give the half-Shekel on behalf of a minor, he must continue to do so each year.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> Reported that any Kohen who donates is permitted to do so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan b. Zakai):</span> He is obligated (they <i>erroneously</i> inferred from the Pasuk that they must not participate in the Korbanos).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>We do not take security from minors, but we do demand the Shekel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This must refer to a minor who has shown signs of maturity.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>We do not demand of a younger minor (but a security is taken only from an older age). [There are two versions of the above steps; the second version reads that the obligation starts at age 20.]</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Chachamim would respond to R. Yehudah by pointing out that a Korban Tzibur is not put to death.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>They, in turn, respond that once it is turned over to the Tzibur it is reckoned as a Minchas Tzibur.</p></div>
