<p class=newsubject><span class=numt>1)</span> WHERE THE KOHANIM GUARD</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(a)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah):</span> Kohanim guard in three places in the Beis ha'Mikdash -- in Beis Avtinas, Beis ha'Nitzutz, and Beis ha'Moked.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(b)</span>	There were Aliyos (upper stories) in Beis Avtinas and Beis ha'Nitzutz. Rovim (young Kohanim) would guard there;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	Beis ha'Moked was built like a dome. It was a big house, with stone Rovdim (this will be explained) jutting out all around. The elders of the Beis Av (the sub-division of Kohanim scheduled to serve the next day) would sleep there, with the keys to the Azarah in their hands;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span>	Pirchei (young) Kohanim would sleep on the floor (Rosh - with pillows under their heads);</p>
<p class=thirdindent><span class=numl3>i.</span>	They would not sleep in Bigdei Kehunah. They would fold them under their heads and sleep in Chulin garments.</p>
