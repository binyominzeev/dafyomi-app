<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WARNING ONE'S WIFE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> One who is Mekanei (warns his wife not to be secluded) must do so in front of two witnesses. He can be Mashkeh her (force her to drink Sotah water, or forfeit her Kesuvah) if he or one witness saw her in seclusion;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehoshua says, Kinuy is in front of two witnesses. Two witnesses of seclusion are needed for Hashka'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>What constitutes warning? If he told her in front of two witnesses 'do not speak with Ploni', and she spoke with Ploni, she does not become forbidden to her husband or to eat Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she was secluded with Ploni for the time needed for Bi'ah, she is forbidden to her husband and to Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If her husband died later (without children), she does Chalitzah. She may not do Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does tractate Sotah follow Nazir?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like Rebbi taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> The Torah discusses Nazir after Sotah, to teach that anyone who sees a Sotah in her disgrace should become a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Sotah should precede Nazir!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perek ha'Madir (which discusses vows) is in Tractate Kesuvos, therefore Nedarim follows Kesuvos. Nazir is like a Neder, so it comes next. Sotah follows, for Rebbi's reason.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>'One who is Mekanei' connotes that this should not be done.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Our Tana holds that it is forbidden to warn one's wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Hash-m arranges matches so that a man always gets a woman commensurate with his deeds - "a Rasha (an evil wife) will not rule over Tzadikim"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Arranging matches is harder than Keri'as Yam Suf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Reish Lakish):</span> Rav Yehudah taught that 40 days before a fetus is formed, a voice from Heaven announces whose daughter is for him to marry, and which house and field are for him! (Rashi - it is not decreed if they will be Tzadikim or Resha'im, this is up to their free choice!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yehudah's teaching applies to one's initial match. Reish Lakish discusses a second match.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE WITNESS SUFFICES FOR <i>TUM'AH</i></p><i>
</i><p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> Two witnesses are needed to warn...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Tana'im argue only about seclusion, but agree that one witness is believed to say that she had Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> If one witness saw that she had Bi'ah, she does not drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the Torah believes one witness to say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "V'Ed Ein Bah (and she was not forced)" - there are not two witnesses (about Tum'ah, only one, and she is forbidden)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it means that not even one witness knows about her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "One witness will not rise against a man."</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already know that the verse discusses one witness, for "Yakum" (rise) is singular. Why did the Torah specify "one"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that everywhere in the Torah "Ed" refers to two witnesses, unless the Torah specifies 'one,'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Summation of answer:</span> The Torah said that there are not two witnesses, only one, and if she was not forced, she is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If not for "one witness will not rise", we would have said (c:1) that there is not even one witness of Tum'ah. If so, how would she become forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If not for "one witness will not rise", we would have explained "V'Ed Ein Bah" to mean that one witness is not believed to say that she had Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If we required two witnesses about Tum'ah, the Torah would not have written anything here, and we would learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Davar-Davar" from monetary cases that we require two witnesses, like all testimony! (Regarding adultery it says "Ki Matza Vah Ervas Davar.")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Sotah is different;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since there are grounds to believe that she had Bi'ah, i.e. he warned her and she was secluded, one would have thought that even one witness about Tum'ah is believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> How could we have thought that the verse teaches that one witness of Tum'ah is not believed and she is permitted? It says "she was not forced", i.e. she is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We would have thought that one witness about Tum'ah is not believed, and she is permitted, unless two witnesses testify about her. And even when two testify, they must say that she was not forced, or else she remains permitted.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW MANY WITNESSES ARE NEEDED FOR WARNING AND SECLUSION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yehoshua says, he warns her in front of two witnesses...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehoshua's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "(There is no witness) about her (Tum'ah, i.e. adultery)" - about her (Tum'ah one witness suffices) but not about her warning, and not about her seclusion (for these, two witnesses are required).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer expounds "about her (Tum'ah, one witness suffices), but not about her warning (this requires two witnesses).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't he (also) expound, about her (Tum'ah), and not about her seclusion?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Seclusion is equated to Tum'ah (for which one witness suffices) - "she was secluded, and became Temei'ah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Warning is also equated to Tum'ah - "he warned his wife, and she became Temei'ah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah taught that one witness is not enough for warning - "about her" (Tum'ah, but not about her warning).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we equate seclusion to Tum'ah, and exclude warning, and not vice-versa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Presumably, seclusion is more severe, for it forbids her (to her husband and Terumah), like Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> No, warning is more severe, for through warning, seclusion forbids her!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Neither is more severe, for warning without seclusion does nothing, and seclusion without warning is meaningless.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Seclusion is more severe, for it is the start of Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Our Mishnah is unlike the following Tana.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah, citing R. Eliezer):</span> One warns his wife in front of one witness, or by himself. Two witnesses of seclusion are needed to obligate her to drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> If so, there is no end! (This will be explained.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yosi's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "About her (Tum'ah)", and not about her seclusion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't he (also) expound 'about her (Tum'ah), and not about her warning'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Warning is equated to Tum'ah - "he warned his wife, and she became Temei'ah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Seclusion is also equated to Tum'ah - "she was secluded and became Temei'ah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That teaches that the duration of time for seclusion is the time needed for Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chachamim):</span> If so, there is no end!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He can lie, and say that he warned her when he really didn't.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> (This is difficult for R. Eliezer according to R. Yosi, but according to R. Eliezer's opinion) in the Mishnah, he cannot make her drink through lying.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> He can falsely claim that she was in seclusion! (In the Mishnah, R. Eliezer does not require witnesses of seclusion.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> Chachamim said 'even' according to (you,) R. Yosi, there is no end.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> 'Even' connotes that all the more so, according to the Mishnah there is no end.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> To the contrary! According to the Mishnah, the basis (warning) must be true. According to R. Yosi, he can lie about the basis!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Correction (R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> Rather, (according to R. Eliezer) according to R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah, and even according to the Mishnah, there is no end.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina from Sura):</span> Nowadays, one should not tell his wife not to be secluded with a particular man.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps the Halachah follows R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah, that he can warn her alone. If she is secluded with him, since she cannot drink, she becomes forbidden forever!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE MEANING OF <i>KINUY</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> What does Kinuy (warning) mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> It is something that brings enmity between her and others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that the husband can warn her himself. She will avoid seclusion with the men she was warned about. They will not know about the warning, and will resent this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yemar bar R. Shalmiya):</span> It is something that brings enmity between him and his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that warning must be in front of two witnesses. Others will know of the warning (and will not resent her). She will resent her husband's suspicion of her, and will quarrel with him.</p>
