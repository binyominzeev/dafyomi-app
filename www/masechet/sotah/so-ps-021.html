<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MERIT SUSPENDS PUNISHMENT (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is like R. Yishmael. Another verse shows that Hash-m's can delay three times as long;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Hash-m said, I will not punish until three transgressions of Edom."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did R. Yishmael say this is not a proof?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps Hash-m is slower to punish Nochrim. (He allows them to sin until they deserve destruction.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Some merit can suspend for three years...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which merit is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot be merit of Torah. A woman is not commanded!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is the merit of Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The merit of Mitzvos does not protect so much!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Menachem bar Yosi):</span> "For a Mitzvah is (like) a lamp, and Torah is light" - just like a lamp illuminates only temporarily, a Mitzvah protects only temporarily;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like light always illuminates, Torah always protects.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"When you walk, it (Torah) will give you to rest" - in this world;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"When you lie down, it will guard you" - in death;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>"When you wake up, it will advocate for you" - in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A parable for this is a man walking in the black of the night. He fears thorns, pits, wild beasts, and robbers. Also, he does not know on which path he is walking.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he gets a torch, this saves him from thorns and pits. He still fears wild beasts and robbers; and does not know on which path he is walking;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>When dawn comes, he is saved from wild beasts and robbers, but he still does not know on which path he is walking;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>When he gets to the crossroads, he is saved from all his concerns.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"Great waters cannot extinguish the love" - a sin can inhibit the reward for a Mitzvah, but not the reward for Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> A Mitzvah protects (from punishment) and saves (from sin) when one is doing it. Afterwards, it protects, but does not save;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Torah protects and saves, even when not engaging in it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Doeg and Achitofel engaged in Torah, but it didn't save them from sin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rather, Torah protects and saves when engaging in it. When not engaging in it, it only protects;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Mitzvah protects but does not save, both when doing the Mitzvah and when not doing it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (e) - Ravina):</span> Really, the merit of Torah can give a woman three years;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though she is not commanded to learn, since she brings her sons to learn Chumash and Mishnah, and misses her husband when he is learning, she shares in their reward.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the parable, what does the crossroads symbolize?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> It is a Chacham who comes to the day of his death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It is a Chacham who obtains fear of sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Mar Zutra):</span> It is a Chacham whose words are accepted to be the Halachah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CAN ONE LOSE THE REWARD FOR TORAH AND MITZVOS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa (above)):</span> A sin can inhibit the reward for a Mitzvah, but not the reward for Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> R. Menachem bar Yosi expounded the verses as if he received them on Har Sinai! Had Doeg and Achitofel expounded thusly, they would not have sought the downfall of David;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"They say 'Hashem has abandoned him.'"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did they think so?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Hash-m will not see in you a matter of sexual immorality, lest He turn away from you";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They did not realize that a sin can inhibit the reward for a Mitzvah, but not the reward for (David's) Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "Boz Yavuzu Lo (they will scorn him)"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> This does not refer to Shimon, the brother of Azaryah (he was called so, for his brother supported him); nor R. Yochanan, (who was supported by the Nasi). Rather, it refers to Hillel and Shevna.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> Hillel and Shevna were brothers; Hillel engaged in Torah, Shevna in business.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Shevna:</span> Let us be partners, and split the rewards (in this and the next worlds).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">A voice from Heaven:</span> "If a man would give all his wealth for love (Torah learning), they will scorn him." (Magen Avos (1:14) - Shevna is scorned, for he did not offer to support Hillel before he learned. R. Yerucham (Toldos Adam v'Chavah 2:5 - if one tried to sell the reward for what he already learned, he loses it (and will be scorned). Maharsha - Shimon and R. Yochanan were scorned in this world (they were called by the name of their supporters) and the next (they lost half the reward for their learning). The Maharsha explains Ula to teach that one should not do like Shimon or R. Yochanan. Rather, he should refuse, like Hillel.)</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TEACHING TORAH TO WOMEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Ben Azai):</span> A man is obligated to teach... R. Eliezer says, one who teaches his daughter Torah teaches her Tiflus (folly, or promiscuity).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> You cannot say that he teaches her Tiflus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, it is as if he teaches her Tiflus. (Rambam - she will not understand it properly. Rashi - she will learn how to conceal her deeds.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> R. Eliezer learns from "I (the Torah) am Chachmah, my neighbor is Ormah (craftiness)" - once a person learns Chachmah, craftiness enters him. (This is bad for a woman. She is easily swayed, perhaps she will use it for sin.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim expound the verse like R. Yosi bar Chanina.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> "I am Chachmah, my neighbor is Ormah (related to the word Arum - naked)" - Torah endures only in one who strips himself (of possessions).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Torah endures only in one who makes himself like nothing - "Chachmah me'Ayin (from where - the word may be read 'from nothing') will be found.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehoshua):</span> A woman prefers one Kav...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A woman prefers one Kav (of food, i.e. sparse rations) and frequent Bi'ah with her husband, to nine Kabim and abstention. (Rashi - since she disdains abstention, it is not good to teach Torah to her. Tosfos - normally, one gives to his wife two Kabim of wheat per week (Kesuvos 64b). One who forbids Bi'ah through a vow adds three Zuz to her Kesuvah each week, which can be used to buy 18 Kabim. She prefers the former.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THOSE WHO DESTROY THE WORLD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehoshua):</span> A foolish Chasid...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is an example of a foolish Chasid?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When a woman is drowning in the river, he will not save her, to avoid looking at a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is an example of a crafty Rasha?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> He presents his case to the judge before his opponent comes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Avahu):</span> He gives one Zuz to a Oni (poor person), so that the Oni will now have 200 Zuz;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who has 200 Zuz may not take agricultural gifts for the poor, i.e. dropped sheaves, forgotten produce, the unharvested corner of the field, and the tithe for the poor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who has 199 Zuz may accept gifts for the poor, even if 1000 people give to him at once.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Asi):</span> He counsels sons to sell a small estate (i.e. insufficient to feed all the orphans until the girls grow up. It should be used to feed the daughters);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> If sons sold a small estate, the sale stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Abaye):</span> He counsels to sell property received on condition (that another will receive what remains), like R. Shimon ben Gamliel's law:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If one said 'I give my property to Reuven. After him, it should go to Ploni', and Reuven sold it, Ploni takes it from the buyers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, Ploni receives only what Reuven leaves over when he dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rav Yosef bar Chama):</span> He persuades others to go in his (evil) ways.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #6 (R. Zerika):</span> He is lenient for himself and stringent for others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #7 (Ula):</span> He learned written Torah and Mishnah, but not the reasons behind the Mishnayos and resolutions of their difficulties. (He is a Rasha, because it sounds like he knows and people honor him, but really one may not rely on him.)</p>
