<p class="dedicationbox">12th CYCLE DEDICATION<br>SOTAH 26-28 - A week of study material has been dedicated by Mrs. Rita Grunberger of Queens, N.Y., in loving memory of her husband, Reb Yitzchok Yakov (Irving) ben Eliyahu Grunberger. Irving Grunberger helped many people quietly in an unassuming manner and is dearly missed by all who knew him. His Yahrzeit is 10 Sivan. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE <i>BO'EL</i> IS ALSO CHECKED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The Mishnah says that the water also checks him. To whom does this refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It checks her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He did not sin. Why should he be punished?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he is punished if he transgressed (he had Bi'ah with her after seclusion).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the water would not check her!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "The man will be clean from sin, and she will bear her sin" - the water checks her only if her husband is clean from sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it also checks the Bo'el.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't the Mishnah say so explicitly, like in the Seifa 'just like she is forbidden to her husband, she is forbidden to the Bo'el'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the Reisha, since it says 'the water checks her', it says 'him' for parallel structure. In the Seifa, since it says 'she is forbidden to her husband', it says 'the Bo'el.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It says "and (the water) will come, and will come."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the Tana expound only the superfluous 'and', or the entire word "u'Va'u (and will come)"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> Just like she is forbidden to her husband, she is forbidden to the Bo'el - "she was defiled", "and she was defiled."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> There also, it is not clear. Does the Tana expound the superfluous 'and', or the entire word?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah - Rebbi):</span> It says "she was defiled" twice. This teaches that she is forbidden to her husband and the Bo'el;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This implies that R. Akiva expounds the superfluous 'and.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>It says 'and will come' three times. R. Akiva expounds superfluous 'and's, so he learn six things!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m commands the water to enter the Sotah to test her; also, He commands that it test him (the Bo'el);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Torah discusses giving the Sotah to drink. It is as if also he drinks;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Torah informs how she will die. This applies also to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rebbi (does not expound superfluous 'and's, so he) learns only three things. How does Rebbi learn that just like the water checks her, it also checks him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "To make the stomach swell and the thigh fall" refers to the stomach and thigh of the Bo'el.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it refers to the stomach and thigh of the Sotah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah previously said that her stomach and thigh will be stricken.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva says, the repetition is to make known the order in which the limbs will be stricken, lest people will not say that the water does not work as predicted in the curse.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> If so, the Torah should have said 'her stomach and her thigh.' It said generically "stomach and thigh" to teach that the Bo'el is also tested.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this is all that we may learn from the verse!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, the Torah should have said 'his stomach and his thigh.' It said generically "stomach and thigh" to teach both (that the Bo'el is also tested, and the order in which the limbs are stricken).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SHE IS ALSO FORBIDDEN TO THE <i>BO'EL</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehoshua):</span> Zecharyah ben ha'Katzav also expounded this way...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> It says three times "if she was defiled", "she was defiled", and "and she was defiled", to teach that she becomes forbidden to her husband, the Bo'el, and Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> No verse is needed to forbid her to Kehunah. We may learn a Kal va'Chomer from Terumah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A divorcee may eat Terumah, but she is forbidden to Kehunah. A Sotah is forbidden to Terumah, all the more so she is forbidden to Kehunah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "she was defiled" and "she was not defiled"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she was (surely) defiled, why does she drink?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she was (surely) not defiled, why does her husband make her drink?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah teaches that even though it is a Safek, she is forbidden as if she was definitely defiled until she drinks).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>From here we learn to Safek Tum'ah, e.g. of a rodent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Torah does not forbid a Sotah if she sinned unknowingly or was forced, only if she sinned knowingly and willingly. Still, a Safek is forbidden as if she were surely Temei'ah (defiled);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A rodent is Metamei knowingly or unknowingly, willingly or unwillingly. All the more so, a Safek is forbidden as if it were surely Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">28b----------------------------------------28b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The source of the Kal va'Chomer, Sotah, is a Safek in a Reshus ha'Yachid (less than three people were there). We may learn only to Safek Tum'ah involving a rodent in a Reshus ha'Yachid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Sotah is a Safek in which an involved party has understanding. We may learn only to Safek Tum'ah involving a rodent in which an involved party has understanding.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim derived from here that Safek Tum'ah in which an involved party has understanding is Tamei in a Reshus ha'Yachid. In a Reshus ha'Rabim, it is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Safek Tum'ah in which no involved party has understanding, whether in a Reshus ha'Yachid or a Reshus ha'Rabim, is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SHE IS FORBIDDEN TO <i>TERUMAH</i> AND <i>KEHUNAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> R. Akiva expounded a verse to teach that she is disqualified from Terumah. Why did R. Yishmael answer that no verse is needed to teach that she is disqualified from Kehunah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> How does R. Akiva learn that she is disqualified from Kehunah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> No verse is needed. Regarding her husband, the Torah considers her to be a Vadai (definite) Zonah (adulteress). Also regarding Kehunah, she is considered a Vadai Zonah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If she were a Zonah regarding Kehunah, she would also be a Zonah regarding Terumah. R. Akiva learned Terumah from a verse!</p>
