<p class="dedicationbox">SOTAH 33 (16 Kislev) - Today's Daf has been dedicated in honor of the Yahrzeit of Reb Moshe ben Eliyahu Feinberg by his daughter Libi. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WAS THE TORAH GIVEN IN ALL LANGUAGES?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rebbi holds that the Torah was given (to be read) in all languages.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he held that it was given only in Hebrew, Rebbi would not need "they will be" to teach that Shema Yisrael must be read in Hebrew!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is no proof. Perhaps it was given only in Hebrew, but if not for "they will be", one might have thought that "Shema" allows any language.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Chachamim hold that the Torah was given only in Hebrew.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they held that it was given in all languages, they would not need to learn from "Shema" to allow Shema in any language!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is no proof. Perhaps it was given in all languages, but if not for "Shema", one might have thought that "they will be" obligates Hebrew.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OTHER THINGS THAT MAY BE DONE IN ANY LANGUAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Prayer (may be said in any language).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since it is a request for mercy, one may pray as he desires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan taught that if one asks Hash-m for his needs in Aramaic, the angels do not deal with his prayer, since they don't understand Aramaic!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Tzibur may pray in any language (Hash-m always accepts its prayer). An individual may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The angels do understand Aramaic!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Yochanan the Kohen Gadol heard a Bas Kol (voice from Heaven) in the innermost part of the Mikdash, saying (in Aramaic) that the lambs (Kohanim) that went to battle defeated the Yevanim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shimon ha'Tzadik heard a Bas Kol in the innermost part of the Mikdash, saying (in Aramaic) that the army that was supposed to attack the Mikdash was canceled, and the king of the Yevanim died, and his decrees were canceled.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They checked and found that he died just when Shimon ha'Tzadik heard the Bas Kol.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> A Bas Kol is unlike angels (it is wont to give messages in various places, which mandates knowledge of all languages).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Gavri'el said those voices, for he knows Aramaic;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Gavri'el taught Yosef the (rest of the) 70 languages before Yosef came before Pharaoh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Birkas ha'Mazon (may be in any language).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"You will eat, be satiated and bless Hash-m" - in any language that you know how to bless.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The oath that one does not know testimony (may be in any language).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "a soul that will sin and hear a curse" - in any language that he understands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The oath of a Shomer (may be in any language).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Techeta-Techeta" from the oath that one does not know testimony.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THINGS THAT MUST BE SAID IN HEBREW</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following must be said in Hebrew: Mikra Bikurim, Chalitzah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We learn Mikra Bikurim from "you will answer...", like it says (about the Berachos and curses) "the Leviyim will answer." Just like the Leviyim answered in Hebrew, also Mikra Bikurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the Leviyim answered in Hebrew?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Kol-Kol" from Moshe.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding the Leviyim it says "in a loud voice." It says about Moshe "Hash-m will answer him in a voice."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like Hash-m answered him in Hebrew, also the Leviyim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> What is the source that Chalitzah (must be in Hebrew?...R. Yehudah says... "she will say like this.")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim learn from "like this"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that if any action is omitted, the Chalitzah is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah learns this (in addition to requiring the verses to be said in Hebrew) because the Torah did not say 'Ko (like this)', rather, "Kachah" (with an extra Chaf);'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim hold that this does not warrant learning an extra law.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">33b----------------------------------------33b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yehudah learn from "she will answer and say"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is used for a Gezeirah Shavah to teach that the Leviyim answered in Hebrew.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't he learn that from the Gezeirah Shavah "Kol-Kol" from Moshe, as above?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He had a tradition for a Gezeirah Shavah "answering-answering" but not for "Kol-Kol."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Wherever it says "Ko", "Kachah" or "answering and saying", it must be in Hebrew.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It says "Ko you will bless (Birkas Kohanim)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It says "Kachah" in Chalitzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>It says "answering and saying" regarding the Leviyim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE BLESSINGS AND CURSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> What was the procedure of the Berachos and curses? When Bnei Yisrael crossed the Jordan River...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Are they not on the other side of the Jordan?" They are far past the Jordan. "Far past Mevo of the sun" is far from (the east,) where the sun is Ba (comes, i.e. rises);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"In the land of the Kena'ani, who dwell in the plain" refers to Har Gerizim and Har Eival in Shomron, where the Kusim (Nochrim who settled in place of the exiled 10 tribes) dwell.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Facing Gilgal" means close to Gilgal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"By Eilonei Moreh" is Shechem;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Another verse says "Avram passed in the land until Shechem, until Alon Moreh" - just like that Alon Moreh is Shechem, also Eilonei Moreh in the Parshah of Berachos and curses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Yosi says, through this I refuted the Kusim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They agree that Eilonei Moreh is Shechem. We learn it from a Gezeirah Shavah. They (who reject the oral tradition) could not find a source for this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Elazar says, "they are across the Jordan" means close to the Jordan. There are several reasons why it cannot mean far from the Jordan:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "(immediately) when you cross the Jordan!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Far from Mevo of the sun" means far from (the west,) where the sun sets (like it says "Ki Va ha'Shemesh");</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It is "in the land of the Kena'ani." Shechem is the land of the Chivi ("Shechem ben Chamor ha'Chivi Nesi ha'Aretz")!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>It says "who dwell in the plain." People of Shechem dwell between the mountains!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>"Facing Gilgal" cannot be Shechem, because Gilgal is not visible from there!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, the verse does not teach where Eilonei Moreh is. Rather, it instructs which way to go during the conquest, just like the cloud of Glory guided Yisrael when they left Mitzrayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"On the way" - go on the roads, not through fields and vineyards;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Who dwell" - go through inhabited areas, not through uninhabited areas;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Go "in the plain", not through mountains and hills;</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>CROSSING THE JORDAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Normally, the Aron traveled after two Degalim (groups of three tribes) started going. On the day that Yisrael crossed the Jordan, the Aron went first;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Normally, the Leviyim carried the Aron. On this day, Kohanim carried it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> Kohanim carried the Aron three times: when Yisrael crossed the Jordan; when they surrounded Yericho; and when it was returned to its place (i.e. brought to the Beis ha'Mikdash).</p>
