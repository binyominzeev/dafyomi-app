<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MIRYAM'S PROPHECY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>She said, my mother will have a son who will save Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>When Moshe was born, the house filled with light. Her father kissed her on the head - 'your prophecy has been fulfilled,'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When they put Moshe in the river, he hit her on the head - 'where is your prophecy?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"His sister stood afar, to know what will happen to him" - to know, what will happen to her prophecy.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE BURIAL OF YAKOV</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Yosef merited (to bury his father...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When they went to bury Yakov, it says "... went up with (Yosef) all Pharaoh's servants...and the whole house of Yosef and his brothers and his father's house;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On the return, the order is "Yosef... his brothers... all who went up with him"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> On the way up, Pharaoh's servants had not yet seen the honor of Yisrael, so they did not honor Yosef's brothers. On the way back, after they saw the honor of Yisrael, they honored them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "They came to the threshing floor of thorns" - does one really pile up thorns?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> This teaches that they surrounded Yakov's coffin with crowns, like a threshing floor is surrounded by a fence of thorns.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The children of Esav, Yishmael, and Keturah all came.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> They came to make war. When they saw Yosef's crown on Yakov's coffin, they put their crowns on it, too.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Thirty-six crowns were hung on his coffin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "They had a great, honorable eulogy there" - even horses and donkeys (were dressed in black, as if they were crying - Maharsha).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>When they got to the Me'aras ha'Machpeilah (his burial cave) Esav stopped the burial.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Esav:</span> Kiryas Arba is Chevron.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> It is called "Kiryas ha'Arba" for four couples were buried there - Adam and Chavah, Avraham and Sarah, Yitzchak and Rivkah, Yakov and Leah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Esav:</span> Yakov buried Leah in his share of the cave. The rest belongs to me!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Yakov's children:</span> You sold your portion!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Esav:</span> I sold the extra portion due to the first born. I did not sell my standard portion.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Yakov's children:</span> You did sell it! "In the grave she'Karisi (I dug)";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Karisi is an expression of acquisition - on overseas islands, selling is called 'Kirah.' (I.e. Yakov bought it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Esav demanded to see the document. It was in Mitzrayim. Naftali was sent to get it, for he is swift like a deer - "Naftali is a sent deer, which gives words of Shefer (beauty)."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We read this 'words of Sofer (the scribe, i.e. the document).'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>Chushim, Dan's son, was hard of hearing. He asked why the burial is being delayed; he was unwilling to leave Yakov unburied until Naftali returned. He hit Esav on the head with a stick (Esav died). Esav's eyes fell to Yakov's legs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>Yakov opened his eyes and smiled - "a Tzadik rejoices when he sees vengeance. He will wash his feet in the blood of the Rasha."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This fulfilled Rivkah's prophecy, "why should I lose both of you in one day?" Even though they died on different days, they were buried the same day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Yosef didn't bury Yakov, his brothers would have! (Why do we say that Yosef buried him?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"His children carried (Yakov) to the land of Kena'an"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They preferred to let Yosef bury him. It was more honor to Yakov to be buried by a king.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE BURIAL OF YOSEF</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Who is greater than Yosef...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> See how dear Mitzvos are to Moshe. All of Yisrael were engaged in despoiling Mitzrayim, but Moshe engaged in Mitzvos - "a wise heart will take Mitzvos."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did Moshe know where Yosef was buried?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They told him that Asher's daughter Serach was still alive; he asked her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Serach:</span> The Mitzriyim buried him in a metal coffin; he was buried in the Nile, so its waters would be blessed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Moshe stood on the bank. 'Yosef! The time has come to fulfill Hash-m's oath to redeem Yisrael, and the time to fulfill your oath (that we return your bones to Eretz Yisrael). If you do not reveal yourself, we are clean of your oath.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Immediately, his coffin floated to the surface.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Do not be surprised that iron floated. Hash-m did a miracle through Elisha, to make iron float.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Elisha was a Talmid of Eliyahu, who was a Talmid of Moshe. All the more so, Hash-m would do such a miracle through Moshe!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Nasan):</span> He was buried where the Mitzri kings are buried.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Moshe stood outside. 'Yosef! The time has come to fulfill Hash-m's oath to redeem Yisrael, and the time to fulfill your oath. If you do not reveal yourself, we are clean of your oath.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Immediately, his coffin moved. Moshe took it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>All 40 years in the wilderness, two Aronos (chests) traveled together. Yosef's coffin and the Aron of the Shechinah (which holds Luchos ha'Bris).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Passers-by would ask about the two chests. They could not fathom that the Aron of the Shechinah traveled with the Aron of a dead person.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Yisrael:</span> It is fitting that they travel together. The deceased fulfilled all that is in the other Aron.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If Moshe didn't take Yosef's bones, would Yisrael not have done so?! (The Shevu'ah applied also to them! Maharsha - granted, at first Yisrael were busy despoiling Mitzrayim, but why didn't they engage with the bones all 40 years in the Midbar?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"The bones of Yosef, which Bnei Yisrael brought from Mitzrayim, they buried in Shechem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If Yisrael didn't bury Yosef, would Yosef's children not have buried him?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"They were an inheritance to the children of Yosef."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions):</span> Yosef's children reasoned, we will let Yisrael bury Yosef, for it is more honorable that a multitude bury him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yisrael reasoned, we will let Moshe take Yosef's bones, for it is more honorable that the great engage in his burial than the small.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was he buried "in Shechem"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> He was kidnapped in Shechem, so it was fitting to return him there. (Even though "a man" (Gavri'el) told Yosef that his brothers went to Dosan, this was a nearby village, and it is considered part of Shechem. Alternatively, Dosan is not a place. Gavri'el meant that they departed from brotherhood.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> One verse says "Moshe took the bones of Yosef with him." Another says "the bones of Yosef, which Bnei Yisrael brought from Mitzrayim"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> If one starts a Mitzvah and does not complete it, and another completes it, the Mitzvah is attributed to the one who completed it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If one did not complete a Mitzvah (through negligence), he is lowered from his greatness - "at that time, Yehudah (who started saving Yosef, but did not finish) went down."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> He even buries his wife and children - "Bas Shu'a, Yehudah's wife, died." "Er and Onan died."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yehudah):</span> Why was Yosef called bones ("You will take my bones with you") in his lifetime?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is because he did not defend his father's honor. His brothers said "your servant, our father", and he did not protest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yehudah):</span> Why did Yosef die before his brothers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is because he conducted himself with authority.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Yosef Hurad (was taken down) to Mitzrayim" - we read this Horid, for he lowered Pharaoh's astrologers from their greatness (when he interpreted the dreams that they could not interpret).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "Potifar, the attendant of Pharaoh, bought him" because he wanted to have homosexual relations with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Gavri'el came and Pir'o (excessively castrated) Potifar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Originally, he is called Potifar. Later, he is called Potifera (the extra Ayin completes the word Pora at the end of his name).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE BURIAL OF MOSHE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Who is greater than Moshe...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> "Hash-m said to me, Rav Lecha (you did much, you need not enter Eretz Yisrael)". Moshe told others (Korach and his followers) "Rav Lachem (it suffices that you are Leviyim, do not seek Kehunah)", therefore he was told "Rav Lecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, "Rav Lecha (you have a master)" - Yehoshua. (It is time for him to lead Yisrael, and you may not impinge on his reign.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also, "Rav Lecha (you have prayed enough)" - so people will not say, the Rebbi is stubborn and the Talmid is patient.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was Hash-m so exacting with Moshe?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We load a camel according to its ability to bear (i.e. according to Moshe's merit, Hash-m was exacting with him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Moshe say "I am 120 years old today"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Today completes my 120th year. This teaches that Hash-m fulfills a Tzadik's years from day to day and from month to month - "I will fulfill the number of your days."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "I cannot leave and come anymore"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is like the simple meaning (I cannot walk).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "his freshness did not wither." "Moshe ascended from Arvos Mo'av to Har Nevo";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There were 12 steps, and Moshe jumped them in one leap.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> I cannot debate in Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The verse teaches that the gates of Chachmah were closed to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Moshe and Yehoshua stood in the Tent of Meeting" - that was the Shabbos of the two. Authority was taken from one and given to the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> If not for the verses, we would not be allowed to say the following!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Moshe died in the portion of Reuven - "Moshe ascended from Arvos Mo'av to Har Nevo"; "The children of Reuven built... Nevo";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Moshe was buried in Gad's portion - "(Gad) desired the first (place that Yisrael conquered, in Ever ha'Yarden), for the lawgiver would be buried there."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The portions of Reuven and Gad are four Mil apart. Who took Moshe to his burial site?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Moshe was in the wings of the Shechinah (the corner of the covering of His glory). Angels were saying "the righteousness of Hash-m he did, and His judgments with Yisrael";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Hash-m was saying "who will stand for Me against evildoers?"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Hash-m asked "who is like the Chacham, who knows how to mediate (between Me and Yisrael)?"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He asked "where will Chachmah be found?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Samalyon):</span> "And Moshe died" - the great Sofer (Chacham) of Yisrael. (Some say that Samalyon was a Chacham. Some say that he is an angel who said this at the time.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ha'Gadol):</span> A voice from Heaven proclaimed throughout the entire camp of Yisrael 'and Moshe died - the great Sofer of Yisrael.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Others say, Moshe did not die;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says here "He died there." Regarding Har Sinai, it says "he was there with Hash-m";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like there, Moshe stood and served Hash-m, also, here.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Berachyah):</span> "He buried him in the valley, in the land of Mo'av, opposite Beis Pe'or" - in spite of all these signs, no one knows where he was buried.</p>
