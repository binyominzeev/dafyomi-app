<p class="dedicationbox">12th CYCLE DEDICATION<br>SOTAH 46 (6 Tamuz) - In loving memory of David Mizrahi (David ben Adele), whose warmth and kindness made him loved by all. Your memory is with us always. By his brother in law, Michael M. Missry. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CALVES KOSHER FOR BEHEADING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Mishnah):</span> The Kohanim say "atone for Your nation Yisrael..." They need not say "the blood will atone for them." That is the Torah's promise that this ritual will atone for them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that a Mum disqualifies a calf (for beheading)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Old age does not disqualify a Parah Adumah (red heifer), but a Mum disqualifies it. A calf is disqualified at the age of two or three, all the more some a Mum should disqualify it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding the Parah, it says "there is not a blemish in it." This teaches that a Mum disqualifies it, but not Eglah Arufah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we expound this way, we should learn that work done with a Parah Adumah does not disqualify it (other than bearing a yoke, which is explicit in the Torah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "work was not done with it (Eglah Arufah)." We should say that work disqualifies a calf, but not a Parah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, Rav Yehudah taught that if one placed a bundle of sacks on a Parah Adumah, it is disqualified. A calf is not disqualified until it carries them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Gezeirah Shavah "yoke-yoke" from Eglah Arufah teaches that work disqualifies also a Parah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the Gezeirah Shavah should teach that a Mum disqualifies a calf, just like it disqualifies a Parah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding the Parah Adumah, it says "there is no Mum in it." This teaches that a Mum disqualifies a red heifer, but not an Eglah Arufah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding Eglah Arufah it says "work was not done with it." We should say that work disqualifies an Eglah Arufah, but not a Parah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. This teaches that work disqualifies a calf, but not Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought to learn a Kal va'Chomer from Eglah Arufah. A Mum does not disqualify a calf, but work does. A Mum disqualifies Korbanos, all the more so work disqualifies them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This Kal va'Chomer is invalid!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Eglah Arufah has a stringency. Age disqualifies it. We cannot learn to Korbanos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Some Korbanos are disqualified by age. For these, one might have thought to learn a Kal va'Chomer. We need the verse to teach that work does not disqualify them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A different verse teaches that work does not disqualify Korbanos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"(An animal that is) blind... or has ringworm, you will not offer these to Hash-m", but you may offer Korbanos that worked!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If only one verse taught that work does not disqualify them, we would have thought that it refers to permitted work, but forbidden work disqualifies them. The second verse teaches that even forbidden work does not disqualify them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is already another verse permitting Korbanos that worked!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"From a Nochri you may not offer (an animal with any of the above blemishes)", but you may offer Korbanos that worked!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We need a third verse. One might have thought that the other verses discuss work done before the animal became a Korban, but work done after it became a Korban disqualifies it. The third verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHICH WORK DISQUALIFIES A CALF</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one placed a bundle of sacks on a Parah, it is disqualified. A calf is not disqualified until it carries them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The Torah explicitly says that a yoke disqualifies a Parah. We learn other work from a Kal va'Chomer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Mum does not disqualify a calf, but work does. A Mum disqualifies a Parah, all the more so work disqualifies it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If you prefer, a Gezeirah Shavah "yoke-yoke" teaches that just like work disqualifies a calf, it also disqualifies a red heifer.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Tana need to say that a Gezeirah Shavah can teach the law? He learns a Kal va'Chomer!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> One can challenge the Kal va'Chomer. Age disqualifies a calf, but not a Parah, so we cannot learn from a calf.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We can disprove the Kal va'Chomer from the law of Korbanos. Mumim disqualify Korbanos, but work does not!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>Therefore, the Tana says that the law can be learned from a Gezeirah Shavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Since we learn from a calf, how can we be more stringent than about a calf? Work disqualifies a calf only if the calf moved the load, but it disqualifies a Parah even without moving!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about whether we learn from Eglah Arufah that work disqualifies a Parah, or from Parshas Parah Adumah itself. Rav Yehudah holds like the following Tana, who learns from Parah itself, therefore, work disqualifies a Parah without moving.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> The Torah says that a yoke disqualifies a Parah. What is the source that other work disqualifies it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "that did not come upon it a yoke" - in any case.  (Rashi - since it does not say 'that a yoke did not come upon it', rather, "'yoke" is at the end, this shows that even without a yoke it is disqualified.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did the Torah specify a yoke?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A yoke disqualifies it whether or not the owner intended for it to work (plow) with it (or just happened to rest the yoke on it). Other work disqualifies only if he intended for it to work.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should say that "that did not come upon it" is a Klal (general term), "a yoke" is a Prat (specific term), and we expound a Klal u'Frat to include only the Prat, i.e. a yoke!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "That" is a Ribuy (inclusion, so we include other work).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A Beraisa teaches similarly about a calf.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> The Torah says that a yoke disqualifies an Eglah Arufah. What is the source that other work disqualifies it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "that work was not done with it."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did the Torah specify a yoke?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A yoke disqualifies it whether or not the owner intended to work with it. Other work disqualifies only with intent for work.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should say that "that work was not done with it" is a Klal, "a yoke" is a Prat, and a Klal u'Frat includes only the Prat, a yoke!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "That" is a Ribuy (inclusion).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> R. Yochanan disqualifies a calf that carried a load for a distance the size of a yoke.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he mean the length of a yoke, or the width?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yakov):</span> He means the width of a yoke, which is one Tefach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he just say 'one Tefach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He wanted to teach (by the way) that the width of a yoke is one Tefach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is that important to know?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> For commerce (if one sells a yoke, it must be this wide).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE PLACE OF BEHEADING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan ben Sha'ul):</span> Why did the Torah say to behead a calf in a Nachal Eisan (Rashi - a rocky valley; Rambam - by a raging river)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan ben Sha'ul):</span> Something (a calf) that did not yield fruit should be beheaded in a place that does not yield fruits, to atone for (the murder of) the victim, who was prevented from bearing fruits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which fruits does he refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He refers to children.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, we should not bring a calf if the victim was too old to have children, or sterile!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he refers to Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They descend to a Nachal Eisan. "Eisan" is understood simply, i.e. Kasheh (Rashi - hard; Rambam - mighty).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that Eisan means hard?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">46b----------------------------------------46b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Eisan is your sitting, and you put your nest in a rock." It also says "listen, mountains, the quarrel of Hash-m, and the Eisanim, the foundations of the land";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Others say, "Eisan" means old - "an Eisan nation, a nation that always was."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They behead it with a chopping knife from the back.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Arifah (beheading)-Arifah" from a bird offered for a Chatas, whose neck is pinched from the Oref (back).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not seed or work the land where Arifah was done.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yoshiyah):</span> "That is not worked or seeded" teaches that Arifah is done in a place that was not worked or seeded;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yonasan):</span> The verse forbids working or seeding the land after Arifah was done there.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> All agree that the verse forbids the future. It says "and it will not be seeded"! (We learn seeding and working from each other.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue about whether or not it also forbids the past.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yoshiyah holds that since it does not say (similarly) 'it will not be worked', rather, "Asher Lo Ye'aved", i.e. the past.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yonasan holds that since it does not say "that it was not worked", it means the future.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>R. Yoshiyah holds that "that" (does not connote a command. Surely, it) denotes the past!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>R. Yonasan expounds "that" to include (other work, like we shall see shortly).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It is permitted to comb flax and quarry rocks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> It says "that will not be worked or seeded." What is the source to forbid other uses of the land?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "that it will not be worked" - in any way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say "it will not be seeded"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that it is forbidden only to work the land, e.g. seeding; but combing flax or quarrying rocks is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should say that "that will not be worked" is a Klal, "and will not be seeded" is a Prat, and from a Klal u'Frat we learn only the Prat (seeding)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "That" is a Ribuy (this shows that we do not learn like suggested).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE IMPORTANCE OF ESCORTING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The elders of the city wash their hands...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> "All the elders of the city close to the corpse will wash their hands on the beheaded calf in the valley" - why must it say "beheaded"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that they wash in the place it was beheaded.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "They say 'our hands did not spill this blood, and our eyes did not see.'" Would we have thought that Beis Din are murderers?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it means, it is not the case that he came to us and we sent him away without food, and left him without an escort.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> We force people to escort, since the reward for it is immeasurable - "the guards saw a man leave the city... they said, show us the entrance and we will do Chesed with you... He showed them the entrance."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Chesed did they do with him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They killed the entire city, but spared him and his family.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"The man went to the land of Chitim and built a city; he called it Luz, it is still called Luz today."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This is the Luz in which Techeiles is dyed; Sancheriv and Nevuchadnetzar were unable to disturb it. Even the angel of death may not enter!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>When old people want to die, they leave the city and die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The man that showed them the entrance did not speak nor walk to escort them, still he merited to save himself and his descendants for eternity. All the more so, one who walks to escort people merits this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did he show them the entrance?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chizkiyah):</span> He contorted his mouth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> He pointed with his finger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> Because this Kena'ani pointed with his finger, he merited to save himself and his descendants for eternity.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> One who walks on the way without an escort should learn Torah - "it is an escort of grace for your head."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Pharaoh escorted Avraham four steps when Avraham left Mitzrayim. His reward for this was the right to enslave Avraham's descendants for 400 years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One who escorts a guest four Amos in the city ensures that the guest will not be harmed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ravina escorted Rava bar Yitzchak four Amos. On his way, Rava bar Yitzchak encountered (what normally would cause) damage, and was saved from it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE OBLIGATION TO ESCORT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Rebbi escorts his Talmid to the outermost houses of the city. One escorts his colleague to the limit one may go to on Shabbos (2000 Amos outside the city). There is not limit to how far a Talmid escorts his Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How far does he escort his Rebbi?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> He escorts one Parsah (four Mil. A Mil is about a kilometer.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For one's primary Rebbi, one escorts him three Parsa'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav Kahana escorted Rav Simi bar Ashi from Fum Nahara until Bei Tzinisi of Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> "In a land where Adam (a man) did not pass, and a man did not sit" - if no man passed, surely no man sat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, this teaches that a land is inhabited only if Adam (ha'Rishon) decreed so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rav Mordechai escorted Rav Ashi from Hegronya until Bei Kipi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Anyone who does not escort or is not escorted, it is as if he murders.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had the people of Yericho escorted Elisha, he would not have incited bears to attack the children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>"(Elisha) headed towards Beis Kel. Ne'arim (youths), Ketanim (minors) left the city and derided "go, bald one, for you have ruined our income (by curing the water)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "Ne'arim Ketanim"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> They were Menu'arim (emptied) from Mitzvos, and Ketanim (small) in faith (in Hash-m to provide their needs).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> They were youths, but debased themselves like minors.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> Perhaps "Ne'arim" refers to their hometown (like we find elsewhere)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "They captured from Yisrael a Na'arah, a minor" - a Na'arah is not a minor!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Pedas):</span> She was a minor from Ne'uran.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here, we know that they were from Yericho.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "(Elisha) saw them and cursed them with Hash-m's name." What does this mean? (Maharsha - why did he curse them? This is forbidden! Chazon Ish - one may curse one who transgresses b'Meizid (they disgraced a Navi.). This is proper, lest people not respect Torah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> He literally saw them (and the curse came by itself);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> Wherever Chachamim put their eyes, death or poverty resulted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> He saw that all of them were conceived on Yom Kipur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> He saw they grew ponytails like the pagans.</p>
