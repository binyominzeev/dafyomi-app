<p class="dedicationbox">12th CYCLE DEDICATION<br>SOTAH 26-28 - A week of study material has been dedicated by Mrs. Rita Grunberger of Queens, N.Y., in loving memory of her husband, Reb Yitzchok Yakov (Irving) ben Eliyahu Grunberger. Irving Grunberger helped many people quietly in an unassuming manner and is dearly missed by all who knew him. His Yahrzeit is 10 Sivan. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHICH WOMEN DRINK</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa #1 - R. Meir):</span> If he married Me'uberes (Chaveiro) or Meinekes Chaveiro, she does not drink and does not get her Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir holds that a man may not marry Me'uberes or Meinekes Chaveiro. If he married her, he must divorce her and may never remarry her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, he may not marry her. If he did, he must divorce her. When the period of nursing finishes, he may remarry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Also, if a youth (without a wife or childless) married a sterile woman or one too old to have children, she does not drink and does not get her Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Eliezer says, he can marry another woman, and fulfill the Mitzvah of having children through his second wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If one warned his Arusah or Shomeres Yavam, and she was secluded after Nisu'in, she drinks, or forfeits her Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If one marries a woman pregnant with or nursing his baby, she drinks, or forfeits her Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If a youth married a sterile woman or one too old to have children, and he has children or a second wife who can have children, she drinks or forfeits her Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If a woman is married to a Mamzer or Nasin (and is permitted to him), or to a convert or freed slave, or she is an Ailonis, she drinks or forfeits her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question (against Rav Nachman):</span> This shows that an Ailonis may drink!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Nachman holds like a different Tana.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> An Ailonis does not drink, nor receive her Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We learn from "she will be vindicated, and bear seed." This excludes an Ailonis, who cannot bear seed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim (i.e. the Tana of Beraisa #1) learn from that verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> "She will be vindicated, and bear seed" - if she was sterile, she will bear children;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> If so, sterile women will (provoke their husbands to warn them and) seclude themselves, in order to have children!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is it fair that a sterile woman who is too modest to do this will not bear children?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rather, the verse teaches that if she used to give birth in pain, she will give birth easily. If she used to bear daughters, she will bear sons. If she used to bear short babies, she will bear tall ones. If she bore dark babies, she will bear light babies. (One would not become a Sotah merely to ease childbirth or to have better children.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WOMEN WHO DRINK</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> The wife of a Mamzer (drinks, i.e. if she is permitted to him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious. Why shouldn't she drink?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the Torah does not want to permit her to her husband, lest she bear Mamzerim. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> The wife of a convert or freed slave...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious. Why shouldn't she drink?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that "speak to Bnei Yisrael" excludes converts. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we expound thusly?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "And say (to them)" includes converts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The wife of a Kohen drinks...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious. Why shouldn't she drink?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "she was not forced, she is forbidden.." This implies that if she was raped, she is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Kohen's wife is forbidden even if she was raped. Therefore, one might have thought that she does not drink. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (After drinking) she is permitted to her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> The Mishnah teaches about a woman who deteriorates after drinking.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, this shows that she is guilty!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Her limbs deteriorate, but not like those of a guilty Sotah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that she was defiled. She is not dying like a normal guilty Sotah because she was raped. If her husband is a Kohen, we would say that she is forbidden. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The wife of a Seris drinks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "(if a man had Bi'ah with you) other than your husband." One might have thought that since her husband is impotent, she is excluded from the Parshah. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. (He is impotent, but his Bi'ah is considered Bi'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FROM WHOM SHE MAY BE WARNED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She may be warned against seclusion with any of the Arayos...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">26b----------------------------------------26b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says twice "she was defiled", to teach that she becomes (permanently) forbidden to her husband and the Bo'el;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that the Parshah applies only when she would have been permitted to the Bo'el (if she were widowed or divorced) if not for the adultery. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Except for a child...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"A man" excludes a child.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah also excludes 'one who is not a man'. What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is a Shachuf (one who cannot have proper Bi'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Shmuel taught that one can warn from a Shachuf, and if a Shachuf has Bi'as Isur with a woman, he disqualifies her from Terumah (like a normal man)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Shmuel have to teach that one can warn from a Shachuf? This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that "a man lied with you, (and emitted) semen" excludes a Shachuf, who is incapable of this. Shmuel teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Shmuel need to teach that a Shachuf disqualifies from Kehunah? This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He will not Yechalel (profane) his seed" (is written with two 'Yudim', to teach that he also disqualifies the woman from Terumah). One might have thought that only one who can have seed can disqualify a woman. Shmuel teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, it excludes a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav Hamnuna taught that one can warn from a Nochri, and a Nochri disqualifies a woman from Terumah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Rav Hamnuna have to teach that one can warn from a Nochri? This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says twice "she was defiled", to teach that she becomes forbidden to her husband and the Bo'el;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One might have thought that this excludes a Nochri, who was forbidden to her before the adultery. Rav Hamnuna teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Rav Hamnuna have to teach that a Nochri disqualifies a woman from Terumah? This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that "when a Bas Kohen Sihyeh (will be) to a non-Kohen (she may not eat Terumah)" applies only to a man who can have Havayah (Kidushin). Rav Hamnuna teaches that this is not so, like R. Yochanan taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a Nochri or slave has Bi'ah with a Bas Kohen, Bas Levi, or Bas Yisrael, he disqualifies her from Kehunah - "when a Bas Kohen will be a widow or divorcee (she may again eat Terumah)";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>This applies only when she was married to a Yisrael, from whom she can be widowed or divorced (but if she was with a Nochri or slave, she is permanently forbidden to Kehunah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We still did not answer what 'one who is not a man' excludes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> It excludes an animal, for bestiality is not considered Znus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava mi'Parzakiya):</span> We learn this from "do not bring (for a Korban) Esnan of (wages given to) a harlot or barter of (something exchanged for) a dog."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Esnan of a (Rashi - harlot for a) dog and the barter of a harlot may be brought. The verse concludes "both of them" - of the four combinations, only the two mentioned are abominations.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Shmuel taught that one may warn against a Shachuf (even though he cannot have proper Bi'ah. If so,) what do we learn from "semen"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Semen" excludes something else.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this something else?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> He warned her against Bi'ah Lo k'Darkah (in the anus).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> It says "Mishkevei (plural) Ishah" (this equates Lo k'Darkah to normal Bi'ah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> He warned her against intimacy without Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> That is mere licentiousness. The Torah does not forbid a woman to her husband for that!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Abaye):</span> He warned her against touching (of his genitals to hers).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is like the opinion that Ha'ara'ah (the first stage of Bi'ah, which is normally considered like full Bi'ah) is entrance of the crown.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that Ha'ara'ah is touching, surely he can warn against this! What does the Mishnah exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Defense of Answer #2:</span> Really, he warned her against intimacy without Bi'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One might have thought that warning depends on what disturbs the husband. If he is concerned for this, it is proper warning. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
