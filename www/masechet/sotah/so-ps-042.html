<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FLATTERY (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Any Tzibur that includes flatterers is despised like a Nidah - "a Tzibur of flattery is Galmud";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Nidah is called Galmud, since she is Gemulah (weaned, i.e. separated) from her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Any Tzibur that includes flatterers is eventually exiled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is called Galmud, and it says "bereaved, Galmudah, exiled."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah bar Aba):</span> Four categories do not receive the Divine Presence: scoffers; flatterers; liars; and those who speak Lashon ha'Ra.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK MASHU'ACH MILCHAMAH</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT WE TELL THE SOLDIERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Kohen anointed for war (to speak to the army) speaks to them in Hebrew - "he will speak to the nation", in Hebrew.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>"He says to them 'Shema, Yisrael... (you are fighting) your enemies, not your brothers."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This is not like a fight between (the tribes of) Yehudah and Shimon, or Shimon against Binyamin - when fighting your brothers, the captors have mercy on the captives.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(When Yisrael took captives from Yehudah,) "the unclothed among the captives, they clothed, gave them shoes, to eat and drink, anointed them, and put those unable to walk on donkeys."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>You are fighting your enemies. If you fall into their hands, they will not have mercy on you.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>"Do not soften your hearts, do not fear or panic..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Do not soften your hearts" due to the neighing of the horses and brandishing swords;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Do not fear" the clanging of the shields and the swarm of soldiers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Do not panic" from the sounding of the horns;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"Do not be terrified" from the shouting, "for Hash-m goes with you."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>They come with the strength of flesh and blood. You come with the potency of Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Pelishtim relied on Golyas. He fell by the sword, and they fell with him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Amon relied on Shovach (their general). He fell by the sword, and they fell with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>You are not like them. "Hash-m comes with you to fight for you" refers to the Aron.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> How does the verse show that he speaks in Hebrew?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says here "he speaks", like it says regarding Matan Torah "Moshe would speak, and Hash-m would answer him aloud";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like that was in Hebrew, also here.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> "The Kohen will draw close and speak to the nation" - perhaps any Kohen may speak!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "The Shotrim (enforcers) will speak." Just like the Shotrim are appointed, also the Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Kohen Gadol speaks!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He must be like the Shotrim, who have someone above them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Kohen Gadol also has someone above him, i.e. the king!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We mean, he must have someone above him in his service.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Sgan speaks!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Sgan is not appointed over anything.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Chanina):</span> The Sgan is picked, so if the Kohen Gadol cannot serve, the Sgan will serve in his stead.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> "He tells them Shema, Yisrael."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are these words used?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Hash-m tells us that even if our only Mitzvah was saying Shema Yisrael morning and evening, we would not be handed over to our enemies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> "Do not soften your hearts, do not fear..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He speaks twice with them, once at the border (when leaving Eretz Yisrael), and once at the battlefront;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>At the border, he instructs which people should return home (those who just built houses...)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">42b----------------------------------------42b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>At the battlefront, he says "do not soften your hearts, do not fear, panic or be terrified", corresponding to four things the enemy does to instill fear- they clang shields, blow trumpets, shout, and make their horses neigh.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE ENCOUNTER WITH GOLYAS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Philistines relied on Golyas...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He is called so, for he stood b'GiLuy Panim (brazenly) in front of Hash-m. He said "pick for yourselves an Ish, and he will come down to me."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Ish" refers to Hash-m - "Hash-m Ish Milchamah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Therefore, Hash-m arranged that he fall to (someone called) the son of an Ish - "David Ben Ish Efrati."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> In three places, Golyas's words suggested his own downfall: "pick for yourselves a man, that he will come down to (overcome) me"; "if he can fight with me, and he will strike me"; and "am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also David said "you come at me with a sword, spear and javelin"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> David concluded "I come at you with the name of Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "He (Golyas) drew close every morning and evening" to prevent them from saying Shema Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "He stood for 40 days", corresponding to the 40 days in which the Torah was given.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "A man of the Benayim came out of the Pelishtim camp" - what is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> He was MeVuNeh (robust, well-proportioned), devoid of all blemish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> He was BeiNoni (medium) among his brothers (they are mentioned below).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (d'Vei R. Shilo):</span> His stature was like a BiNYan (building).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Yochanan):</span> He was conceived among (BeiN) 100 men and a dog (who had Bi'ah with his mother in one night).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> "His name was Golyas, of Gas" - all threshed his mother, like a Gas (winery).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The word Ma'arachos (ranks) is written deficiently, like Ma'aros, to teach that everyone had Ha'ara'ah (the first stage of Bi'ah) with his mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In one place, his mother is called Harafah. Elsewhere, she is called Orpah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav or Shmuel):</span> Her real name is Harafah. She is called Orpah because all had Bi'ah with her from the Oref (back).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (the other of Rav and Shmuel):</span> Her real name is Orpah. She is called Harafah because all threshed her, like ha'Rifos (crushed wheat).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "These four were born to Harafah in Gas, and fell to David and his servants." Who are the four?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> They are Saf, Medon, Golyas, and Yishbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> "Orpah kissed her mother-in-law (No'omi, and deserted her), and Rus clung to her." Hash-m arranged that the sons of the one who kissed fall to the sons of the one who clung.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> In the merit of four tears that Orpah shed for her mother-in-law, she merited to bear four mighty men - "they (Rus and Orpah) raised their voices and cried more." (Rashi - it says that she cried twice. Presumably, each time a tear came from each eye.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We read "the Etz (wood) of his spear", but it is written Chetz (arrow)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> This shows that the verses do not even relate Chetzi (half) of his might.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that one should not relate the full praise of a Rasha.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the verse should not relate any of his praise!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It relates half his might, to praise David (that he did not fear to fight him).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SHOVACH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Bnei Amon relied on Shovach...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He is called Shovach, and elsewhere he is called Shofech!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav or Shmuel):</span> His name is Shofech. He is called Shovach because he was (tall) like a Shovech (dovecote).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (The other of Rav and Shmuel):</span> His name is Shovach. He is called Shofech because anyone who sees him is Nishpach (spilled) in front of him like a flask.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav or Shmuel):</span> "Ashpaso (his quiver) is like an open grave, they (Nevuchadnetzar's soldiers) are all mighty" - when they throw an arrow, they make Ashpasos (heaps) of corpses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is because they are skilled archers (but are not so mighty).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "They are all mighty."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav and Shmuel):</span> When they defecate, they make Ashpasos (wasteheaps) of excrement (i.e. they eat greatly).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is due to intestinal sickness!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "They are all mighty."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Mari):</span> We learn that a large amount of excrement is a result of intestinal sickness.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What practical application does this have?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Such a person should seek a cure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami or R. Asi):</span> "Worry in the heart, a person Yashchenah (Ralbag - he should suppress it; Malbim - it lowers him) " - he should divert it (Yasichenah) from his mind.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(The other of R. Ami and R. Asi):</span> He should speak about it (Yasichenah) with others.</p>
