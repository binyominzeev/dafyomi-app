<p class="dedicationbox">12th CYCLE DEDICATION<br>SOTAH 23-25 - A week of study material has been dedicated by Mrs. Rita Grunberger of Queens, N.Y., in loving memory of her husband, Reb Yitzchok Yakov (Irving) ben Eliyahu Grunberger. Irving Grunberger helped many people quietly in an unassuming manner and is dearly missed by all who knew him. His Yahrzeit is 10 Sivan. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WOMEN WHO DO NOT DRINK (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Mishnah):</span> The following do not drink or receive a Kesuvah: a woman who admits that she sinned, or if witnesses testified that she sinned, or she refuses to drink;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If her husband does not want her to drink, or if he had Bi'ah with her after the seclusion, she receives her Kesuvah but does not drink;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Beis Shamai say, if her husband died before she drank, she receives her Kesuvah but does not drink;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Beis Hillel say, either she drinks, or she does not get a Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Meir says, if a man married Me'uberes Chaveiro or Meinekes Chaveiro (a woman pregnant with or nursing a baby from another man), she does not drink nor receive a Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Chachamim say, he can separate from her and remarry her (after the nursing period ends. Since she could be married to him later, she may drink.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If a woman is an Ailonis (she does not develop like a normal female), too old to have children, or unable to have children, she does not drink nor receive a Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Eliezer says, her husband can fulfill the Mitzvah of having children through another wife. (Since she could remain with him, she may drink.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>All other women either drink or do not get a Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>A Kohen's wife drinks, and is permitted to her husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>The wife of a Seris may drink. (Rashi Sof 26a - we refer to one who does not develop like a normal male. It cannot be someone castrated, for he may not remain married. Rashi here is a misprint - Maharsha 26a.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>A husband can warn his wife not to be secluded with any Ervah (forbidden relationship), except for a child or one who is not a man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Beis Din can warn the wife of a man that became deaf, or insane, or was imprisoned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She may not drink. She is warned, so that if she is secluded, she forfeits her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, when her husband is released from jail, he can make her drink.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A SHOMERES YAVAM AND AN ARUSAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> The Mishnah says that an Arusah and a Shomeres Yavam do not drink. This implies that they can be warned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Speak to Bnei Yisrael and say" - this is extra, to teach that one may warn an Arusah or a Shomeres Yavam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Our Mishnah is like R. Yonasan:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yoshiyah):</span> "Under your husband" excludes an Arusah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps even a Shomeres Yavam is excluded!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ish Ish (a man, a man)" includes her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yonasan says, "Under your husband" excludes a Shomeres Yavam;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps an Arusah drinks!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "That will stray under her husband" excludes her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yonasan holds that an Arusah is closer to being fully married (and if there were only one verse to exclude, we would say that she drinks, but a Shomeres Yavam does not), because her husband married her himself, and a stranger who has Bi'ah with her is killed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yoshiyah holds that a Shomeres Yavam is closer to being fully married (and therefore she drinks, but an Arusah does not) because the Yavam can marry her (do Yibum) against her will, i.e. she need not agree to Chupah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yonasan learn from "Ish Ish"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This includes the wife of a deaf man, a lunatic, or a man stricken with bewilderment.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">24b----------------------------------------24b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yoshiyah learn from "under your husband"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This equates the Sotah to her husband (i.e. just like a blind man cannot make his wife drink, a blind woman cannot drink).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need verses to teach that an Arusah and a Shomeres Yavam do not drink? Another source teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Chanina - Beraisa):</span> "Other than your husband" - she drinks only if she had Bi'ah with her husband before the seclusion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rami bar Chama):</span> We need to exclude an Arusah who had Bi'ah with her husband during Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The corresponding case of a Shomeres Yavam would be that she had Bi'ah with the Yavam after she was widowed. If so, she is fully married. She would not be called a Shomeres Yavam!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> (If a Yavam had Bi'ah with his Yevamah, but did not complete the Bi'ah, or did not intend for Yibum,) she becomes his full wife in all respects;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We can answer according to Shmuel, who says that she is acquired only regarding what is written in the Parshah of Yibum (exemption from Chalitzah and inheritance).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav holds like R. Yoshiyah, and Shmuel like R. Yonasan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Rav can even hold like R. Yonasan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yonasan needed a verse to teach that a Shomeres Yavam does not drink. Without the verse, we would have considered her like a full wife, and she would drink!</p>
