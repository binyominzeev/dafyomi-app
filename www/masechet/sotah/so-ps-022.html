<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>AN IGNORAMUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (R. Elazar):</span> If one learned written Torah and Mishnah, but not the reasons and resolutions of the Mishnayos, he is an ignoramus;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> He is a Bor (crude, empty person).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #3 (R. Yanai):</span> He is like a Kusi (after Sancheriv exiled the 10 tribes, he settled Nochrim (called Kusim) in their place. The Kusim converted to avoid being eaten by lions, but did not accept the Oral Torah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #4 (R. Acha bar Yakov):</span> He is like a witch.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> A witch says things, without knowing what they mean. This one recites teachings, without understanding them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> An ignoramus is one who does not recite Shema Yisrael with its Berachos, morning and evening;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Chachamim say, it is one who does not don Tefilin;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Ben Azai says, it is one who does not have Tzitzis on his garment;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Yonasan ben Yosef says, it is one who has children and does not raise them to learn Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Others say, even if he learned written Torah and Mishnah, but not the reasons and resolutions of the Mishnayos, he is an ignoramus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he learned written Torah but not Mishnah, he is a Bor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"I will plant Beis Yisrael and Beis Yehudah, the seed of men and the seed of animals" refers to one who did not learn Torah or Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> "My son, fear Hash-m and the king; do not mingle with Shonim" - Shonim are those who recite Mishnayos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that it means those who repeat a sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If one sins and repeats the sin, it becomes permitted (in his eyes) to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Those who recite teachings destroy the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can this really be?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> Yes, because they rule based on the (simple reading of) Mishnayos (without truly understanding them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Yehoshua) Question:</span> How can one say they destroy the world? They establish the world!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Halichos (the ways) of the world are to him" (to one who learns Halachos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They destroy the world, because they rule based on the Mishnayos.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PERUSHIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A woman who is a Perushah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following destroy the world: a virgin who prays excessively, a widow who is frequent among her neighbors, and a youth whose months were not fulfilled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan said that we learned fear of sin from a (particular) virgin, and (strategies for) receiving reward from a widow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan heard a virgin fall on her face and pray that men should not stumble with her and lose their world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>There was a widow who used to pray every day in R. Yochanan's Beis Medrash, even though there was a Beis ha'Keneses near her.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Isn't there a Beis ha'Keneses near you?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">The widow:</span> I come here to receive reward for each step!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People like Yuchni bas Rativi (a witch who made people think that her prayers saved women from difficult births) destroy the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a youth whose months were not fulfilled?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chachamim of Bavel):</span> It is a Chacham who rebels against his Rabbis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Aba):</span> It is a Talmid who is not qualified to rule, and gives rulings.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> "She made fall many corpses" refers to a Chacham who is not qualified to rule, and rules;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Awesome are the amount she has killed" refers to a Chacham who is qualified to rule, and does not rule.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the proper age to rule?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is 40 years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rabah ruled younger than this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah was as great like the greatest Chacham in the city. (In such a case, even one less than 40 may rule.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Blows of Perushim...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are seven types of (improper) Perushim: Shichmi, Nakfi, Kizai, mi'Duchya, one who says 'what is my obligation? I will do it!', from love, and from fear.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shichmi do not act for Hash-m's sake;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Nakfi shuffle their feet like humble people, and stub their toes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Kizai bleed from bumping into walls, like one who closes his eyes to avoid looking at women;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Shilo):</span> Mi'Duchya walk bent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is praiseworthy to say 'what is my obligation? I will do it!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he says 'what else is my obligation? I will do it!' (This implies that he has fulfilled his obligation.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye and Rava):</span> From love and fear (of reward or punishment) should not be taught (for these are praiseworthy)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One should always engage in Torah and Mitzvos, even Lo Lishmah (with ulterior motives), for this will lead him to do them Lishmah (to become close to Hash-m).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Some things are hidden from people, and others are revealed. Hash-m's great Beis Din (to which all is revealed) exacts payment from those who (deceivingly) dress like Perushim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">King Yanai (to his wife):</span> You need not fear the true Perushim, nor those who are not Perushim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You need fear only the colored (those who portray themselves to be Perushim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They sin like Zimri, and anticipate reward like Pinchas.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MERIT SUSPENDS PUNISHMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> Merit does not suspend death of a guilty Sotah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it did, women would not fear the water. Also, people would suspect innocent women who survive;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They would say that they are guilty, and merit suspended their death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rebbi says, merit suspends the death. She will not give birth or become healthy. Rather, she gets increasingly sick, and eventually dies like the Torah says.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If her Minchah became Tamei before Kidush in a Kli Shares, it is redeemed, like any other Minchah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If her Minchah became Tamei after Kidush in a Kli Shares, it is burned, like any other Minchah.</p>
