<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE PROCEDURE OF <i>MENACHOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He takes it up and burns it in a Kli Shares.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This cannot be! (It is burned on the Mizbe'ach after it is salted!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he takes it up in order to burn it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He salts it and puts it on the fire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>We learn from "you will salt all your Menachos."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> After the Kometz is offered, the remainder of the Minchah may be eaten.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn from "the Kohen will burn Azkarasah (the Kometz, which makes it pleasing to Hash-m)." "The rest of the Minchah is to Aharon and his children."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Amora'im argue about the offering of the Kometz:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> Once Kometz catches fire, the rest of the Minchah may be eaten;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Once he majority of the Kometz catches fire, the rest of the Minchah may be eaten.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Kohanim may mix it with wine, oil, and honey.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this allowed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Kodshim are "for grandeur." They are eaten royally.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The only Isur is to ferment it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "Do not bake their portion to be Chametz..." - even their portion may not be baked to be Chametz.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE <i>SOTAH </i>OFFERING IS UNIQUE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All (other) Menachos require oil and frankincense...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is not true! It says about Minchas Chotei (a Minchah that a very poor person brings in place of a Korban Chatas for certain Aveiros) "do not put on it oil, and do not put on it frankincense!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah means that (standard) Menachos require oil and frankincense, come from wheat, and from fine flour;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Minchas Chotei, even though it does not require oil and frankincense, comes from wheat, and from fine flour;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Minchas ha'Omer, even though it comes from barley, requires oil and frankincense, and comes from finely sifted (barley) flour.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Minchas Sotah does not require oil and frankincense, and it comes from unsifted barley flour.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Really, Minchas Chotei should require oil and frankincense, so that a sinner should not save money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah said that it does not, in order that his Korban will not be glorious.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Really, a (standard) Chatas (a lamb or kid, e.g. for eating) Chelev should require Nesachim (accompanying flour and wine offerings), in order that a sinner should not save money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah said that it does not, in order that his Korban will not be glorious.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Chatas of a Metzora and his Korban Asham do require Nesachim, for they do not come for a sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> But R. Shmuel bar Nachmani taught, Tzara'as comes for a punishment for (even one of) seven specific sins!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Suffering the Tzara'as is the atonement. The Korban merely permits him to eat Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the Chatas of a Nazir should require Nesachim, for it does not come for a sin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon holds like R. Eliezer ha'Kapar, who says that a Nazir is a sinner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Gamliel):</span> Just like (her actions were like those of an animal...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Gamliel):</span> Allow me to make a beautiful exposition:</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">15b----------------------------------------15b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir (8b) said, since she fed the Bo'el delicacies, therefore her Korban is animal food.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> That applies to a rich woman, but not to a poor woman!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, since she did an animal act, her Korban is animal food.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TAKING THE WATER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Kohen takes an earthenware flask, and puts in it a half Log of water from the Kiyor (fountain. A Log is about a half liter);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, he puts in a quarter Log.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like R. Yehudah requires a smaller passage to be written in the scroll, he also requires a smaller quantity of water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Kohen enters the Heichal and turns to his right. There was a place, one Amah by one Amah, covered by marble with a ring (handle) attached.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He lifts the cover, takes soil from underneath, and puts on the water so it may be seen on the surface - "from the soil in the ground of the Mishkan, the Kohen will take and put into the water."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> A new earthenware flask is required.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He learns from a Gezeirah Shavah "Kli-Kli" from a Metzora:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a Metzora needs a new earthenware Kli, also a Sotah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a Metzora needs a new earthenware Kli?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He will slaughter one bird into an earthenware Kli, on Mayim Chayim (flowing water).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like flowing water was not used before, we require a Kli that was not used before.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he learns a Sotah's Kli from a Metzora's Kli, he should also learn about the water, and require flowing water for a Sotah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, R. Yishmael requires this!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Yishmael requires that water of the Kiyor come from a spring. Chachamim allow other (Mikvah) water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn Sotah from Metzora. A Metzora is more stringent. His Taharah requires cedar, hyssop and scarlet thread!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> He learns from "in an earthenware Kli" - the Kli already mentioned (i.e. regarding a Metzora).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Chachamim permit a used Kli only if it has not blackened (from cooking). If its face blackened, it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like water is unchanged, the Kli must be unchanged.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If it had blackened, and it was returned to a furnace and remade, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we say, once it became invalid, it remains invalid?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, do we say, since it is new again, it is valid?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> R. Elazar (Tosfos' text - R. Eliezer) says, if one carried a bundle on his back, hanging from cedar, hyssop and scarlet thread, they are unfit for a Metzora.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though they can be bent back into shape, they remain invalid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is no proof. The case is, some of the wood peeled off, and they cannot be restored.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He enters the Heichal, turns to the right...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Every time one turns, he should turn to the right.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There was a place there, one Amah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1) Suggestion:</span> "From the soil that will be" - perhaps one may bring in soil from outside!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He takes from "in the ground of the Mishkan."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he must dig with an axe!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "That will be."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> If there is (loose) soil in the ground of the Mishkan, he takes it. If not, he brings from outside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - Isi ben Yehudah):</span> "From the soil that will be..." teaches that he may take soil from the outside;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"In the ground of the Mishkan" includes the Mishkenos of Shilo, Nov, Givon, and the Beis ha'Mikdash.</p>
