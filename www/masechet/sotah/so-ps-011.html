<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MIDAH K'NEGED MIDAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina bar Papa):</span> "He (Yakov) sent him (Yosef) from the Emek of Chevron - the deep (Amukah) plan (told to) the Tzadik buried in Chevron - "Know that your seed with be a stranger..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Avshalom say "I do not have a son"? "Three sons and a daughter were born to Avshalom"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yitzchak bar Avdimi):</span> He did not have a son fit to be king.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Chisda):</span> We have a tradition, anyone who burns another's grain does not leave a son to inherit himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Avshalom commanded his servants to burn Yoav's grain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Similarly, good deeds are rewarded (Midah k'Neged Midah). Miryam...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That was not Midah k'Neged Midah! She waited a short time, and Yisrael waited a week for her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah should say that reward is not Midah k'Neged Midah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> The Mishnah says 'similarly'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Mishnah means that similarly, the reward for good deeds resembles the deed. However, Hash-m's attribute of rewarding is greater than that of punishing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> "His sister stood from afar" - this entire verse alludes to the Divine Presence.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"She stood" - "Hash-m came and stood."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"His sister" - "say to Chachmah, you are my sister."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"From afar" - "from afar, Hash-m appeared to me."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"To know" - "for Hash-m is a G-d of knowledge."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>"What" - "What does Hash-m ask of you?"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>"Will be done" - "Hash-m will not do"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>"To him" - "he called Him Hash-m Shalom."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE COUNSEL AGAINST THE SAVIOR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav or Shmuel):</span> "A new king arose" - this is literally true.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav or Shmuel):</span> He (was the same king, just he) made new decrees.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He says so way because it does not say "the king died."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>"Who did not know Yosef" - he acted as if he did not know him at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "He said to his nation, behold, Bnei Yisrael..." Since he began the counsel, he was punished first - "(The frogs will come) in you and your nation and all your servants."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "let us deal wisely with him"? It should say 'with them'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer: (R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> They wanted to deal wisely with the savior of Yisrael:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>How can we kill him (and escape Hash-m's punishment, which is Midah k'Neged Midah)? If we will use fire, "Hash-m will judge in fire!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is not wise to use a sword - "all flesh with His sword."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rather, we will kill him in water. Hash-m swore not to bring another flood.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They did not know that He swore not to flood the entire world, but He may flood one nation;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Alternatively, He will not bring a flood, but they may fall into the water - "the Mitzriyim fled to the sea."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "In the matter that they Zadu (plotted) against them" - they were cooked in the pot in which they cooked.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Zadu alludes to a pot?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Va'Yazed (cooked) Yakov Nazid (cooked food)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Three people were in the counsel to drown the savior: Bilam, Iyov and Yisro;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Bilam gave the counsel. He was killed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Iyov was silent. He was punished with afflictions;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Yisro fled. He merited that his descendants sit in the great Sanhedrin - "from the families of Chachamim, Talmidim of Ya'avetz - Tir'asim, Shim'asim, Suchasim - these are the Kinim who come from the father of the house of Rachav";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>(Kinim come from Yisro -) "the sons of the Keini, the father-in-law of Moshe."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "they will fight with us, and leave the land"? It should say 'and we will leave the land!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Aba bar Kahana):</span> This is like one who curses himself, but euphemistically attributes the curse to someone else.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE SLAVERY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "they put on him officers of Misim (taxes)"? It should say 'on them'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Tana d'Vei R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon):</span> They placed a mold (for making bricks) on Pharaoh's neck;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Yisrael would say 'I am too delicate to work', they would say 'you are not more delicate than Pharaoh!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Officers of Misim" - something that is Mesim (puts lordship over them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "in order to afflict him with their burdens"? It should say 'them'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They put the mold to afflict Pharaoh, in order to put burdens on Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav or Shmuel):</span> "He built Miskenos (storage) cities for Pharaoh" - they are Mesaknos (endanger) their owners;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav and Shmuel):</span> They Memaskenos (impoverish) their owners.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Anyone who builds waxes poor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav or Shmuel):</span> "Pisom and Ra'amses" - the real name is Pisom. It is called Ra'amses, for each bit that is built MisRoSeS (falls);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav and Shmuel):</span> The real name is Ra'amses. It is called Pisom, for each bit that is built is swallowed into the depths (Pi TehoM).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "like they afflict them, so he will increase and overflow"? It should say 'so they increased and overflowed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> Ru'ach ha'Kodesh says (to the Mitzriyim) that the more they afflict Yisrael, the more they will increase and overflow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>"Va'Yakutzu (they were disgusted) due to Bnei Yisrael" - Bnei Yisrael were like Kotzim (thorns) in their eyes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "They made Bnei Yisrael work b'Farech" - with a soft mouth (Peh Rach);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> It was with crushing labor (bi'Frichah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "They embittered their lives with harsh work in mortar and bricks" - first they worked with mortar and bricks. In the end, in all work in the field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> "All the work they made them do was b'Farech" - they made men do women's labors, and women do men's labors.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Elazar explained the previous "b'Farech" to mean with a soft mouth. He explains this "b'Farech" to mean with crushing labor.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>HOW CHILDREN WERE CONCEIVED AND BORN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Avira):</span> Yisrael were redeemed from Mitzrayim in the merit of the righteous women of that generation.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When they would go to draw water, Hash-m would send fish into their buckets; they would draw half water, half fish.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They would warm up one pot of fish and one of water. They would take them to their husbands in the field, wash and anoint their husbands, give them to eat and drink, and cohabit with them in ridges between the fields.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"If you will lie between the ridges..." in the merit of lying between the ridges, Yisrael merited the spoils of Mitzrayim - "dove's wings covered with silver, and its pinions with fine gold."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>When the women became pregnant, they came to their houses. When they were ready to deliver, they would go to the field, under the apple tree - "under the apple tree I aroused you (to leave the womb)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>"Those who gave birth to you did not cut your cord, you were not bathed in water to smooth you" - Hash-m would send from Heaven someone to clean and straighten the baby like a midwife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>He gathered for them two round 'loaves', one of oil, and one of honey - "He nursed him honey from the rock, and oil"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>When the Mitzriyim found out about the birth, they would come to kill the babies. Miraculously, the babies were swallowed into he ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The Mitzriyim brought cattle to plow the ground - "they plowed furrows on me."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>When the Mitzriyim left, the babies emerged from the ground like herbs - "I made you grow like the herbs of the field."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>After they grew up, they would come home in flocks - "You increased and grew and you came ba'Adi Adayim (adorned)" - we read this 'b'Edrei Adarim' (in flocks).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>When Hash-m revealed Himself at the splitting of the sea, they recognized Him first - "this is my G-d, and I will glorify Him."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE MIDWIVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav or Shmuel):</span> "Pharaoh said to the Hebrew midwives" - they were a woman and her daughter - Yocheved and Miryam;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav and Shmuel):</span> They were a daughter-in-law and her mother-in-law - Elisheva (Aharon's wife) and Yocheved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support (for the first opinion - Beraisa):</span> "Shifra" is Yocheved. She is called Shifra because she is Meshaperes (straightens) the baby. Also, she'Paru v'Ravu (Yisrael multiplied) in her days;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Pu'ah" is Miryam. She is called Pu'ah because she is Po'ah (amuses) the baby. Alternatively, she was Po'ah (spoke) with Ru'ach ha'Kodesh, and prophesized that her mother would give birth to a savior of Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Pharaoh told them "when you help the Hebrews to give birth... (you will see on the stone)" - what is the stone?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chanan):</span> Pharaoh gave them a great sign. When she is about to give birth, her thighs become as cold as stone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "I went to the potter's house; he was working on the stone."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a potter spreads his thighs and the stone wheel is in the middle, a woman giving birth spreads her thighs, and the baby is in the middle.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> "If it is a son, you will kill him" - Pharaoh gave them a great sign. If the baby is born facing the ground, it is a boy. If it faces up, it is a girl.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "The midwives feared Hash-m, and did not do as he (Pharaoh) spoke Aleihen (to them)" - (grammatically) it should say Lahen!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> The word Aleihen (connotes Bi'ah. It) hints that Pharaoh requested to have Bi'ah with the midwives, but they refused.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "And they kept the children alive" - not only they did not kill them, rather, they even supplied them with water and food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "The midwives told Pharaoh, the Hebrew women... (are Chayos)" - what does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It means that they are midwives.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Also a midwife needs a midwife when she herself gives birth!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Yisrael are compared to animals (who do not need midwives);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Yehudah is a young lion...", "Dan will be a snake"...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even though Yakov did not bless all of the Shevatim like animals, another verse says "Your mother is a female lion lying among the lions."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav or Shmuel):</span> "Because the midwives feared Hash-m, He made for them houses" - houses of Kehunah and Leviyah, which came from Aharon and Moshe;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav and Shmuel):</span> He made houses of kingship. David came from Miryam.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Azuvah died, and Kalev married Efras (Miryam), and she bore to him Chor";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"David is the son of an Efrati man."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>"Kalev, son of Chetzron fathered Azuvah (his) wife and Yeri'os. These are (the names of) her children - Yashar, Shovav and Ardon."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Kalev is not the son of Chetzron. He is the son of Yefuneh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His father was Chetzron. He is called ben Yefuneh, for he turned (Panah) from the counsel of the evil Meraglim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Another verse calls him the son of Kenaz - "Osni'el ben Kenaz, the brother of Kalev"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> He was a half-brother of Kenaz (they had the same mother).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Kalev is called "ha'Kenizi", not the son of Kenaz.</p>
