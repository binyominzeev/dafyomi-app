<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE POWER OF TORAH AND PRAYER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ilai bar Yevarchiyah):</span> If not for David's prayer, all of Yisrael would sell fat (a poor man's profession) - "Hash-m, give (the poor) wealth (and through this, honor)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ilai bar Yevarchiyah):</span> If not Chabakuk's prayer, Chachamim would be so poor that two Chachamim would wrap themselves in one cloak to learn - "... Hash-m, Your deeds (in the past, You avenged Yisrael's enemies) b'Kerev Shanim Chayehu (in the near future, renew them)" - we read this "b'Karov Shnayim (two close together, sustain them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ilai bar Yevarchiyah):</span> If two Chachamim walk on the road and do not converse in Torah, it is fitting that they be burned - "they were walking and speaking, and a chariot of fire." If not for speaking in Torah, they would be fitting to be burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ilai bar Yevarchiyah):</span> If two Chachamim live in the same city and do not learn nicely together, one will die and the other will be exiled - "to flee there, a murderer... without knowledge."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Knowledge is Torah - "My nation seemed to lack knowledge...  you forgot Toras Elokecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah, brei d'R. Chiya):</span> If a Chacham engages in Torah amidst financial hardship, his prayer is heard - "the nation will sit in Tziyon, in Yerushalayim they will not cry, Hash-m will be gracious to the sound of your cry, as soon as He hears, He will answer you... (this discusses those who learn, even though) Hash-m will give you sparse bread and water."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> He merits to be satiated by the Divine Presence - "your eyes will see your Teacher."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Chanina):</span> The curtain is not locked in front of him - "your Teacher will not separate from you."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE DECLINE AFTER THE <i>CHURBAN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yehoshua testified that after the Mikdash was destroyed...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Every day's curse is worse than the previous day's - "in the morning you will say 'if only it were evening!' In the evening you will say 'if only it were morning!'"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which morning does he long for?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He longs for the coming morning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He does not know if it will be better than now (the current evening)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he longs for the previous morning, for it was not as bad as now.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the curse keeps increasing this way, what sustains the world?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Kedushah said in the prayer "u'Va l'Tziyon", and "Amen Yehei Shmei Raba..." said in Kadish after Agadata, sustain the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"The land became very dark like the darkness of death, without orders" - if there would be orders of (Kedushos), light would emerge from the darkness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Dew does not descend for a Berachah, and fruits lost their taste...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> When Taharah ceased, fruits lost their taste and smell. When Ma'asros ceased, the fat of grain was lost.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav Huna found a fat, fragrant date. He wrapped it in his turban. His son Rabah was able to smell it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Huna was happy that his son was Tahor (and therefore was able to smell it). He gave the date to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Aba, the son of Rabah bar Rav Huna, came. Rabah took the date and gave it to his son.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna (to Rabah):</span> My son, you delighted me (because you are Tahor), and blunted my teeth (by showing me that you love your son more than you love me)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is like people say, 'a father mercies his son. The son mercies his own son!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav Acha bar Yakov raised his daughter's son, Yakov. When Yakov grew up, Rav Acha bar Yakov asked him to get him water to drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Yakov:</span> I am not your son (so I need not honor you)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is like people say, 'even though you raised me, I am not your son.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DECREES AND DECLINES FROM THE <i>CHURBAN </i>ONWARDS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> During the siege of Aspanyanus, Chachamim decreed against grooms' crowns and Eirus (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>During the siege of Titus, they decreed against brides' crowns and that a person should not teach his son Yevanis (Greek).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>During the last siege, they decreed that brides should not be carried in bridal canopies in the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>After R. Meir died, there was no one who could give parables;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>After ben Azai died, there was no one who learned unceasingly;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>After ben Zoma died, there was no one who could expound;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>After R. Akiva died, the honor of the Torah ceased;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>After R. Chanina ben Dosa died, there was no one of great deeds;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>After R. Yosi Katanta died, there were no saintly people;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He was called 'Katanta' because he was the smallest of the saintly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>After R. Yishmael ben Pavi died, the radiance of Kehunah ceased;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>After Rebbi died, humility and fear of sin ceased.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) (Rashi and others consider this to be part of the Mishnah):</span> R. Pinchas ben Ya'ir says, after the Mikdash was destroyed, the pious and people of lineage were ashamed. People of deeds were lowered, and the forceful people and talebearers overpowered;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>No one teaches Yisrael, no one requests mercy for us. We have no one to rely on, except our Father in Heaven!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Eliezer says, after the Mikdash was destroyed, Chachamim started to descend to be like teachers of children. Teachers of children became like heads of the Beis ha'Keneses; heads of the Beis ha'Keneses became like commoners; and commoners keep descending.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">49b----------------------------------------49b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>No one teaches Yisrael, no one requests mercy for us. We have no one to rely on, except our Father in Heaven!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Before Mashi'ach comes, brazenness will be rampant. The most honored people will be crooked (Rashi's text in Sanhedrin). (Even though) the vine will yield grapes, wine will be expensive. Most of the world will be ruled by heretics, and there is no rebuke;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The house of learning will be used for illicit Bi'ah. The Galil will be destroyed, the Gavlan will be desolate, those who lived on the border will roam from city to city without rest;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Chachmah of Chachamim will spoil, and those who fear sin will be despised. Truth will be hidden, youths will embarrass elders, and elders will stand in front of the small;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A son will disgrace his father, a daughter will stand up against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. A man's enemies are his household;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>The face (leaders) of the generation is like the face of a dog. A son is not ashamed of his father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We have no one to rely on, except our Father in Heaven!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>RESTRICTIONS ON WEDDINGS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Only a groom's crown of rock-salt colored with sulfur was forbidden, but not of myrtle and roses;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Even of myrtle and roses was forbidden, but not of reeds and sedge;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Levi):</span> Even of reeds and sedge was forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Levi's version of the Mishnah explicitly forbids even of reeds and sedge.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> And Eirus (was forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Eirus?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> It is a bell with one clapper.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rabah bar Rav Huna made a drum for his son. Rabah's father came and broke it, for it could be confused with a bell with one clapper.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Huna suggested that he make a drum on the mouth of a Kli, which would not be confused.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> During the siege of Titus, they decreed against brides' crowns...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a brides' crown?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> It is a gold head-plate with a picture of the city (Yerushalayim) on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> A bride's crown that is forbidden is a gold head-plate with a drawing of the city on it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may make a silk hat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> They decreed even against a groom's canopy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a red cloak set up like a dome, supported by gold plates.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> A groom's canopy (that is forbidden) is a red cloak set up like a dome. One may make a dome of wooden rings, and hang whatever he wants from it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE DECLINE AFTER THE <i>CHURBAN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not teach his son Yevanis...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When the Chashmonai kings fought each other, Hurkenus was outside Yerushalayim, and Aristoblus was inside. Every day, those inside sent coins over the wall in exchange for animals Kosher for the daily Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>There was an elder who knew Chachmas Yevanis. He used Chachmas Yevanis to tell the besiegers that they would not prevail as long as the Avodah in the Mikdash persists.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The next day, the besiegers sent a swine in place of lambs. When it was lifted halfway up the wall, it dug its claw into the wall; Eretz Yisrael shook 400 Parsa'os (about 1600 kilometers).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>At that time, Chachamim cursed anyone who will raise pigs or teach his son Chachmas Yevanis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>That year, (the besiegers destroyed the crops near Yerushalayim, so) they needed to bring the Omer from Gagos Tzerifim (a town near the coast), and the two loaves (of Shavuos) from the valley of Ein Socher. (l'Chatchilah, they should be brought from close to Yerushalayim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rebbi said that in Eretz Yisrael, one should not speak Sursi. He should speak Hebrew or Yevanis!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Yosef said that in Bavel, one should not speak Aramis. He should speak Hebrew or Parsi!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The decree was against Chachmas Yevanis. This is not regular Yevanis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is Chachmas Yevanis really forbidden?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Half of the 1000 children of R. Gamliel's house learned (only) Torah; and the other half learned (also) Chachmas Yevanis!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was permitted to R. Gamliel's house, for they were close to the king.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who cuts his hair like the Nochrim transgresses 'going in the ways of the Emori';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This was permitted to R. Gamliel's house, for they were close to the king.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Being close to the king also was a reason to permit learning Chachmas Yevanis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> During the last siege, they decreed that brides should not go in bridal canopies in the city...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim permitted this, for modesty.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> After R. Yochanan ben Zakai died, Chachmah ceased.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> After R. Eliezer died, the Sefer Torah was hidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After R. Yehoshua died, counsel ceased;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>After R. Akiva died, the arms of the Torah ceased and the wells of Chachmah were stopped up;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>After R. Elazar ben Azaryah died, the crown of Chachmah ceased;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is because the crown of Chachamim is their wealth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>After R. Chanina ben Dosa died, there was no one of great deeds;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>After R. Yosi Katanta died, there were no saintly people;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He was called 'Katanta' because he was the smallest of the saintly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>After Ben Azai died, there was no one who learned unceasingly;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>After Ben Zoma died, there was no one who could expound;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>After R. Shimon ben Gamliel died, locusts came and distress increased;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>After Rebbi died, troubles multiplied.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> After Rebbi died, humility and fear of sin ceased.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Do not teach that humility ceased. I am around!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Do not teach that fear of sin ceased. I am around!</p>
