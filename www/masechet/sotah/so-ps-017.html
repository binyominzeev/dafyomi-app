<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WRITING THE <i>MEGILAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(Mishnah - R. Meir) He (the Kohen) starts writing the scroll (that will be erased into the water) from "if a man did not lie with you... since you strayed under your husband."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He omits "the Kohen imposes an oath on her." He writes "Hash-m should make you a (means for people to) curse and swear... The cursing water should come into your innards, to make the stomach swell and the thigh fall." He does not write "the woman says Amen, Amen."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi says, he does not interrupt (i.e. he does not skip in the middle).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, he writes only "Hash-m should make you a (means for people to) curse and swear... The cursing water should come into your innards..." He does not write "the woman says Amen, Amen."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> The Tana'im argue about how to expound "the Kohen will write ha'Alos ha'Elu (these curses) in the Sefer":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir holds that "Alos (curses)" are the (explicit) curses. The letter Hei (ha'Alos) includes curses that are inferred from Berachos (i.e. if the conditions for the Berachos are not true, curses result);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Elu (these)" excludes the curses in Sefer Devarim. The Hei in "ha'Elu" excludes directives ("the Kohen imposes an oath...") and acceptances ("the woman says Amen, Amen").</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi learns like R. Meir, with one exception. The word "Es" teaches that he writes directives and acceptances;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Meir does not expound "Es."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah holds that the entire verse comes to exclude:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Alos" are the (explicit) curses. The Hei in "ha'Alos" excludes curses inferred from Berachos. "Elu" excludes the curses in Devarim. The Hei in "ha'Elu" excludes directives and acceptances.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Meir say that the Hei in ha'Alos includes, but the Hei in ha'Elu excludes?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Alos" includes, so its Hei also includes. Elu excludes, so its Hei also excludes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (How can R. Meir include curses inferred from Berachos?) R. Meir holds that we do not infer the positive from the negative!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Tanchum):</span> (The letters 'Hei' and 'Ches' are interchangeable.) The Berachah "Hinaki (you will be clean)" may be read 'Chanki' (you will choke).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW WE MERITED THE <i>MITZVAH </i>OF <i>SOTAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Akiva):</span> When a husband and wife merit, the Divine Presence is between them. (There is a Yud in Ish, and a Hei in Ishah. These comprise the shortened form of Hash-m's name.) If they do not merit, fire consumes them (the letters of Hash-m's name depart, and only Aleph and Shin, Esh, remains).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The fire that consumes the wife is worse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Esh is part of the word Ishah, without intervening letters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Why did the Torah say to use soil for a Sotah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If she is innocent, she will merit having children like Avraham, who said "I am soil and ashes." If she is guilty, she will return to the soil she was created from.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A reward for Avraham's saying "I am soil and ashes" was that his descendants merited the Mitzvos of ashes of the Parah Adumah and the soil of Sotah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Rava omit the soil of covering the blood (of a slaughtered bird or Chayah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Mitzvah has no direct benefit (i.e. above the reward Hash-m pays for fulfilling it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A reward for Avraham's saying "(I will not take from Melech Sedom) from a thread to a shoelace" was that his descendants merited two Mitzvos: the thread of Techeiles (wool died blue, on Tzitzis) and the strap of Tefilin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>We know the direct benefit of Tefilin - "all the nations will see that Hash-m's name is called upon you";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ha'Gadol):</span> This refers to the head Tefilin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What direct benefit do we get from the thread of Techeiles?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Meir) Question:</span> Why did the Torah say to use a thread specifically of Techeiles?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (If one fulfills the Mitzvah is Techeiles, it is as if he received the Divine Presence.) The color Techeiles resembles the sea; the sea resembles the sky; the sky is like Hash-m's throne of glory - "they saw (the honor of) Hash-m, and under His feet, like the sapphire brick, as clear like the sky", and it says "the sapphire brick resembles the throne."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE WRITING OF THE SCROLL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He does not write on a tablet, nor on papyrus, nor on a hide that was not tanned, only on a Megilah (a proper parchment), for it says "in a Sefer."</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">17b----------------------------------------17b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He does not write with sap, vitriol nor any dye that is absorbed into parchment, only with ink.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"He will blot out" - the writing must be erasable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rava):</span> If Megilas Sotah was written at night, it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>We learn this from a Gezeirah Shavah "Torah-Torah." It says here "the Kohen will do this whole Torah (procedure) to her", and it says "according to the Torah that they will instruct you, and the Mishpat (law)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like Mishpat (Rashi - monetary laws; Tosfos - capital cases, like a Chacham who rules unlike the Great Sanhedrin) must be during the day, also the writing of Megilas Sotah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If it was written out of order, it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>We learn from "he will write these curses" - like (the order in which) they are written (in the Torah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If he wrote it before she accepted the oath, it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>It says "he imposes the oath on her", and afterwards it says "he will write."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If he wrote it like a letter (without lines to ensure straight writing), it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>It says "a Sefer."</p>
