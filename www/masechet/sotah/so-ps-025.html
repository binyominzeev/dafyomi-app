<p class="dedicationbox">12th CYCLE DEDICATION<br>SOTAH 23-25 - A week of study material has been dedicated by Mrs. Rita Grunberger of Queens, N.Y., in loving memory of her husband, Reb Yitzchok Yakov (Irving) ben Eliyahu Grunberger. Irving Grunberger helped many people quietly in an unassuming manner and is dearly missed by all who knew him. His Yahrzeit is 10 Sivan. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IMMODEST BEHAVIOR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Shmuel can hold even like R. Yoshiyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yoshiyah needed a verse to teach that a Shomeres Yavam drinks. This implies that she is not like a full wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a wife was Overes Al Das (Yehudis, i.e. she deviated from the modest ways of Bnos Yisrael), does she forfeit her Kesuvah even if she was not warned?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since she acted immodestly, no warning is needed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps we must warn her. Perhaps she will correct her behavior!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> An Arusah or a Shomeres Yavam does not drink and does not get a Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> They must be warned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does the warning accomplish?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If she is secluded, she forfeits her Kesuvah. (This implies that she does not forfeit her Kesuvah for immodest behavior unless she was warned.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Abaye):</span> No. The warning causes that seclusion will forbid her to her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Rav Papa):</span> The warning is in order to make her drink after Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One cannot warn his Arusah to make her drink during Eirusin, but he can warn her to make her drink after Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava - Mishnah):</span> The following do not drink or receive a Kesuvah: a widow married to a Kohen Gadol, a divorcee or Chalutzah married to a regular Kohen, a Mamzeres or Nesinah married to a Yisrael, or a Bas Yisrael married to a Mamzer or Nasin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> They do not drink, but they may be warned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does the warning accomplish?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>You cannot say that seclusion will forbid her to her husband. She is already forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, if she is secluded, she forfeits her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Yehudah of Diskarta):</span> No. The warning causes that seclusion will (permanently) forbid her to the (suspected) Bo'el;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Just like a Sotah is forbidden to her husband, she is forbidden to the Bo'el.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Chanina of Sura - Mishnah):</span> Beis Din can warn the wife of a man who became deaf or insane, or was imprisoned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She may not drink. She is warned, so that if she is secluded, she forfeits her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> She does not forfeit her Kesuvah without warning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't the other Amora'im resolve the question from our Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One could distinguish. The wife of a deaf, insane, or imprisoned man does not fear her husband, so we are not as quick to punish her for immodesty.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May a husband remain married to a wife who is Overes Al Das?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps he may decide whether or not he minds;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since most men object to immodest behavior, he may not choose!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> Beis Din can warn the wife of a man that became deaf, or insane, or was imprisoned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If her husband may remained married to her, Beis Din would not warn her, lest she become forbidden, and he would have wanted to keep her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, he may remain married to her, but we assume that he would not want to remain married to a wife who is Overes Al Das.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CANCELLING A WARNING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a man warned his wife, can he cancel the warning?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If warning depends on what bothers the husband, he is no longer adamant;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since he initially warned her, he cannot retract!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> Beis Din can warn the wife of a man that became deaf, or insane, or was imprisoned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a husband could cancel a warning, Beis Din would not warn her, lest he cancel it. (This would be a disgrace to Beis Din!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, a husband can cancel a warning. We are not concerned that he will cancel it, for a person usually agrees with decisions of Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> Two Chachamim are sent to accompany the Sotah and her husband to Yerushalayim, lest he have Bi'ah with her on the way.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he can cancel his warning, there is no need for Chachamim (to ensure that he not have Bi'ah with her). He can cancel the warning and have Bi'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is the purpose of Chachamim, to tell him that he should cancel the warning before he has Bi'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yoshiyah, citing Chachamim of Yerushalayim):</span> A husband can pardon his warning. The Great Sanhedrin can pardon a Chacham who rules unlike them. Parents can pardon a rebellious son;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of the south):</span> A husband and parents can pardon, but the Sanhedrin cannot, lest disputes increase in Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> This teaches that a husband can pardon his warning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rav Acha and Ravina argued about whether pardon works only before seclusion, or even after seclusion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (for the former opinion - Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> A Kal va'Chomer shows that the husband (of a Sotah) is trusted (to be secluded with her):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nidah is Chayavei Kerisus, yet a man is trusted to be secluded with his wife when she is Nidah. Sotah is only a Lav, all the more so he is trusted to be alone with her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> You cannot learn from Nidah, for she will become permitted to him again. A Sotah might not become permitted to him again!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If pardon worked after seclusion, also a Sotah could become permitted again. He could pardon the warning!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> This teaches that pardon does not work after seclusion.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WOMEN WHO DO NOT DRINK</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If her husband died before she drank (she collects her Kesuvah...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of the argument?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beis Shamai hold that a document (in our case, the Kesuvah) destined to be collected is considered to be collected already. (If there is a Safek and no one brings proof, the bearer collects.) Beis Hillel say, it is not considered to be collected already.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">25b----------------------------------------25b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If a man married Me'uberes Chaveiro...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> They argue only about a sterile woman, or one too old to have children. All agree that an Ailonis does not drink and does not get her Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"(If) she is vindicated, she will bear seed" - she drinks only if she is able to bear seed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1):</span> (The question is from the end of this long Beraisa.) If a man warned his Arusah or Shomeres Yavam, if she was secluded before Nisu'in, she does not drink and does not get her Kesuvah;</p>
