<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MEASURE FOR MEASURE (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>She put mascara on her eyes. Therefore, her eyes bulge out;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>She braided her hair. Therefore, the Kohen unbraids her hair;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>With her finger, she beckoned for him to come. Therefore, her fingernails fall off;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>She girded herself with a ribbon. Therefore, the Kohen ties a Mitzri rope above her breasts;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>She stuck out her thigh for him. Therefore, her thigh falls off;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>She supported him on her stomach. Therefore, her stomach swells;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>She fed him kingly delights. Therefore, her Korban is (barley, which is normally) animal food;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>She gave him good wine to drink in elegant Kelim. Therefore, the Kohen gives her bitter water to drink in a lowly earthenware Kli;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>She acted covertly. Therefore "He (Hash-m) who dwells hidden" turned His attention to punish her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"The eye of a Bo'el guards the night, saying, no eye will see me."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also, she acted covertly, therefore Hash-m publicized about her - "one who conceals his hateful deeds in darkness, his evil is revealed in the Tzibur."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PUNISHMENT OF THE NATIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since "one by one makes a (big) sum" shows that every Perutah joins to make a big liability, why do we need "Kol Se'on So'en b'Ra'ash"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that Hash-m punishes Midah k'Neged Midah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why do we need "b'Sase'ah You send discipline"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches like Rav Chinena:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Chinena bar Papa):</span> Hash-m does not punish a nation until it is worthy to be sent (for destruction) - "b'Sase'ah You send discipline."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava taught that the three cups (in the wine-steward's dream) of punishment of Mitzrayim allude to one in Moshe's era, one in Pharaoh-Necho's era (when Nevuchadnetzar conquered Mitzrayim), and one that they will drink with the other nations.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the original Mitzriyim are gone, and new inhabitants of Mitzrayim suffer the latter two cups!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Minyamin, the Mitzri covert was my colleague, a Talmid of R. Akiva. He said 'I am a first generation Mitzri (convert). I married a first generation Mitzris. I will marry my son to a second generation Mitzris, so that my grandchildren will be permitted to marry Yisre'elim.' (I.e. there were still real Mitzriyim long after Moshe's era!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, R. Chinena taught that Hash-m does not punish a king until he is sent - "b'Sase'ah You send discipline."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ameimar):</span> R. Chinena expounded "I, Hash-m, did not repeat, and You, Bnei Yakov, I did not finish" - I did not strike a nation twice, and I did not finish off Bnei Yakov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"I will finish My arrows on them" - My arrows will finish, and they (Bnei Yisrael) will not be finished.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> Hash-m does not mete out punishment due to a person until his measure (of sin) is complete - "When his desire is filled, it will be harsh for him."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chinena bar Papa):</span> "Tzadikim, exult (in song) in Hash-m; praise is Na'avah (fitting) for the straight" - we read this like Naveh Sehilah (they will praise Him about the dwellings they built);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This refers to Moshe and David. Their enemies did not rule over (benefit from) the edifices of Moshe and David.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>David prepared the Beis ha'Mikdash. (When Bavel conquered, "its gates sank in the ground."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Moshe erected the Mishkan. When the first Mikdash was built, the Mishkan was hidden, its planks, hooks, interior beams, pillars and sockets.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where were they hidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> They were hidden under the tunnels of the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SEEKING WHAT IS FORBIDDEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Sotah put her eyes on what was not fitting for her. She did not get what she wanted, and she lost what she had;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Anyone who seeks what is not fitting for him does not get what he wants, and loses what he had.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">9b----------------------------------------9b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The serpent put its eyes on what was not fitting for it (Chavah). It did not get what it wanted, and it lost what it had;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m intended that it would be king over the animals. Now, it is cursed more than all the animals;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Hash-m intended that it would walk erect. Now, it goes on its belly;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Hash-m intended that it would eat human food. Now, it eats soil;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>It intended to kill Adam and marry Chavah. Now, Hash-m put enmity between it and Chavah, and between its descendants and hers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We also find that each of the following did not get what he wanted, and lost what he had - Kayin, Korach, Bilam, Doeg, Achitofel, Gechazi, Avshalom, Adoniyahu, Uziyahu, and Haman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She started to sin with her thigh...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that her thigh is stricken first?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Hash-m will make your thigh fall and your stomach swell."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> It also says "her stomach will swell and her thigh will fall"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The thigh is cursed first. The limbs are stricken according to the order in which the water enters her, the stomach before the thigh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Also regarding the curse it says "to make the stomach swell and the thigh fall"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is not the curse. Rather, the Kohen tells her in what order her limbs will be stricken, lest people say that the water did not kill her (if she did not die the way the Torah says).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MIDAH K'NEGED MIDAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Shimshon went after his eyes, therefore, Pelishtim gouged out his eyes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Avshalom was haughty about his hair, therefore he was hung by his hair;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Because he had Bi'ah with 10 concubines of his father, 10 spears were cast into him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Because he deceived three hearts, i.e. his father's, Beis Din's, and Yisrael's, three staves were cast into his heart.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Hash-m also rewards measure for measure.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Miryam waited a short time for Moshe (when he was put in the river). Therefore, all of Yisrael waited seven days for her (until her Tzara'as was cured).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Yosef merited to bury his father, and he was the greatest of his brothers. He merited that Moshe engaged in his burial!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Moshe merited to take Yosef's bones, and he was the greatest in Yisrael. He merited to be buried by Hash-m alone!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Hash-m engages in the burial of all Tzadikim - "your righteousness will go before you, the honor of Hash-m will gather you."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Shimshon rebelled with his eyes - "take her (the Pelishti woman) for me, for she is straight in my eyes." Therefore, Pelishtim gouged out his eyes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "It was from Hash-m" (that he desired her)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He chose the one who was nice in his eyes. (Maharsha - Hash-m led him in the path that he desired.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> The beginning of Shimshon's downfall was in Azah, therefore he was stricken in Azah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He first took a Pelishti wife in Timnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The beginning of his downfall was in Azah. (Rashi - there, he had Bi'as Znus; Maharsha - his wife in Timnah converted.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>SHIMSHON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Delilah was fit to be called by her name. She Dildelah (uprooted) his strength, his heart, and his deeds.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She uprooted his strength - "his strength left him."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She uprooted his heart - "she saw that he had told her all his heart."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>She uprooted his deeds, for the Divine Presence left him - "he did not know that Hash-m had abandoned him."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did she know that he had told her all his heart?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chanin):</span> Truth is recognizable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> Shimshon said "I am a Nazir Elokim" - she knew that a Tzadik would not say Hash-m's name in vain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "She pained him with her words every day, va'Te'altzehu" - what does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> She would separate from him during the marital act (at the moment when his desire was greatest).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> (The angel told Mano'ach's wife) "... do not eat anything Tamei" - what is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Until now, did she eat Tamei food?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions (R. Yitzchak):</span> He forbade her to eat things forbidden to a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> "Hash-m split the gum in the jaw" (and water came out for Shimshon to drink) - because Shimshon desired something Tamei (Pelishti women), Hash-m made his life dependent on something Tamei (a donkey).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> "Va'Techal (began) the spirit of Hash-m" - Chalsah (took effect) the prophecy of Yakov "Dan (Shimshon's Shevet) will be a serpent on the road."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> "Lifa'amo (to arouse him) in the camp of Dan" - the Divine Presence went before him like a clapper of a Pa'amon (bell);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says here "Lifa'amo", and it says about the Kohen Gadol's robe "Pa'amon v'Rimon."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> "Between Tzor'ah and "Eshta'ol" - these are two great mountains. Shimshon uprooted them and ground them on each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> "He Yachel (began) to save Yisrael" - the oath of Avimelech, "if you will lie to my child or grandchild", was Huchal (the Pelishtim profaned it).</p>
