<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE PERIOD OF <i>HACHRAZAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> The Hachrazah of orphans is 30 days. The Hachrazah of Hekdesh is 60 days;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, the Hachrazah of orphans is 60 days. The Hachrazah of Hekdesh is 90 days;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, the Hachrazah of both of these is 60 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda citing Avimi):</span> The Halachah is, the Hachrazah of orphans is 60 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Chiya bar Avin taught this to Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Did you say 30 or 60? Was this for orphans or Hekdesh? Is this like R. Meir or R. Yehudah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> I said 60. It is for orphans. This is like R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> R. Meir says that the Hachrazah of orphans is 30 days!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> Avimi lashed Rav Chisda greatly until he properly understood this:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(R. Meir holds that) if the Hachrazah is every day (except for Shabbos), it lasts for 30 days. If it is only on Mondays and Thursdays, it lasts for 60 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even though there are only 18 Mondays and Thursdays in 60 days, since the Hachrazah is over a long period, people hear about it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN DO WE SELL ORPHANS' PROPERTY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> Beis Din will (process a claim to) collect from orphans' property only to pay off a loan (from a Nochri) on interest. (In this discussion, whenever Amora'im say "orphans," they refer to minors. Some say that some of the Tana'ic teachings apply also to adult orphans.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> They collect only for a loan on interest or to pay a Kesuvah (because paying the Kesuvah exempts the orphans from feeding the widow).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Rav Asi hold that we do not pay a Kesuvah from their property?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She works in exchange for her food. (The orphans do not save through paying her Kesuvah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan says, since her work might be less than the food she eats, it is better for the orphans to pay her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Hachrazah of orphans is 30 days. The Hachrazah of Hekdesh is 60 days. They announce in the morning and evening.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the property being sold?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is to pay a Nochri creditor. (He lent to their father on interest.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He would not consent to wait 30 days! (Rashi - he would not consent without interest. Surely we would not agree to pay additional interest for 30 days of Hachrazah, lest we not find anyone willing to pay more for the field than was offered on the first day.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is to pay a Yisrael creditor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Surely, this is not due to interest. A Yisrael may not collect interest from orphans (or any other Yisrael)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan can explain that it is to pay a Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can Rav Asi explain it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> According to R. Yochanan, why should we delay paying the Kesuvah? The widow definitely eats, and perhaps we will not receive more for the field!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, she demanded payment of the Kesuvah in Beis Din;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Once a widow demands payment of her Kesuvah in Beis Din, she is no longer fed from the orphans' property (even before she is paid).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If she is no longer fed, we should not sell the orphans' property to pay her (until they grow up)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since we recognized her claim in the beginning (and stopped feeding her due to it), we recognize it in the end (and we help her to collect. Tosfos Yom Tov - if not, no widow would demand her Kesuvah before the orphans grow up!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>We still have not answered for Rav Asi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, it is to pay a Nochri creditor. The case is, he agreed to follow the laws of Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he should not charge interest!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He agreed to follow the laws of Yisrael regarding Hachrazah, but not regarding interest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We collect only Ziburis (lowest quality land) from orphans' property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the property being sold?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is to pay a Nochri creditor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He would not consent to wait!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is to pay a Yisrael creditor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Surely, this is not due to interest!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan can explain that it is to pay a Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can Rav Asi explain it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> According to R. Yochanan, why does it say that we collect only Ziburis <i>from orphans' property</i>? A Kesuvah is collected from Ziburis even from her husband!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is R. Meir, who says that a divorcee collecting her Kesuvah from her husband receives Beinonis (middle quality land).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We still have not answered for Rav Asi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, it is to pay a Nochri creditor. The case is, he agreed to follow the laws of Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he should not charge interest!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He agreed to follow the laws of Yisrael regarding Hachrazah, but not regarding interest.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN DO WE SELL ORPHANS' PROPERTY? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (They announce... ) whether the money will be used to pay a Kesuvah or a creditor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We can explain why a creditor is paid, like above. (We pay a Nochri, due to interest);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like R. Yochanan, who says that we pay a Kesuvah from orphans' property. It is unlike Rav Asi!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, her (ex-)husband admitted (just before he died) that he did not give her money for the Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This suggests another answer to Questions (2:e) and (2:l) above.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The case (in which we announce orphans' property) is when their father admitted that he did not give her money for the Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Mereimar collected a Kesuvah for a divorcee from orphans' property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Rav Asi says that we sell only due to interest, and R. Yochanan adds to this only a Kesuvah due to food;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan would not pay a Kesuvah to a divorcee, for she is not fed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> We explain R. Yochanan differently. We pay a Kesuvah from orphans' property due to Chen (to find favor. This applies even to a divorcee. Rashi - we make it readily collectable, to encourage women to get married. R. Chananel - this encourages men to marry women (who are entitled to a Kesuvah from previous marriage). Aruch - confidence of payment causes women to faithfully serve their husbands. R. Gershom - this causes men to be pleased with their wives.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> At first, I never collected from orphans' property;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After I heard Rav Huna cite Rav to say that orphans who consume others' (i.e. creditors') property should follow their father (i.e. die), I collect from their property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Initially, why didn't he collect?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> Paying a creditor is a Mitzvah. Minors are exempt from Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Perhaps the father gave money (Rashi - just before he died) to his creditor (for the debt, and did not take back the document).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these answers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The father admitted (just before he died) that he still owes, or if he was excommunicated for not paying and died in Niduy. (Had he paid, he would have done so in Beis Din so they would end the Niduy.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>The Halachah follows Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (They announce... ) whether the money will be used to pay a Kesuvah or a creditor.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question 3:l, Amud A - Rava):</span> We do not collect from orphans' property, lest the father paid the debt and received a receipt (but did not take back the document).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> We are not concerned for a receipt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In order to collect a Kesuvah in the absence of her husband, a woman must swear (that she did not already receive any part of it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Acha Sar ha'Birah):</span> A case occurred in which R. Yitzchak Nafcha said that we do not collect a regular debt from someone in his absence. We collect only a Kesuvah, due to Chen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rava citing Rav Nachman):</span> Even a creditor may collect in the absence of the borrower.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If we are concerned for a receipt, he should not collect!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Rav Nachman's law is an enactment, lest people borrow money and go overseas (knowing that the lender will not be able to collect).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE HALACHAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah is, we do not collect from orphans' property;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If the father said "give," we give;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said "(give) <i>this</i> field" or "<i>this</i> Maneh (100 Zuz)," we give it. We need not appoint an overseer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said "(give) <i>a</i> field" or "<i>a</i> Maneh," we appoint an overseer to pick the worst field (or coins) to give.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Neharda'a):</span> We always (Tosfos - even if he said "this field" or "this Maneh") deal with the case and appoint an overseer (to verify if it indeed should be given);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The only exception is when witnesses testify that the father stole a field. Then, we return it. we do not appoint an overseer (to investigate whether or not it was really stolen), we do not suspect that witnesses lie.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> We never process a claim to collect orphans' property, like Rava said;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we (improperly) accepted the claim, we appoint an overseer, for Chachamim of Neharda'i say that we always process a claim and appoint an overseer, except for when witnesses testify that the field was stolen; for we do not suspect witnesses.</p>
