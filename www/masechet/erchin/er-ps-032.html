<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>An enactment was needed to allow the seller to return the money to the buyer against his will. Normally, this does not work. (Tosfos - if it did work, without any enactment the seller could ask a friend to acquire on behalf of the buyer!)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Yehudah) "Bayis" teaches only (that the law of Bayis Ir Chomah applies to) houses;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> They argue only about Chulsis and Metzulah (places unfit for farming for they are rocky, sandy, right by the river or full of water, but R. Meir agrees that fields are not included).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the roofs of the houses comprise the wall of the city, or if the wall is not from the days of Yehoshua bin Nun, it is not considered a walled city;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A walled city must have (at least) three Chatzeros (courtyards), each of which has (at least) two houses;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "Chomah" excludes a wall of houses. "Soviv" excludes Tiverya, for in one direction it is guarded by the sea, and not a wall;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Eliezer bar Yosi says, "Asher Lo Chomah" teaches that even if it currently does not have a wall, but once it did, it is considered a walled city.

<div class="bbbline">32b----------------------------------------32b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> All the cities until Gamla (but not north of it) in Galil are walled cities, and also all the cities (going eastward) until Gedud in Ever ha'Yarden, and until Chadid, Onah and Yerushalayim in Yehudah (Rashi. R. Gershom - any city (with a wall from the days of Yehoshua) no smaller than Gamla in Galil, Gedud in Ever ha'Yarden... (each had three Chatzeros of two houses each) is considered a walled city.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Gamla in Galil excludes a different Gamla (in a different region), and likewise concerning the other cities listed;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> They are like Yerushalayim, which was surrounded by a wall from the days of Yehoshua;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They are unlike Yerushalayim regarding Bayis Ir Chomah, for a house is not Chalut in Yerushalayim, but it is in the other cities.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi) Question:</span> Why does our Mishnah list only some walled cities?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It lists only the cities that the exiles who returned (from Bavel with Ezra) found and were Mekadesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Kedushah (of walled cities, from the days of Yehoshua) had ceased when the Kedushah of Eretz Yisrael ceased (at the time of the Churban).</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It lists only the cities that the returning exiles found and were Mekadesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> (The end of this Beraisa says that) they did not need to be Mekadesh them!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, it lists cities known to have had a wall.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>All laws of walled cities apply also to any other city for which there is a tradition that it had a wall from the days of Yehoshua, because the first Kedushah was permanent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Tana'im of these two Beraisos argue about R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi's opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The latter Beraisa is really R. Elazar b'Rebbi Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> "Asher Lo Chomah" teaches that even if now it does not have a wall, but once it did, it is considered a walled city (because the first Kedushah remains).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason for the opinion that the first Kedushah was not permanent?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - Question:</span> "Va'Ya'asu Chol ha'Kahal ha'Shavim Min ha'Shevi Sukos va'Yeshvu ba'Sukos Ki Lo Asu mi'Mei Yeshu'a bin Nun Ken... va'Tehi Simchah Gedolah Me'od" - is it possible that David (nor anyone else until Ezra) did not make Sukos?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the verse equates the second entrance (of Ezra and the exiles to Eretz Yisrael) to the first entrance (in the days of Yehoshua);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Just like Yisrael <i>started</i> to count Shemitah and Yovel cycles and were Mekadesh Batei Ir Chomah at the time of the first entrance, also at the time of the second. (<i>This</i> had not been done since the days of Yehoshua.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It also says "v'Hevi'acha... El Eretz Asher Yorshu Avosecha vi'Rishta," equating your inheritance (in the days of Ezra) to the first (in the days of Yehoshua):</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Just like (the cycles of) Shemitah and Yovel and (Kidush) Batei Ir Chomah began during the first inheritance, also during the second.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>The opinion that the first Kedushah was permanent explains "va'Ya'asu... Sukos... Ki Lo Asu" to teach that they asked Hash-m to remove the Yetzer ha'Ra for idolatry. (He agreed.) Ezra's merit protected over Yisrael like a Sukah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The verse alludes to a criticism of Yehoshua that he did not request this. This is the only place where his name is written Yeshu'a, without a "Hei."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Moshe is not criticized for not requesting this. He did not have the merit of Eretz Yisrael to help.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does this opinion expound "... Asher Yorshu Avosecha vi'Rishta"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (It addresses the exiles that returned.) Since your ancestors inherited (and were Mekadesh) Eretz Yisrael, you inherit it. (It is already Kodesh. you need not be Mekadesh it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We said that Yisrael started to count Shemitah and Yovel cycles at the time of the second entrance;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Yovel ceased when Shevet Reuven, Gad and half of Menasheh were exiled. All the more so it should not have applied in the days of Ezra, for (all the Shevatim had been exiled, and) only a minority returned - "Kol ha'Kahal k'Echad Arba Ribo... " (42,360)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Yovel ceased when Reuven (and Gad... ) was (were) exiled. "U'Kerasem Deror ba'Aretz l'Chol Yoshveha" applies only when all its inhabitants (Bnei Yisrael) are in Eretz Yisrael, but not when (even) a minority (of Shevatim) have been exiled!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Yovel applies if all are in Eretz Yisrael, even if they are not in the right places, e.g. Binyamin dwells in the portion of Yehudah and vice-versa!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "L'Chol Yoshveha" teaches that they must be properly settled, and not mixed up.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Yisrael counted Yovel cycles in order to be Mekadesh Shemitah in the right time. (Every Yovel year delays the next Shemitah by one year.)</p></div>
