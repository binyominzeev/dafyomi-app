<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the Erech of an elderly woman (10 Sela'im) a full third of that a middle-aged woman (age 20-60, whose Erech is 30), whereas that of an elderly man (15 Sela'im) is less than a third of a middle-aged man (50 Sela'im)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Chizkiyah):</span> This attests to the saying, an old man in the house is a burden (or useless), an old woman in the house is a treasure.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said "my weight is Alai (upon me to give)," he gives his weight in silver or gold (to Hekdesh);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A case occurred in which Yarmatya's mother said "my daughter's weight is Alai." She went to Yerushalayim and gave her weight in gold.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If one said "the weight of my Yad is Alai":</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah says to estimate this we fill a barrel with water. He inserts his arm until his elbow (Tosfos; Rashi - underarm), displacing water. He removes his arm. We put donkey meat (with bones and sinews; its density resembles that of human flesh) inside until the barrel is full. Their weight equals the weight of his hand. (Rambam - we weigh the meat after filling the barrel; Tosfos - we must do so beforehand, lest the meat absorb water).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> (Even though the <i>total</i> amount of flesh, bones and sinews is the same,) surely there is more (or less) flesh of the donkey than in the arm (and it is compensated for by less (or more) donkey bones and sinews) - since they have different densities, the calculation is imprecise!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rather, we estimate how much the hand weighs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does "He gives silver or gold" mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> If he specified to give silver, he gives silver. If he specified to give gold, he gives gold.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is the inference. If he did not specify, he may give anything (normally sold by weight in that place).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, some people weigh it, and others sell it by volume;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that since not everyone weighs it, it is not permitted. Rachbah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, after weighing it, the seller gives an extra two or three (for free);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that since they give extra, it is as if they are not sold by weight. Rav Papa teaches that this is not so.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated. It means as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Noder is wealthy, even if he did not specify, we estimate what is appropriate for him to give;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one said "my height is Alai," he must give a (thick,) unbendable rod of his height (of silver or gold or anything weighed, according to the above rules);</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Tana'im argue about this.) Rav Yehudah holds like R. Akiva;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> If Reuven sold his house to Shimon, Shimon does not acquire the pit and cistern, even though Reuven wrote "the depth and height";</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Since they are not sold even if he does not mention them, he mentioned them to keep something else for himself, i.e. a path;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of answer:</span> Here also, the extra word "full" teaches that it may be bendable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions:</span> What is the law in the following cases? (R. Gershom - we ask whether the following are Nedarim. We explain Rashi and Tosfos according to Yad Binyamin.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He said "Omdi Alai." (Rashi - does this connote a rod of his height? (Perhaps if not, it refers to plate equal to the area he occupies when he stands - <b>PF</b>) Tosfos - surely he must give a rod of his height. Must it be unbendable, or does it suffice if it can stand? Each coming question depends on the previous one, i.e. if the previous one must be unbendable, all the more so what follows it.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He said "Rachbi Alai." (Rashi - does this connote a rod as long as his width (right to left), or a rod of this thickness? Tosfos - surely, it must be as long as his width. May it be bendable, or must it be unbendable, just like one cannot bend his width?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He said "Yeshivasi Alai." (Do we measure from his head until his seat? Or, does he refer to his full height, just he may give a bendable rod, just like he is bent when sitting?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>He said "Ovi Alai"? (This is like "Rachbi," just we consider his thickness from front to back.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>These questions are not resolved. (Rambam - therefore, one must give so much that he is sure that he did not intend to give more.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said "the weight of my Yad is Alai"...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R.

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A verse suggests (but does not prove) that the density of donkey meat resembles that of human flesh - "Asher Besar Chamorim Besaram."</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This teaches that the ankle extends until the bottom of the foot. If not, it itself would be considered "me'Al Raglo," and the shin would be me'Al me'Al, and Pasul!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> This is like the estimation for damage. (We consider how much one would pay to buy him now (for a slave), and how much one would have paid when he had an arm.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - Objection (Abaye):</span> Regarding damage, he truly is missing an arm. Even our (current) estimation of his original value is deflated (since he is disgraced in people's eyes);</p></div>
