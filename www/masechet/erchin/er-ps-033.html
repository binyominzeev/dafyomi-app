<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>YOVEL</i> RESUMED DURING <i>BAYIS RISHON</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Chachamim, who say that the 50th year (Yovel) is not counted towards the next Shemitah and Yovel cycle;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Yehudah, who says that the 50th year is counted, whether or not we count Yovel, every seventh year is Shemitah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, R. Yehudah argues. He holds that they did not count Yovelos in the days of Ezra.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> All must agree that Yovel did apply after Reuven was exiled, for (after this) Yirmeyahu said "mi'Ketz Sheva Shanim Teshalchu Ish Es Achiv ha'Ivri Asher Yimacher Lecha";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "<i>Mi'Ketz</i> Sheva" connotes that an Eved Ivri will go free at the end of seven years, but then it says that he will work six years and go free at the start of the seventh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The Navi said that a slave sold now will go free after six years, and a Nirtza (a slave who chose to keep working after six years) will go free after seven years (i.e. it will be Yovel!).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Navi was rebuking Yisrael because they had not freed slaves when they should have.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "va'Yishme'u va'Yeshalechu"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> This teaches that Yirmeyahu returned the exiled Shevatim (of Malchus Yisrael, therefore, Yovel resumed); Yoshiyah ha'Melech ruled over them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that they returned?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> After Reuven was exiled, Yechezkel said "Ki ha'Mocher El ha'Mimkar Lo Yashuv" - if Yovel did not apply then, there would be no need to say this (that <i>sales</i> will not return)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, we must say that Yirmeyahu returned them (Yovel did apply, Yechezkel prophesied that it would cease).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Yoshiyah ruled over them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 - Question:</span> "Va'Yomer Mah ha'Tziyon ha'Laz... ha'Mizbe'ach Beis Kel" - what was Yoshiyah (Melech Yehudah) doing in Beis Kel (in Malchus Yisrael)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> After Yirmeyahu returned the exiled Shevatim, Yoshiyah ruled over them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It says "Gam Yehudah Shas Katzir Lach b'Shuvi Shevus Ami" ("Reish" and "Nun" are interchangeable, it is as if says "Katzin" - when the exiled Shevatim return, Yehudah will rule over them).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BATEI HA'CHATZERIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who sells a house <i>not</i> in a walled city (we will call this a Beis Chatzer) has the advantages of one who sold a Bayis Ir Chomah and a field:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He can redeem it any time during the first year (for the full price), like Batei Ir Chomah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It returns to him in Yovel, and (if he wants) he can redeem it earlier, according to Gira'on Kesef, like a field (Sedeh Achuzah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "Al Sedeh ha'Aretz Yechashev" equates a Beis Chatzer to a Sedeh Achuzah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a sold field returns in Yovel and can be redeemed earlier according to Gira'on Kesef, the same applies to a Beis Chatzer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like one cannot redeem a sold field before two years, the same should apply to a Beis Chatzer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ge'ulah Tihyeh Lo" allows immediate redemption.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Since one has the best redemption rights of a house and field, it should not return in Yovel!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "uva'Yovel Yetzei."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean? (Since it is equated to a Sedeh Achuzah, surely it returns in Yovel!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> The verse teaches about one (Reuven) who was Makdish a Beis Chatzer, and Shimon redeemed it, and Yovel came in the second year (after the redemption):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we equate it to a Bayis Ir Chomah, it was Chalut after one year, so it cannot be redeemed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If we equate it to a field, it should be given to Kohanim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Uva'Yovel Yetzei" teaches that it returns to Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ze'ira):</span> The same should apply even if no one else redeemed it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> In such a case, it does not return (for free). This is a Gezeirah, lest people think that (also in other cases) Hekdesh becomes Chulin without redemption. (R. Gershom explicitly calls this a Gezeirah. However, the Gemara learns it from a Kal va'Chomer, implying that it is mid'Oraisa! See Ma'aseh Choshev.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this (that redemption is needed)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Levi who was Makdish:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Levi sells, he has great Ko'ach (permanent redemption rights), yet he has little Ko'ach regarding Hekdesh (he never gets it back without redemption);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a Yisrael sells, he has little Ko'ach (he cannot redeem after Yovel). All the more so he has little Ko'ach regarding Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a Levi has little Ko'ach regarding Hekdesh?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer - Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "v'Yotza Mimkar (... ba'Yovel", i.e. a sale returns) even for slaves, Metaltelim and documents!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Bayis v'Ir Achuzaso." (Only houses and cities return/)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "Mimkar"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A sale returns for free, but Hekdesh returns only after Pidyon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Rav Huna (taught above that if Reuven was Makdish a Beis Chatzer, and Shimon redeemed it, it returns to Reuven. He) argues with R. Oshaya;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> "V'Nasan ha'Kesef v'Kam Lo" connotes that one who redeems any Hekdesh keeps it (permanently);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding Sedeh Achuzah it says "v'Hayah ha'Sadeh b'Tzeiso va'Yovel Kodesh la'Shem." It is given to Kohanim in Yovel, but one who redeems a Beis Chatzer keeps it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he learn from "uva'Yovel Yetzei"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> This teaches about one who sold a Beis Chatzer, and Yovel came in the second year (after the sale):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we equate it to a Bayis Ir Chomah, it was Chalut after one year, so it cannot be redeemed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If we equate it to a field, the buyer keeps it until (after Yovel, when) he finishes his two years of crops!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Uva'Yovel Yetzei" teaches that it returns to the seller.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>A Beraisa supports Rav Huna and refutes R. Oshaya;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven was Makdish a Beis Chatzer, he can redeem it immediately, or at any time;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If someone else redeemed it, and Reuven did not buy it back before Yovel, it returns to him in Yovel.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">33b----------------------------------------33b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a city has only two Chatzeros with at least two houses (in each), a house in the city is a Beis Chatzer, even if the city has a wall from the time of Yehoshua.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Question:</span> "Batei ha'Chatzerim" implies that the city has no wall. What do we learn from "Asher Ein Lahem Chomah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (If the city is small,) even if it has a wall, it is as if it does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How many houses can it have (and be considered unwalled)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Batim" connotes two houses, "Chatzeros" connotes two courtyards. It can have two Chatzerim with two houses in each.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that it can have only two Chatzeros with one house in each!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it should have said only "Chatzerim" (and omitted "Batei").</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, perhaps we would have thought that this refers to Chatzeros even without houses!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. A Chatzer without a house is called a Karfef, but not a Chatzer.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>REDEMPTION RIGHTS OF <i>LEVIYIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Rebbi):</span> If a Yisrael inherited (a house) from a Levi, e.g. from his mother's father, he does not (have limited rights to) redeem like this one (like a regular Yisrael, i.e. only within the year. Rather, he can redeem it at any time);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Likewise, if a Levi inherited from a Yisrael, he does not (have rights to) redeem like this one (like a regular Levi). "Ki Batei Arei ha'Leviyim Hi Achuzasam" teaches that permanent redemption rights are only for a Levi (who sold a house) in a Levite city (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, this applies only in Arei ha'Leviyim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> If a Yisrael does not redeem like this, like whom does he redeem?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He redeems like a Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Seifa):</span> He must be a Levi in a Levite city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rebbi means that he redeems only like this (i.e. only within one year), unless he is a Levi in a Levite city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, the house must be in a Levite city - it says "Ki Batei Arei ha'Leviyim... ";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why must he be a Levi?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps a Levi has permanent redemption rights only when he redeems from a Yisrael, for he has greater Ko'ach (for redemption) than the buyer, but not from a Levi, who has equal Ko'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Va'Asher Yig'al Min ha'Leviyim" includes when he redeems from a Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also, "Min ha'Leviyim" excludes some Leviyim, i.e. one who is a Mamzer or Nasin (his mother descends from a Nasin). All the more so, a Yisrael is excluded!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Chachamim hold that permanent redemption applies only in Arei ha'Leviyim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They do not require the seller to be a Levi.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CITY DESIGN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(The Torah commands to surround Arei Leviyim with 1000 Amos of Migrash (empty, unseeded land) and 1000 Amos of field and vineyards.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may not convert a Migrash to be a city (i.e. to build houses) or field, or vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Elazar says, this applies only to Arei Leviyim, but in Arei Yisrael, we may convert a field to be a Migrash or (some texts - but not) a Migrash to be a field;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>We may convert a Migrash to be a city, but not vice-versa, lest Arei Yisrael become desolate.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Kohanim and Leviyim can sell and redeem at any time - "Ge'ulas Olam Tihyeh la'Leviyim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah - R. Elazar):</span> This applies only to Arei Leviyim, but in Arei Yisrael, we may...</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Ge'ulas Olam Tihyeh la'Leviyim." If Leviyim can redeem, obviously they can sell!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer - Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "b'Mispar Shenei Tevu'os Yimkar Lach" (the seller cannot redeem before two years) applies even to a Levi who sold his field!</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Arei Miklat are not small towns, nor great cities, rather, intermediate cities. (Rashi does not explain how we know that intermediate cities are unwalled. Mishnah l'Melech (Hilchos Rotze'ach 8:8) - walled cities attract many people. Aruch l'Ner (Makos 10a, DH Ela) - only very big cities had walls at the time of Yehoshua.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> Leviyim received unwalled cities, and later they built walls around (some of) them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is not considered a walled city!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Ish Ki Yimkor Beis <i>Moshav Ir Chomah</i>" teaches that it was already surrounded by a wall when it was settled, but not if the wall was built later.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps if Bnei Yisrael built a wall (and later settled there, it is considered a walled city)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says here "Chomah," just like it says there (regarding the cities of Og's kingdom). Just like there, they were built by Nochrim, also here.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps if Nochrim built a wall (after Bnei Yisrael conquered Eretz Yisrael, and later it was settled) it is considered a walled city!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef brei d'Rav Sala Chasida):</span> The case is, Leviyim received a walled city (through the lottery to divide up Eretz Yisrael - Rashi; R.

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> One might have thought that until they destroy the wall, it is considered a walled city, and if a house was sold it is Nichlat (after one year). The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
