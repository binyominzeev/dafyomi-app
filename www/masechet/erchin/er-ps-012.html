<p class="dedicationbox">ERCHIN 12 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the twelfth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>NESACHIM</i> BROUGHT BY THEMSELVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Nesachim are brought by themselves (i.e. on a later day than the Korban they are for), do they require Shirah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shmuel bar Nachmani taught that Shirah is said only over wine. Therefore, we should sing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps we sing only for "eating" (Haktarah) and "drinking" (Nesachim) together!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> Hash-m causes good things to happen on meritorious days...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> For which Korban was the Shirah?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot be for Olas Chovah. they ceased to offer the Tamid three weeks earlier!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, it was for Olas Nedavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Mari brei d'Rav Kahana taught that we do not sing for Olas Nedavah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, it was for Nesachim (of a Korban brought at least three weeks ago)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> We cannot say that it was for Nesachim. The Shir for (anything offered on) Yom Rishon is "la'Shem ha'Aretz u'Melo'ah," but they said "va'Yashev Aleihem... ," from the Shir for Yom Revi'i!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that they were standing on the Duchan (i.e. they were supposed to sing)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like Reish Lakish, who says that they may sing without a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, they may sing for Nesachim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, for this can lead to disaster.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE CHURBANOS WERE IN MOTZA'EI SHEMITAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> Hash-m causes good things to happen on meritorious days... The first Mikdash was destroyed... in the year after Shemitah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It was not Motza'ei Shemitah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "B'Esrim v'Chamesh Shanah l'Galuseinu b'Rosh Hashanah be'Asor la'Chodesh b'Arba Esreh Shanah Achar Asher Huksah ha'Ir" - when is Rosh Hashanah on the 10th of the month?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refers to Yovel. (Yom Kipur is like the beginning of the Yovel year. It is when land reverts to sellers and Ivri slaves go free. This the 25th year from <i>Galuseinu</i> (when Yechezkel was exiled with 1000 Chachamim, 11 years before the Churban), 14 years after the Churban.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question (b):</span> (Yovel is always in Motza'ei Shemitah.) If the Churban was in Motza'ei Shemitah, also the eighth and 15th years from the Churban were Motza'ei Shemitah. We proved from the verse that the 14th year was Yovel!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> It was in the 14th year <i>after</i> (excluding the year of) the Churban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it was 15 years from (including the year of) the Churban, it was 26 years from Galuseinu (the first exile. The verse says that it was the 25th year!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yisraelim were exiled in the seventh, eighth, 18th year and 19th years. The Churban was in the 18th year, 11 years after Galuseinu!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Ravina):</span> (Surely the final Galus, in year 19, was at the time of the Churban.) If you say that the verse means 14 years from (<i>including</i>) the Churban, this is 26 years after Galuseinu, which was 12 years before the Churban!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> You must say that the verse refers to the 25th year <i>after</i> (excluding the year of) Galuseinu. I similarly say that the count excludes the year of the Churban!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Ravina explain? (If the Churban was 12 years after Galuseinu, Yovel was the 27th year from Galuseinu, but the verse says 25!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You assume that the exiles of years 18 and 19 are different. Really, they are one. It was 18 years from the conquest of Yehoyakim, and 19 years from the start of Nebuchadnetzar's reign. (Similarly, Galuseinu was seven and eight years after these two times.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Nebuchadnetzar conquered Ninveh in the first year of his reign. He conquered Yehoyakim in his second year.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">12b----------------------------------------12b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The same applies to the second Churban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The second Churban was not in Motza'ei Shemitah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Bayis Sheni stood 420 years before the Churban (which was in year 421). Eight Yovel cycles span 400 years (each is 50 years), leaving 20 years, i.e. two complete Shemitah cycles and six years (so the Churban was not in Motza'ei Shemitah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Beraisa is R. Yehudah, who says that year 50 (Yovel) also counts as the first year of the next Yovel cycle (so each cycle is 49 years);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we make the above calculation according to R. Yehudah, we are left with eight more years (since each Yovel cycle has one year less). Bayis Sheni stood 28 years (four complete Shemitos) into the ninth Yovel. The Churban was the next year, i.e. Motza'ei Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It cannot be R. Yehudah. According to him, the first Churban was not in Motza'ei Shemitah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Bnei Yisrael counted 17 Yovel cycles from entering Eretz Yisrael until the first Churban. (Bayis Rishon was built 440 years after entering, and it stood 410 years.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We cannot say that they began counting Yovel immediately upon entering, for then the Churban would have been in the first year of Yovel (after 850 years, 17 full cycles). Rather, it was 14 years before this - "b'Rosh Hashanah be'Asor la'Chodesh b'Arba Esreh Shanah Achar Asher Huksah ha'Ir"!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, we must say that they did not start counting for 14 years, i.e. after seven years of conquest and seven of dividing Eretz Yisrael among the Shevatim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This is unlike R. Yehudah. He holds that a Yovel cycle has 49 years. Seventeen extra years would remain, and the Churban would have been three years after Yovel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We did not count Yovel from the time that Sancheriv exiled the 10 tribes (for then Yovel did not apply), until Yirmeyahu returned them. (A new cycle began then, 36 years before the Churban.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (i)):</span> Really, the Beraisa is Chachamim. "The same applies to the second Churban" refers to other matters. (It was on Tish'ah b'Av on Motza'ei Shabbos, but it was not in Motza'ei Shemitah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Surely, not everything mentioned applied also to the second Churban. The Mishmar Yehoyariv was not in Bayis Sheni!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Four (of the 24) Mishmaros returned from Bavel -- Yedayah, Charim, Pashchor and Eimar. Nevi'im divided them into 24. Each of the four Mishmaros would also serve in place of five missing Mishmaros. A lottery was used to decide in which order they would serve.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Nevi'im enacted that even if Yehoyariv (formerly the first Mishmar) would later return, they would be secondary to Yedayah. (Rashi - Yehoyariv never returned. Tosfos - even if it returned, it was not called by its name, so we would not say that Churban Sheni was during its week.)</p>
