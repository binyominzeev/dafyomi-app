<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>SCHEMING AGAINST HEKDESH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If Reuven was Makdish property Meshu'abad to pay his wife's Kesuvah, when he divorces her, he must vow not to benefit from (relations with) her. (Perhaps he schemes to remarry her after she collects from Hekdesh);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehoshua says, he need not vow.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, similarly, if a divorcee seeks to collect her Kesuvah from an Arev (guarantor), her ex-husband must vow not to benefit from her, lest he plans to remarry her after she takes the Arev's money.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #1:</span> R. Eliezer holds that one is suspected of scheming to swindle Hekdesh. R. Yehoshua holds that he is not suspected.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Huna taught that if a Shechiv me'Ra (dying person) was Makdish all his property, and said "one Maneh in my possession really belongs to Ploni," he is believed. There is a Chazakah that people do not scheme to cheat Hekdesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Do Tana'im argue about Rav Huna's law?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. They argue only about a healthy person, but all agree that a dying person does not scheme to swindle Hekdesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He will not live to benefit from the money. Ein Adam Chotei v'Lo Lo. (One will not sin just to benefit others, in this case his heirs.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> All agree that a healthy person is suspected of scheming to swindle Hekdesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2A:</span> They argue about a Neder b'Rabim (made in front of many people):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehoshua holds that it can be permitted, therefore it is useless to force the husband to vow. (He will permit his vow later);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer holds that it cannot be permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2B:</span> Alternatively, they argue about a Neder Al Da'as Rabim (dependent on the will of at least two others. R. Yehoshua holds that it can be permitted, R. Eliezer holds that it cannot. The following two objections attack Answers 2A and 2B.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> Ameimar taught that a Neder b'Rabim can be permitted, but a Neder Al Da'as Rabim cannot be permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Do Tana'im argue about Ameimar's teaching?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> Why does R. Yehoshua say that he <i>need not</i> vow? He should say it <i>would not help</i> to vow!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, they argue about whether one can permit Hekdesh (through regret, like Hataras Nedarim. It is like mistaken Hekdesh).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If Reuven was Makdish property Meshu'abad to pay his wife's Kesuvah, when he divorces her, he must vow not to benefit from her;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>R. Yehoshua says, he need not vow.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon:</span> These opinions are according to Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Shamai holds that mistaken Hekdesh takes effect. (Therefore, one cannot permit Hekdesh; we are concerned for scheming);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel holds that mistaken Hekdesh does not take effect. (One can permit Hekdesh through regret. One would not scheme to swindle Hekdesh by divorcing his wife!)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>COLLECTING FROM AN AREV FOR A KESUVAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rav Huna bar Moshe was a Chacham in dire financial straits. His father was an Arev for the Kesuvah of Huna's wife.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Why doesn't someone suggest to Rav Huna that he divorce his wife, and remarry her after she collects the Kesuvah from his father?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> The Mishnah says he must vow that he will not benefit from her!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> He can divorce her outside of Beis Din. Perhaps the father will pay without making him vow!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It became known that Rav Huna was a Kohen (who cannot marry a divorcee), so the scheme was not feasible.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Poverty clings to the poor! (They do not easily escape it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could Abaye have suggested such a scheme?! (In a Beraisa, R. Shimon ben Gamliel says that if Reuven gave a gift to Shimon, and stipulated that it will pass to Levi after him, if Shimon sells it, Levi never gets it, even after Shimon dies.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> A crafty Rasha is one who counsels (Shimon) to sell, according to R. Shimon ben Gamliel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here is different, for the father's money would go to his son (who would eventually inherit him anyway). Also, Huna was a Chacham (it is a Mitzvah to support Chachamim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Halachah is that an Arev for a Kesuvah is not obligated! (This will be explained later.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">23b----------------------------------------23b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The father was a Kablan (an Arev with greater responsibility).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand according to the opinion that a Kablan for a Kesuvah is obligated;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, according to the opinion that a Kablan for a Kesuvah is not obligated unless the husband had property (at the time he agreed to be a Kablan), how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, Rav Huna had property (when his father became a Kablan). Later, it was flooded.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> A father obligates himself for his son (even if the son has no property).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>All agree that an Arev for a Kesuvah is not obligated;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>All agree that a Kablan for a loan is obligated;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>The argument is about a Kablan for a Kesuvah and an Arev for a loan. One opinion says that the Kablan (or Arev) is obligated only if the husband (or borrower) has property;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>The other opinion says that either way, he is obligated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>The Halachah is, an Arev is obligated whether or not the borrower has property, except for an Arev for a Kesuvah, who is never obligated;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he not obligated for a Kesuvah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He gets no benefit. He thinks "I am doing a Mitzvah (to help them get married). She is not losing anything." (She prefers to be married, even if there is no Arev for her Kesuvah. He does not really intend to pay.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN ARE WE CONCERNED FOR SCHEMING?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A certain man sold property, and later divorced his wife.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef brei d'Rava):</span> The Mishnah requires a vow before collecting from Hekdesh or an Arev. What is the law concerning buyers?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> The Tana is not a peddler (who must mention everything he has. Surely, a vow is required.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Chachamim of Neharda'a):</span> A vow is required only in the cases mentioned in the Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mesharshiya):</span> What is Neharda'a's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mesharshiya):</span> One must vow before collecting from Hekdesh. This is so Hekdesh will not lose;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Also we do not want an Arev for a Kesuvah to lose. He did a Mitzvah (to help the couple get married, and even if the wife will not collect,) she did not lose (just she did not receive);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A buyer knows that every wife has a Kesuvah. He bought the land knowing that it was Meshu'abad. He caused his own loss!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>HEKDESH OF MESHU'ABAD PROPERTY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven owed a Kesuvah or debt to Simchah (his ex-wife or creditor), and was Makdish his property, Simchah may not take the property from Hekdesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Tosfos):</span> (If the property is worth more than the debt,) anyone who wants to can redeem the property (for its value, less the debt owed) and pays the debt from it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the property is worth (less, e.g.) 90 and the debt is 100, Simchah "lends" another Dinar, he redeems the property for a Dinar and keeps the property.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi):</span> Rather, the redeemer (Reuven) redeems the property in order to pay his debt, e.g. if the property is worth 90 and the debt is 100, he borrows another Dinar and redeems the property for a Dinar to pay the debt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Version #1 - Tosfos - Question:</span> Why does it say "anyone who wants to can redeem"? (The part that was owed was never really Hekdesh!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rashi - Question:</span> Why does it say "the redeemer redeems" (for a Dinar)? (The property never became Hekdesh!) (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We want it to look like he redeems (Tosfos - all of) the property, for R. Avahu's reason:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> This is so people will not say that Hekdesh becomes Chulin without redemption.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Our Mishnah is unlike R. Shimon ben Gamliel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> If the debt is at least as much as the property is worth, he redeems it (for a Dinar);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Tosfos):</span> If the debt is less than the property is worth, he need not redeem it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi):</span> If the debt is less than the property is worth, he may not redeem it (for less than its true value. Since Simchah did not rely on this land to collect the entire amount, it is not Meshu'abad at all.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Chachamim (our Tana), how much must the property be worth (for the law of a one-Dinar redemption to apply)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna bar Yehudah):</span> It must be at least half the debt.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>SIDUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven owes Erchin, even though we take a security from him, we leave him with the following (or money to buy them if he does not have them):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Food for 30 days, clothes for a year, a bed and sheet, shoes, and Tefilin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We leave for him, but not for his wife and children.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he is a craftsman, we leave him two of everything needed for his trade;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We leave a carpenter with two planing tools and two saws.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Eliezer says, we leave a farmer with a yoked pair of oxen. We leave a donkey-driver with his donkey;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If he had extra (more than two) of one kind of tool and less than two of another kind, he may not sell the extras to buy the kind he is lacking. Rather, he keeps two of the former and whatever he has of the latter.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If one was Makdish his property, we evaluate his Tefilin, and he redeems them.</p></div>
