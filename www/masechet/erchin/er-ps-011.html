<p class="dedicationbox">ERCHIN 11 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the twelfth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Shila):</span> There was a Magreifah (Rashi - shovel; Tosfos - instrument) in the Mikdash. It had 10 holes. Through each could come 10 kinds of song, making 100 in all.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It was an Amah long and an Amah tall. It had 10 holes on its handle. Through each could come 100 kinds of song, making 1000 in all.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The way to remember the opinions is that Tana'ic (Agadic) teachings are sometimes exaggerated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> The flute players were slaves of Kohanim...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Meir says that they were slaves of Kohanim, because he holds that the main Mitzvah (incumbent on Leviyim) of Shirah is vocal. The instruments merely accompany the voices. R. Chanina says that they were Leviyim, because he holds that Shirah is primarily instrumental.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This does not explain R. Yosi! (He says that they were from families of good lineage.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Shirah is (primarily) vocal, even slaves should suffice. If it is instrumental, Leviyim should be required!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Rather, all agree that Shirah is vocal. They argue about whether or not we are Ma'alim (establish someone to be a Levi of proper lineage) because he played on the Duchan (the platform on which Leviyim sing):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir says that they were slaves of Kohanim. He holds that we are not Ma'alim from the Duchan, not regarding lineage (to marry one who played on the Duchan without checking for forbidden lineages such as Mamzerus), nor (to give him) Ma'aser;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Chanina says that they were Leviyim  (of good lineage). He holds that we are Ma'alim for lineage and Ma'aser;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yosi says that they had good lineage. He holds that (Rosh - we decree to require good lineage, lest people assume that) we are Ma'alim from the Duchan regarding lineage, but not for Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN SHIRAH IS SUNG</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Shir is Me'akev the Korban (Tosfos - i.e. the Nesachim; Rosh - when the Nesachim are brought with the Korban, Shir is Me'akev the Korban).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Meir's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ha'Leviyim... u'Lechaper Al Bnei Yisrael" teaches that just like Kaparah is Me'akev (if the Korban was not Mechaper, another must be brought), also (Avodas ha'Leviyim, i.e.) Shirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Chachamim use this to teach R. Elazar's law;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Just like Kaparah must be during the day, also Shirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yehudah):</span> What is the source that Shirah is required?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> "V'Sheres b'Shem Hash-m Elokav" - Shirah is Sherus (Avodah) with Hash-m's name.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it refers to Birkas Kohanim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Lesharso <i>u</i>l'Varech bi'Shemo" teaches that Sherus is not Birkas Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Masnah):</span> "Tachas Asher Lo Avadeta Es Hash-m Elokecha b'Simchah uv'Tuv Levav" teaches that Shirah is Avodah done amidst joy.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is learning Torah, for it says "Pekudei Hash-m Yesharim Mesamchei Lev"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Torah is called "Mesamchei Lev," but it is not called "Tov" (in association with the heart, or with Simchah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is Bikurim, about which it says "v'Samachta b'Chol ha'Tov"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Tov," but it does not say "Tov Levav."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Masnah):</span> What is the source that Shirah must accompany Bikurim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Masnah):</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Tov-Tov."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shmuel bar Nachmani taught that Shirah is said only over wine, for it says "va'Tomer Lahem ha'Gefen... Tiroshi ha'Mesame'ach Elokim va'Anashim."</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We know that wine gladdens man. How does it gladden Hash-m?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shirah (of the Leviyim gladdens Hash-m, and it) is said only over wine (Nesachim).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Wine may be brought for Bikurim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> We bring fruit for Bikurim, but not juice;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that if one brought grapes and pressed them, the juice may be brought (Tosfos - l'Chatchilah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Tavi" (is extra to include this).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Chizkiyah):</span> "U'Chenanyahu Sar ha'Leviyim b'Masa Yasor" - we read this "Yashir."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Bilvati):</span> "La'avod Avodas Avodah" - Shirah is the Avodah that requires another Avodah. (Rashi - it is done only with Nesachim; R. Gershom - Leviyim sing, and others play instruments to accompany them.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5 (R. Yitzchak):</span> "Se'u Zimrah u'Senu Sof Kinor Na'im Im Navel."</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since it says that they serve with their shoulders, it need not say "Yisa'u" (they will carry)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yisa'u" denotes Shirah - "Se'u Zimrah u'Senu Sof... "</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #8 (Chananyah, nephew of R. Yehoshua):</span> "Moshe Yedaber veha'Elokim Ya'anenu v'Kol" refers to matters of his voice. (Hash-m told Moshe to sing Shirah, for he was a Levi.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #9 (Rav Ashi):</span> It says "va'Yehi ch'Echad la'Mechatzrim vela'Meshorerim l'Hashmi'a Kol Echad."</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #10 (R. Yonason):</span> It says "v'Lo Yamusu Gam Hem Gam Atem." (If a Kohen or Levi performed the other's Avodah, he is Chayav Misah b'Yedei Shamayim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like you (Kohanim) engage in Avodas Mizbe'ach, also Leviyim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> "V'Lo Yamusu Gam Hem Gam Atem" - if you do their Avodah, or vice-versa, the punishment is Misah. (Some families of Leviyim lock the gates, and the others sing);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a Levi did the wrong Avodas Levi, he transgresses a Lav, but he is not Chayav Misah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The Halachah is, if a singer locked gates (Rambam - or vice-versa), he is Chayav Misah - "veha'Chonim Lifnei ha'Mishkan Kedmah... veha'Zar ha'Karev Yumas";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To what kind of Zar does it refer?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It cannot mean a Yisrael. Another verse teaches that!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it refers to someone else who is foreign to Avodas Leviyim (i.e. a Kohen).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a singer locked gates, or a gatekeeper sang, he transgresses a Lav, but he is not Chayav Misah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about this;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A case occurred in which R. Yehoshua bar Chananyah went to help lock gates.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Gudgoda:</span> Refrain! You are a singer, and not a gatekeeper!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yochanan ben Gudgoda holds that a singer who locks gates (<i>by himself</i>) is Chayav Misah, therefore Chachamim decreed that he may not help. R. Yehoshua holds that this is only a Lav, therefore there is no decree against helping.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. All agree that it is only a Lav. They argue about whether or not there was a decree not to help.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Avin):</span> Does a voluntary Olas Tzibur require Shirah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Torah requires Shirah with "Oloseichem," whether Chovah (obligatory) or Nedavah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps it refers to Olos of all Yisrael (but not Olos Nedavah, which come from money of individuals)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "Va'Yomer Chizkiyahu... uv'Es Hechel ha'Olah Hechel Shir Hash-m veha'Chatzotzeros."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> For which Korban was the Shirah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It was for Olas Chovah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They would not have needed to ask Chizkiyah about this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was for Olas Nedavah. (This completes Answer #1. The coming defenses of the suggestion (2) are also rejections of Answer #1.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Defense #1 (of suggestion - Rav Yosef):</span> It was for an Olas Chovah, i.e. of Rosh Chodesh. They needed to ask whether the day was indeed Mekudash to be Rosh Chodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> It says "uv'Yom Shishah Asar la'Chodesh"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Defense #2 (Rami brei d'Rav Yeva):</span> It was for the Olah that accompanies the Omer. They were unsure whether or not this is the 16th of the month, for they were unsure which day was Mekudash to be Rosh Chodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Avya):</span> Surely, they already knew this. This is after they brought Korban Pesach and ate Matzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Defense #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> It was for Olas Chovah. Even though they knew that it requires Shirah, it is proper to ask, just like a Shali'ach Tzibur asks permission (to lead the congregation in prayer).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> Hash-m causes good things to happen on meritorious days, and bad things to happen on unworthy days;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Beis ha'Mikdash was destroyed on Tish'ah b'Av. It was the day after Shabbos, it was the year after Shemitah, it was the Mishmar (division of Kohanim) of Yehoyariv; Kohanim and Leviyim were standing on the Duchan and singing Shirah, "va'Yashev Aleihem Es Avonam uv'Ra'asam Yatzmisem";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Before they said the next verse "Yatzmisem Hash-m Elokeinu," the enemy conquered them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The same applied at the second Churban.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> For which Korban was the Shirah?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It cannot be for Olas Chovah. They ceased to offer the Tamid three weeks earlier!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it was for Olas Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Tamid ceased because they ran out of animals. If they had animals for Nedavah, they would have offered them for the Tamid instead!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Olas Nedavah was a bull. The Tamid must be a lamb.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> We cannot say that the Shirah was for the Korban. (Tosfos - if so, it would require the Shir for that day.) The Shir for Yom Rishon is "la'Shem ha'Aretz u'Melo'ah," but they said "va'Yashev Aleihem Es Avonam... ," from the Shir for Yom Revi'i!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, Hash-m caused them to sing this (for it was appropriate for the Churban. We need not say that Korbanos Nedavah require Shirah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that they were standing on the Duchan! (I.e. they needed to sing for an obligatory Korban.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like Reish Lakish, who says that they may sing without a Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, they may sing for Olas Nedavah! (It is no worse than no Korban.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, this can lead to disaster! (Rashi - people may think that just like Shirah for Nedavah is optional, also for Olas Chovah of the Tzibur. R. Gershom - people may think that one may not offer Nedavos without Shirah, and will improperly refrain from offering.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the conclusion?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Mari brei d'Rav Kahana expounded "(we play trumpets) Al Oloseichem v'Al Zivchei Shalmeichem" - just like Olah is Kodshei Kodashim, also the Shelamim in this verse (i.e. it is Shalmei Tzibur);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like the Shelamim has a fixed time (Shavu'os), also the Olah.</p></div>
