<p class="dedicationbox">ERCHIN 14 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the twelfth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>REDEMPTION OF A SEDEH ACHUZAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are leniencies and stringencies of Sedeh Achuzah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Whether one was Makdish Cholas ha'Mechuz (land outside the city - it produces little, for people trample on it, or because of Ayin ha'Ra; Shitah Mekubetzes - sandy land), or the nicest orchard, he redeems it for 50 Shekalim per Beis Kor (an area in which a Kor of barley is sown, 2500 square Amos).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he was Makdish a Sedeh Miknah (a purchased field), he redeems it for its value.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Eliezer says, the fixed redemption applies also to a Sedeh Miknah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (According to R. Eliezer,) what is the difference between a Sedeh Achuzah and a Sedeh Miknah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One who redeems his Sedeh Achuzah adds a Chomesh (a quarter of the principal). One who redeems his Sedeh Miknah does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Huna):</span> If one was Makdish a field full of trees, he redeems the trees for their value, and also pays 50 Shekalim (per Beis Kor) for the field.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Rav Huna holds that one is Makdish b'Ayin Yafeh (generously).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman - Mishnah):</span> Whether one was Makdish land just outside the city, or the nicest orchard, he redeems it for 50 Shekalim. (He does not pay extra for the trees!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> The Mishnah discusses Hekdesh of land proper for an orchard (but there are no trees there now).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "Beis Zera" teaches about a field in which one plants seeds;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to include a vineyard, a field of reeds or a tree field?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Sadeh" is any field.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> Indeed, the verse teaches that he pays 50 Shekalim <i>for the land</i>, but he must also redeem the trees for their value.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they are spread out more or less densely, or if he did not Makdish all three at once, he did not Makdish the land and trees between them (he redeems the Hekdesh trees for their value);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Even if he later was Makdish the land, he redeems the trees according to their value, and the land for 50 Shekalim. (In the Reisha, he pays 50 Shekalim in all. This refutes Rav Huna!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Also in the Reisha, he pays 50 Shekalim, and he must redeem also the trees for their value.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Since the Seifa says that he must do so, this implies that in the Reisha he need not!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is R. Shimon, who says that one is Makdish b'Ayin Ra'ah (stingily):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one makes a field Hekdesh, everything inside becomes Hekdesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says only grafted carob and sycamore stumps become Hekdesh. (They nurture greatly from the ground, which is Hekdesh.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa is not like R. Shimon!</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We know that R. Shimon follows the time of redemption. Since both are Hekdesh then, the trees should be redeemed Agav (along with) the field!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah and R. Shimon):</span> If one bought a field from his father, and was Makdish it; and his father died, it is now considered a Sedeh Achuzah. (Its redemption is fixed, i.e. 50 Shekalim per Beis Kor);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"Asher Lo mi'Sedeh Achuzaso" teaches that a Sedeh Miknah (a purchased field, which is redeemed for its value) is only a field that he could not have inherited. (He would have inherited this field had he not bought it!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Meir says, if one bought a field from his father and was Makdish it after his father died, it is considered a Sedeh Achuzah;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"Asher Lo mi'Sedeh Achuzaso" refers to a field that was not inherited when he was Makdish it (but he inherited permanent rights to this field. His purchase was only until Yovel). (end of Beraisa)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question (6) - Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> No, they expound something else in the verse;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It could have said "Sedeh Miknaso Asher Lo Achuzaso." Rather, it says "<i>mi</i>'Sedeh" (an exclusion), i.e. only a field that could not become his inheritance.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding fixed redemption it says "Beis Zera." Tarshin is not fitting to be sown.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding this law it says "Sadeh", i.e. any field.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse that requires waiting two years says "Mispar Shnei Tevu'os." Tarshin yields no produce.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding this law it says "v'Shav la'Achuzaso." Also this is an inheritance.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "v'Shav la'Achuzaso." Trees are not an inheritance.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If one was Makdish trees, he redeems them for their value.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The land (underneath them) should become Hekdesh Agav (with) them. They should be redeemed Agav the land!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he was Makdish the trees, but not the land.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Chachamim of Neharda'a taught that one who sells a date tree includes the land from the bottom of the tree down to the depths!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed he was Makdish only the trees. The land is included only when the buyer claims that the seller explicitly stipulated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he was Makdish a Sedeh Miknah, he redeems it for its value.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What do we learn from "Michsas" (the calculation of the redemption of a Sedeh Miknah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (A Sedeh Achuzah the size of) "Zera Chomer Se'orim" is redeemed for 50 Shekalim. One might have thought that the same applies to Sedeh Miknah. "Michsas" teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>R. Eliezer says, it says "v'Chishav" regarding Sedeh Miknah and regarding Sedeh Achuzah. Just like the latter has a fixed redemption, also the former.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do Chachamim agree that there is a Gezeirah Shavah, just they use it to teach about Chomesh? (I.e. one must add a Chomesh when redeeming Sedeh Miknah, just like for Sedeh Achuzah.) Or, do they say that there is no Gezeirah Shavah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Presumably, they say that there is no Gezeirah Shavah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Twice, the Torah teaches to add a Chomesh, regarding Sedeh Miknah and one who is Makdish his house. These are Shnei Kesuvim (two verses, one of which teaches something which could have been learned from the other), so they do not teach about other laws. (Tosfos - they do not teach even through Gezeirah Shavah. According to the opinion (that Tosfos cites) that Shnei Kesuvim can teach through Gezeirah Shavah, Rava could mean that it is unreasonable to say that there is a Gezeirah Shavah, for if so (Chomesh applies to every Hekdesh, and) there was no need to write Chomesh in two places. It could have written it once, and we would have learned to all Hekdesh!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Since the Torah teaches Chomesh also regarding Ma'aser Sheni and Hekdesh of Tahor and Tamei animals, the same reasoning applies to the opinion that we learn from Shnei Kesuvim. He agrees that we do not learn from three (or more) Kesuvim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>A Beraisa supports Rava's law (that Chomesh does not apply to Sedeh Miknah), but for a different reason;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Michsas ha'Erkecha" equates redemption of Sedeh Miknah to Erchin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Just like we do not add Chomesh to Erchin, we do not add to redemption of a Sedeh Miknah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>OTHER LENIENCIES AND STRINGENCIES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are leniencies and stringencies of Shor ha'Mu'ad:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Whether it killed the nicest (most valuable) slave or the worst, the owner pays 30 Shekalim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it killed a Yisrael, the owner pays the victim's value.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If it damaged a slave or Yisrael, the owner pays full damage.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> All these laws apply only to a Mu'ad, but not to a Tam (an animal not established to gore).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is unlike R. Akiva, who says that if a Tam damaged a Yisrael, its owner pays full damage in excess of what the Yisrael damaged the animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Our Mishnah is even like R. Akiva. The Seifa applies even to a Tam;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since the other clauses apply only to a Mu'ad, the Tana (did not specify otherwise in the Seifa, i.e. he) taught the Seifa only about a Mu'ad.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE PAYMENT FOR BOSHES AND PEGAM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are leniencies and stringencies of Ones and Mefateh (rape or enticement of a virgin):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Whether he raped (or enticed) the most dignified Bas Kohen, or the lowliest Bas Yisrael, he pays 50 Shekalim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The (compensation for) Boshes (embarrassment) and Pegam (loss of virginity) is according to the girl and the rapist. (Boshes is greatest if she is prestigious and he is lowly (Rashi Kesuvos 40a - if he is average). Pegam is greater for a more prestigious (Tosfos Kesuvos 40b; Rambam - prettier) girl.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The Torah says only that he pays 50. What is the source to pay Boshes and Pegam?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Ze'ira):</span> (The Torah would not say that he pays only 50, for then) people would (justifiably) protest, does one pay the same for the king's daughter like for a commoners' daughter?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> (If a Shor ha'Mu'ad kills any slave, the bull's owner pays 30.) We are not concerned lest people protest 'does one pay 30 for a slave skilled to pierce pearls (to thread them on a string, which is very lucrative) like for one who only sews?!</p></div>
