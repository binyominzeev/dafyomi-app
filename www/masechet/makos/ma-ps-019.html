<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava bar Ada):</span> From when are Bikurim have a punishment of Misah b'Yedei Shamayim for a Zar who eats them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is after they enter the Azarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This is like R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If Bikurim are partially in the Azarah, the part inside is like Hekdesh in all respects, and the part outside is like Chulin in all respects.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> Hanachah is Me'akev Bikurim, but Kri'ah is not Me'akev.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This is like R. Yishmael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi citing R. Yishmael) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps even nowadays (after the Churban) one may bring Ma'aser Sheni to Yerushalayim and eat it!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should learn from Bechor, which also must be brought to Yerushalayim. It may be eaten only when the Mikdash stands!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not learn from Bechor, for its blood and Eimurim must be thrown on the Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should learn from Bikurim (which may not be eaten today)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not learn from Bikurim, for they require Hanachah (in front of the Mizbe'ach).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Ochalta... Ma'aser Degancha... u'Vchoros Bekarcha" equates Ma'aser to Bechor;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like Bechor may be eaten only when the Mikdash stands, also Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yishmael said that we do not learn from Bikurim, for they require Hanachah. He did not say that they require Hanachah <i>and Kri'ah</i>. (This shows that he holds that Kri'ah is not Me'akev.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> Even if Kri'ah is not Me'akev, there is a Mitzvah to do Kri'ah. He should have said that we cannot learn from Bikurim because the Mitzvos of Hanachah and Kri'ah apply to them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> He did not ask from Kri'ah because it does not always apply. E.g., a convert does not do Kri'ah, for he cannot say "Asher Nishba Hash-m la'Avoseinu." (There is no proof whether or not R. Yishmael holds that Kri'ah is Me'akev.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need a Hekesh to learn from Bechor? We should be able to learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah of Bechor and Bikurim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn from them, for both require the Mizbe'ach (for Zerikas Dam and Eimurim of Bechor, and Hanachah of Bikurim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yishmael's opinion about Kedushah (of the Mikdash)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the original Kedushah was permanent, we should be able to bring Bechor today!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it was not permanent, he should also ask about Bechor! (If Zerikah was done for a Bechor before the Churban, may one eat the meat in Yerushalayim (within the allotted two days, even if this is) after the Churban? Tosfos' text - If it was not permanent, also Ma'aser should be forbidden!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> He holds that the original Kedushah was not permanent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Churban came after Zerikas Dam of a Bechor and meat remained, it is obvious to him that it is forbidden because he equates the meat to the blood;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like the Mizbe'ach is needed for Zerikah, it is needed to eat the meat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yishmael learned Ma'aser from a Hekesh to Bechor. Bechor itself was learned from a Hekesh, so it cannot teach through a Hekesh! (Regarding Kodshim, we do not learn a Hekesh from something learned from a Hekesh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ma'aser (of Peros) is not Kodshim. It is Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that it (learning a Hekesh from a Hekesh) depends on whether or not the matter being learned is Kodesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, according to like the opinion that it depends on what we learn from, Bechor is Kodesh, we cannot learn to Ma'aser!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Blood and meat are the same. (It is as if the Isur to eat the meat was learned directly, and not from a Hekesh.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>EATING MA'ASER SHENI B'TUM'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kodshei Kodoshim... (and Ma'aser Sheni outside the wall).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The first Mishnah of our Perek already taught Ma'aser Sheni and Hekdesh that were not redeemed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Our Mishnah discusses a Tahor (person) eating Tahor Ma'aser Sheni outside Yerushalayim. The first Mishnah discusses eating in Yerushalayim when the person or Ma'aser Sheni is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that one is lashed for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> (It says in the Viduy of Ma'aser) "v'Lo Vi'arti Mimenu b'Tamei" - I did not eat when I or the Ma'aser was Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I do not know where the Torah warns against this...</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> The Torah explicitly warns a Tamei person - "... v'Tam'ah Ad ha'Erev v'Lo Yochal Min ha'Kodoshim"!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Clarification:</span> R. Shimon asks where the Torah warns against eating Tamei Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Continuation:</span> It says (about a blemished Bechor) "bi'She'arecha Tochalenu ha'Tamei veha'Tahor Yachdav";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> A Tamei and Tahor may eat from the same bowl. We are not concerned lest the food is Tamei. .	It says "Lo Suchal Le'chol bi'She'arecha (Ma'aser... )", i.e. one may not eat Ma'aser the way one may eat something else (a blemished Bechor) that is eaten "bi'She'arecha", i.e. when the food is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN MAY <i>MA'ASER</i> <i>SHENI</i> BE REDEEMED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that one may redeem Tamei Ma'aser?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> One may redeem Tamei Ma'aser even in Yerushalayim (because it may not be eaten) - "Lo Suchal Se'eso";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Seis' refers to eating - "va'Yisa <i>Mas'os</i> me'Es Panav" (Yosef gave to his brothers to eat.).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Bivi):</span> Tahor Ma'aser may be redeemed even one step outside the wall (because it may not be eaten there) - "Lo Suchal Se'eso."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need the verse for R. Elazar's law!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the Torah wanted to teach only his law, it should have said 'Lo Suchal Le'achlo';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Se'eso" (which connotes carrying) alludes to Rav Bivi's law (permission to eat depends on carrying it into Yerushalayim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the verse teaches only Rav Bivi's law!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it should have said 'Lo Suchal Litlo';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it says "Se'eso", which also connotes eating, to teach both.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina and R. Hoshaya):</span> What is the law if he is (carrying Ma'aser) at the entrance to Yerushalayim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Clearly, if he is outside and the Ma'aser is inside, it is considered inside (and he may not redeem it if it is Tahor);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he is inside and the Ma'aser is outside, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (An elder from R. Shimon's academy):</span> "Ki Yirchak <i>Mimcha</i> ha'Makom" - from your entirety, i.e. you may redeem (Tahor) Ma'aser only if you and your load are outside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If he is (inside,) holding it on a stick (and the Ma'aser is outside), what is the law? (Since it does not rest on his body, perhaps he may redeem it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> One is liable for eating Ma'aser Sheni outside Yerushalayim only if it was once inside.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "Lifnei Hash-m Elokecha Tochalenu..." and "Lo Suchal Le'chol bi'She'arecha." The Lav applies only if it was once possible to eat it "Lifnei Hash-m" (inside Yerushalayim).</p>
