<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Seritah with an instrument is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Seritah and Gedidah are the same, just Seritah is by hand, and Gedidah is with an instrument.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel's law is according to R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">A reciter of Beraisos:</span> One is liable due to a Mes whether he scratched by hand or with an instrument;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who scratches for the sake of idolatry is liable only by hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The verse says just the contrary - "va'Yisgodedu k'Mishpatam ba'Charavos uva'Rmachim"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> One who scratches for the sake of idolatry is liable only with an instrument.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PE'AS HA'ROSH AND PE'AS HA'ZAKAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He is lashed for each Pe'as ha'Rosh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rav Sheshes pointed to the sideburns</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He is lashed for each Pe'as ha'Zakan, i.e. two on each side and one below.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav Sheshes pointed to the five corners.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If he cut them at once (at the same moment; alternatively, with one warning, without stopping), he is liable only once.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>He holds that one Lav forbids all the corners.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He is liable only if he shaved (the beard; some say, or the sideburns) with a razor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "u'Fe'as Zekanam Lo Yegalechu" obligates for shaving with scissors!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Lo Sashchis" - he is liable only if the entire hair is removed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one is liable for removing the hair with a planing tool (or tweezers)!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> He is liable even if he cut them with a planing tool (or tweezers).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> No matter how he learns, this is difficult!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If R. Eliezer learns the Gezerah Shavah "Pe'as- Pe'as" (to teach that "Lo Yegalechu" written regarding Kohanim applies to "v'Lo Sashchis" written regarding Yisraelim), he should obligate only for a razor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he does not learn the Gezerah Shavah, he should obligate also for scissors!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns the Gezerah Shavah. He holds that a planing tool (and tweezers) also shave.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TATOOING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Tattooing (is done by making incisions in the skin and writing with dye, which gets absorbed in the skin):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is liable only if he wrote <i>and</i> made incisions;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He is liable for writing with dye, mascara or anything that makes a lasting impression.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon says, he is liable only if he writes Hash-m's name - "u'Chsoves Ka'a'ka Lo Sitnu Bachem Ani Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Acha brei d'Rava) Question:</span> Must he write 'Ani Hashem'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> R. Shimon does not refer to Hash-m's name;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Bar Kapara - Beraisa):</span> He is liable only if he writes the name of idolatry - "... Ani Hash-m", and no other (god is Hash-m).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Malkiya):</span> One may not put ashes on a wound, because it looks like a tattoo.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Chanina brei d'Rav Ika):</span> (Rav Malkiya taught three teachings, and Rav Malkiyo taught three.) Rav Malkiyo taught about spit, slaves, and hair follicles;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Malkiya taught about Bluris (hair that is grown long and shaved off for the sake of idolatry), ashes, and cheese.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Papa):</span> Rav Malkiya taught the teachings that explain Mishnayos and Beraisos. Rav Malkiya taught the teachings that have no source in the Tana'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The versions argue regarding slaves (Rav Papa attributes it to Rav Malkiya. Some say that they also argue about ashes; Rav Papa attributes it to Rav Malkiyo).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav Bivi bar Abaye was careful not to put ashes even on a bloodletting wound.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Wherever there is a wound, it is permitted (all recognize that this is for healing).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MULTIPLE LASHES FOR REPEATED TRANSGRESSIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Nazir was drinking wine (or exposing himself to Tum'as Mes, or shaving his hair) all day, he is lashed only once. If he was warned repeatedly, he is lashed for each warning he transgressed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a man was wearing Sha'atnez all day, he is lashed only once. If he was warned repeatedly, and he removed the garment and put it on again, he is lashed for each time.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One can be lashed eight times for plowing one furrow:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He plows with a Hekdesh ox and donkey;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He plows where Kil'ayim was planted in a vineyard, in Shemitah, on Yom Tov;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He is a Kohen and a Nazir plowing over Tum'as Mes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chananya ben Chakinai says, he can be lashed also for wearing Kil'ayim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> That is not due to plowing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chananya:</span> Also Tum'ah of a Nazir is not due to plowing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Bivi):</span> He need not remove the garment and put it on again. Rather, even if he removed his arm from the sleeve and puts it in again, he is liable for each time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika demonstrated this ('Rashi' on the Rif; Rivan - he gestured that he must remove and put back on the entire garment).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Even if he wears it long enough to remove it and put it on again, he is lashed (for each warning).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>LASHES FOR <i>KIL'AYIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> For plowing one furrow...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> Rabanan concluded that one who covers seeds of Kil'ayim is lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Our Mishnah teaches this. One of the eight sets of lashes is for Kil'ayim. Surely, this is for covering seeds of Kil'ayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Yanai:</span> You found the support because I told you the law!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Reish Lakish:</span> Had R. Yanai not agreed with you, I would have said that the Mishnah is like R. Akiva, who says that one is lashed for being Mekayem Kil'ayim! (Aruch - he leaves it in his field; Tosfos (4B DH Ha) - he makes a fence to protect it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where do we find that R. Akiva says so?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> One who weeds, or covers Kil'ayim is lashed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva says, even one who is Mekayem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Question:</span> "Sadcha Lo Sizra Kil'ayim" forbids only seeding. What is the source to forbid Mekayem?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (The previous word is Kil'ayim, so we read) "Kil'ayim Sadcha Lo" (Kil'ayim may not be in your field).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>OTHER POSSIBLE LASHES FOR PLOWING ONE FURROW</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Ula):</span> He should be lashed also for planting on Yom Tov (because the plowing helps the Kil'ayim grow, like we established)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> Indeed, he is. The Tana omitted this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Ula):</span> The Tana said that one can be lashed eight times. You cannot say that he omitted something!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Melachos of Yom Tov are not separated (one is lashed only once even if he does several Melachos at the same time).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Ula:</span> That is a good answer.</p>
