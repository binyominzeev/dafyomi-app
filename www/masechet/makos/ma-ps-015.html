<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LAV HA'NITAK L'ASEH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah citing R. Yochanan):</span> If an Aseh precedes (can be fulfilled even before transgressing) a Lav, we do not consider this a Lav she'Nitak l'Aseh. One is lashed for the Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rabanan (Rashi - to R. Yochanan; Ritva - to Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Did you really say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan (or Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> No.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> He did say it, and our Mishnah supports it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Vi'Shalchu Min ha'Machaneh (is an Aseh for Teme'im to leave the Mikdash). "V'Lo Yetam'u Es Machaneihem (is a Lav forbidding Teme'im in the Mikdash)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who enters the Mikdash when Tamei (is lashed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he retract?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is because a Me'anes (rapist) is not lashed (for divorcing her).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Yisrael raped a woman and divorced her, he remarries her, and he is not lashed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a Kohen did so, he cannot remarry her, so he is lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A Yisrael is not lashed, even though the Aseh precedes the Lav!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> The Torah did not have to say "v'Lo Sihyeh l'Ishah" regarding a rapist. We could have learned from Motzi Shem Ra:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Motzi Shem Ra did not do an action, yet he must marry her (if she wants). All the more so, one who raped her must marry her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since we do not need "v'Lo Sihyeh l'Ishah" to teach that he must marry her, we use it to teach that if he divorces her, he must remarry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn a rapist from Motzi Shem Ra. The latter is more stringent, for he is lashed and pays!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, the Torah did not have to say "v'Lo Sihyeh l'Ishah" regarding Motzi Shem Ra. We could have learned from a rapist;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A rapist is not lashed, yet he must marry her. All the more so, Motzi Shem Ra must marry her, for he is lashed and pays!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since we do not need "v'Lo Sihyeh l'Ishah" to teach that he must marry her, we use it to teach that if he divorces her, he must remarry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn Motzi Shem Ra from a rapist. The latter is more stringent, for he did an action!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, the Torah did not have to say "v'Lo Sihyeh l'Ishah" regarding Motzi Shem Ra, for he is already married to her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not need it to teach that a Motzi Shem Ra must marry her, so we use it to teach that if a rapist divorces her, he must remarry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should use it to teach that if Motzi Shem Ra divorces her he is not lashed (rather, he remarries her)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, that is true. We learn a rapist from Motzi Shem Ra.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> How do we learn?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We cannot learn from a Kal va'Chomer or Mah Matzinu (precedent). Motzi Shem Ra did not do an action (therefore, he is not lashed)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rava, and Ravin citing R. Yochanan):</span> Rather, "Lo Yuchal Leshalchah Kol Yamav" - he is forever commanded to remarry her (if he will divorce her. This Aseh is after he transgresses, therefore he is not lashed. Ritva - this was R. Yochanan's reason all along. Rashi would say that after he retracted, he found a defense of his original teaching.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> (R. Yochanan says that one is lashed for a Lav preceded by an Aseh.) This is unlike the Lav of muzzling (the paradigm Lav for which one is lashed)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It is no worse just because an Aseh precedes the Lav!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If so, we should say the same about a Lav she'Nitak l'Aseh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> There, the Aseh comes to avert the lashes!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>BITLO</i> <i>V'LO</i> <i>BITLO</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand according to the opinion (that lashes depend on) Bitlo v'Lo Bitlo (whether or not he made it impossible to fulfill the Aseh). As long as he can remarry her, he is not lashed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, according to the opinion (that lashes depend on) Kiymo v'Lo Kiymo (whether or not he fulfilled the Aseh), if he does not remarry her immediately, he is lashed!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">15b----------------------------------------15b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are answering for R. Yochanan. He holds Bitlo v'Lo Bitlo (like the following dialogue shows).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(A reciter of Beraisos):</span> If a Lav has (is Nitak to) an Aseh, if (one transgressed and) fulfilled the Aseh; he is not lashed. If he was Mevatel the Aseh, he is lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> That is inconsistent!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If you say 'if he fulfilled the Aseh, he is not lashed', you must say 'if he did not fulfill it, he is lashed';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If you say 'if he was Mevatel the Aseh, he is lashed', you must say 'if he did not Mevatel it, he is not lashed'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The correct text is 'if he was Mevatel the Aseh, he is lashed. If not, he is not lashed.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> It depends on Kiymo v'Lo Kiymo.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of their argument?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about whether or not Safek warning is considered warning;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan says that it is good warning. He holds Bitlo v'Lo Bitlo, so the Lav is not 'complete' until he is Mevatel the Aseh;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>At the time he transgresses the Lav, we can give only Safek warning (we do not know whether or not he will Mevatel the Aseh. Nevertheless, he is lashed);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reish Lakish says that it is not proper warning. He holds Kiymo v'Lo Kiymo, so one is lashed for the Lav itself (just he can exempt himself from lashes if he will fulfill the Aseh). He receives definite warning.</p>
