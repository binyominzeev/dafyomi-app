<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HONORING THE <i>MITZVOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana) Question:</span> "Veha'Bor Rek Ein Bo Mayim" - obviously, if the pit is empty it does not have water!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This implies that it did not have water, but it had snakes and scorpions (it was a Nes that Yosef survived).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Mitzvah is to leave Ner Chanukah [in the Chatzer or Reshus ha'Rabim] within a Tefach of the opening [to his house].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where (on which side) does he leave it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> He leaves it on the right side (of one who enters).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Shmuel mi'Difti):</span> He leaves it on the left.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The Halachah is, he leaves it on the left, in order that [he will be surrounded by Mitzvos,] Ner Chanukah will be on his left and the Mezuzah on his right.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> It is forbidden to count coins near (using) the light of Ner Chanukah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Shmuel):</span> Does Ner Chanukah have Kedushah (that it is forbidden to benefit from it)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (to the objection - Rav Yosef):</span> Blood does not have Kedushah [yet the Mitzvah to cover it must be done honorably]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Shafach...v'Chisahu" - he must cover with the same limb he used to slaughter, i.e. his hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He may not cover with his foot, lest Mitzvos would be disgraceful in his eyes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Here also, one may not count coins near the Ner, lest Mitzvos would be disgraceful in his eyes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May one use Noyei (decorations of a) Sukah during the seven days [of Sukos]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> It is forbidden to count coins near Ner Chanukah (likewise, Noyei Sukah are forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> A Beraisa explicitly teaches about Noyei Sukah, why does he learn this from Ner Chanukah, which was not taught (by Tana'im)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Sukah had the proper amount of Sechach, and one adorned it with colorful illustrated curtains and sheets, and hung nuts, peaches, almonds, pomegranates, twigs with grapes clusters, crowns on ears [of grain], wines, oils and flour, it is forbidden to use [or eat] them until after Simchas Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he stipulated [that he may use them during Bein ha'Shemashos of the first night], it works (they do not become forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> We learn all Mitzvos (that one may not disgrace them) from [covering] blood.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>NOT DISGRACING <i>MITZVOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One may not light a Ner Chanukah from another Ner Chanukah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One may not remove Tzitzis from a garment to attach them to another garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Shimon regarding dragging (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Wherever Rav and Shmuel argue, my Rebbi (Rabah) always followed [the stringencies of] Rav, except for these three Halachos:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> It is permitted to drag a bed, chair or bench [on a dirt floor], as long as he does not intend to make a furrow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(A Chacham):</span> Rav forbids lighting one Ner from another Ner on account of disgrace to the Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> Do not heed him - Rav forbids because it looks like he weakens the Mitzvah (detracts from its light).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these opinions?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about lighting a Ner Chanukah directly from another:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Chacham who said that Rav forbids on account of disgrace to the Mitzvah would permit, since he uses the Ner only for the sake of another Mitzvah (Rav only forbids lighting [something else, e.g.] a chip from a Ner in order that light another);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Ada forbids, for in any case it looks like he weakens the Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Ada - Rav Avya - Beraisa):</span> One may not weigh gold Dinarim against coins of Ma'aser Sheni, even for the sake of redeeming Ma'aser Sheni on them.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Rav and Shmuel argue about lighting a Ner directly from another, but all forbid lighting through a chip, this is not difficult;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if both permit lighting a Ner directly from another, and Shmuel permits lighting through a chip, this would refute him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> The Beraisa forbids weighing against coins of Ma'aser Sheni, lest the gold Dinarim will not be the correct weight and he will not redeem with them, and it will turn out that he used Ma'aser Sheni for naught!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes - Beraisa) Question:</span> (The Menorah is) "Mi'Chutz l'Faroches ha'Edus...Ya'aroch" - Hash-m does not need the light, the 40 years in the Midbar, Hash-m illuminated for Yisrael (with a pillar of fire)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Menorah is Edus (testimony) that the Shechinah dwells amidst Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the testimony?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> The testimony was the Ner Ma'aravi (according to the opinion that the (length of the) Menorah is north-south, the middle lamp tilts westward; according to the opinion that it is east-west, this refers to the more western of the two easternmost lamps</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The same amount of oil was put in all the lamps; the others were lit [before evening] from the Ner Ma'aravi; they would finish burning in the morning, it kept burning until the next evening.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> The Neros were fixed in the Menorah, they can only be lit through an intermediary (even if a Ner could light an adjacent Ner, the Ner Ma'arivi could not reach to the Ner at the end) - this is difficult [for Shmuel] according to both versions of the argument!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> The Neros had long wicks, it was possible to light all directly from the Ner Ma'aravi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>In any case, this is difficult for Rav Ada.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the conclusion?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> If the Mitzvah is Hadlakah (to light Neros Chanukah), it is permitted to light Neros directly from each other; if the Mitzvah is Hanachah (to place the Neros in the proper place), it is forbidden (he uses the Neros for something which is only preparation for a Mitzvah).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT IS THE <i>MITZVAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is the Mitzvah Hadlakah or Hanachah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rava taught that if someone held Ner Chanukah [until it extinguished], he did not fulfill the Mitzvah (this shows that Hanachah is the Mitzvah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, he was not Yotzei because it looks like he needs the light (he did not publicize the Nes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rava taught that if one lit inside and took it outside he was not Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand this if the Mitzvah is Hadlakah - Hanachah must be in the place of Hadlakah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if the Mitzvah is Hanachah, why wasn't he Yotzei?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There also, he was not Yotzei because it looks like he needs the light.</p>
