<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IS <i>TEVILAH BI'ZMANAH</i> A MITZVAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yosi does not hold that Tevilah bi'Zmanah Mitzvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following immerse during the day - a Zav, Zavah, Metzora, Metzora'as, Bo'el Nidah, and Tamei Mes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Nidah and Yoledes immerse at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A Ba'al Keri may immerse at any time during the day;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yosi says, if his emission was after [he prayed] Minchah, he need not immerse during the day (he can immerse at night before praying Ma'ariv).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That opinion is really of R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah, who says that it suffices for her to immerse at the end [regarding a woman who does not know when she gave birth - others require her to immerse every day that <i>could</i> be her first opportunity to become Tehorah].</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ALLOWING OTHERS TO EXTINGUISH A FIRE ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Nochri comes to extinguish, [the owners of the burning properly] do not (i.e. may not) tell him to extinguish, nor do (must) they tell him not to extinguish, because his rest on Shabbos is not their responsibility;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>But if a minor comes to extinguish, they do not allow him, for it is their responsibility that he rest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Ami):</span> Regarding a fire, Chachamim permitted to say [in front of Nochrim] 'Anyone who extinguishes will not lose!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> If a Nochri comes to extinguish, they do not tell him to extinguish, or not to extinguish, because his rest is not their responsibility.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> They may not tell him to extinguish - but they may say 'Anyone who extinguishes will not lose!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It also says that they do not tell him not to extinguish.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> They need not tell him to extinguish - but they may not say 'Anyone who extinguishes will not lose!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> [The inferences contradict one another - we cannot determine which is correct,] the Mishnah neither supports nor refutes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A case occurred, a fire erupted in the Chatzer of Yosef ben Simai; the authorities (Nochrim) of Tzipori came to extinguish it, for Yosef was the overseer of the king's money - he did not allow them, on account of the honor of Shabbos (lest people think that he asked them to extinguish);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A miracle occurred, rain fell and extinguished it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>At night, he sent two Sela'im to everyone [that came to extinguish but consented to refrain] and 50 Sela'im to the mayor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>When Chachamim heard about this, they said that he did not need to stop them - it was taught that if a Nochri comes to extinguish, they do not tell him to extinguish, or not to extinguish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> But if a minor comes to extinguish, they do not allow him, for it is their responsibility that he rest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If a child is eating Neveilos [or doing any Isur], Beis Din [and all of Yisrael] must stop him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Yochanan):</span> The case is the child comes to extinguish because the father wants this [but others need not stop him]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, likewise the Nochri [in the Reisha] does so for the sake of the Yisrael - but this is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Nochri acts for his own sake.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>COVERING EXCREMENT ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may put a bowl over a Ner to prevent the ceiling beam from catching fire, and over excrement of a child, and over a scorpion so it will not bite;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, a case occurred - R. Yochanan ben Zakai said that he suspects that the person is Chayav Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Rav Yehudah, R. Yirmeyah bar Aba and Rav Chanan bar Rava visited the house of Avin of Nashikiya; Rav Yehudah and R. Yirmiyah were given beds to lie on, but not Rav Chanan. Rav Chanan heard Avin teaching to his son 'over excrement of a child on account of a child (lest he play with it)'.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">121b----------------------------------------121b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chanan:</span> Avin the fool teaches folly to his son! Excrement itself is fitting for a dog (we need not give other reasons to permit covering it! Bava Kama 92b - dogs eat Glalei (excrement) when they are hungry; Rashi prefers to say (there) that 'Glalei' refers to rocks, for dogs normally eat excrement.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps another reason is needed because the excrement was not ready from before Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> One may take [water from] flowing rivers and springs wherever he may go [even if it came from outside his Techum - since he knows that the river flows, he intends to use water that will come - likewise, he may use excrement, for he knows that it will come].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Avin:</span> What should I teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chanan:</span> You should teach 'over excrement of a chicken (dogs do not eat it) on account of a child.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should be permitted because it is Geraf Shel Re'i (a Kli for excrement)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps excrement may be moved only Agav (along with) a Kli.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A mouse was found in Rav Ashi's spices - he commanded to remove it by its tail.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mishnah discusses excrement in a wasteheap [in Reshus ha'Rabim; one may move Geraf Shel Re'i only if it is in a place where it bothers him].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [If so, we should not be concerned -] children would not be in a wasteheap [in Reshus ha'Rabim]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The excrement is in a Chatzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One may move Geraf Shel Re'i in a Chatzer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The excrement is in a wasteheap in a Chatzer.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>KILLING DANGEROUS ANIMALS ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ...And over a scorpion so it will not bite.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> One may kill any damager on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> Five animals may be killed on Shabbos - a fly in Mitzrayim, a wasp in Ninveh, a scorpion in Chadayev, a snake in Eretz Yisrael, or a rabid dog anywhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot be R. Yehudah - he is Mechayev Melachah she'Einah Tzerichah l'Gufah (he could not permit unless there is mortal danger, and then any animal could be killed)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is R. Shimon, and he permits only these five!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmiyah):</span> Perhaps the Beraisa is mistaken (it is not a Tosefta)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to both questions - Rav Yosef):</span> The case is, they are pursuing him (these animals pose mortal danger), the Beraisa is like both Tana'im (Tosfos; Rashi - R. Yehoshua ben Levi discusses when they are pursuing him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(A reciter of Beraisos):</span> If one kills snakes and scorpions on Shabbos, Chasidim are displeased with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rava bar Rav Huna:</span> Chachamim are displeased with these Chasidim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>He argues with Rav Huna.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Huna saw a man kill a wasp [on Shabbos]. He asked, 'Did you kill them all?!' (What you did will not help.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one encountered snakes and scorpions:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he killed them, this shows that Hash-m summonsed them to give him the merit of killing them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he did not kill them, this shows that Hash-m summonsed them to kill him (for a sin), just Hash-m saved him miraculously.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> This is when they were hissing at him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">R. Aba bar Kahana:</span> Once, one of them fell into the Beis Medrash; one of the Talmidim killed it. Rebbi remarked that it met someone like it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does this mean, [it sought to kill, its intent was carried out on itself,] the Talmid acted properly?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, does it mean, [it kills needlessly, it was killed needlessly,] the Talmid acted improperly?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer - Question (R. Aba and R. Zeira):</span> May one kill snakes and scorpions on Shabbos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yanai):</span> I kill wasps - all the more so I kill snakes and scorpions!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps he permits only [to trample them] l'Fi Tumo (Rashi - in the course of walking, without overtly trying to kill them; Mishnah Berurah - he may intend, but makes it look like he does not).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One may trample spit l'Fi Tumo (Mishnah Berurah - he may intend to walk on it, he may not intend to smear it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> One may trample a snake l'Fi Tumo.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Katina):</span> One may trample a scorpion l'Fi Tumo.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Aba bar Marsa owed money to people of the Reish Galusa's house; they brought him and were paining him. There was spit in front of them (it was Shabbos) - the Reish Galusa told them to cover it with a Kli.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Aba bar Marsa:</span> There is no need to do so - Rav Yehudah permits to trample spit l'Fi Tumo!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Reish Galusa:</span> Leave him alone, he is a Chacham.</p>
