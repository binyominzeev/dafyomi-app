<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah brei d'Rav Shmuel):</span> The eulogy indicates whether or not the Mes is a Ben Olam ha'Ba (it is tearful and laudatory for a Ben Olam ha'Ba).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did Rav tell Rav Shmuel bar Shilas 'When I die, strive to eulogize me to arouse people to cry'? (Surely Rav is a Ben Olam ha'Ba, they will cry in any case!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rav Yehudah meant, if people cry when aroused, this shows that the Mes is a Ben Olam ha'Ba; if not, he is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Abaye (to Rabah):</span> [Almost] all of Pumbadisa hates you [because you rebuke them for deceit in money matters] - who will be aroused when you are eulogized?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> It suffices that you and Rabah bar Rav Chanan will be aroused.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> Who is a Ben Olam ha'Ba?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> "V'Oznecha Tishmanah Davar me'Acharecha Leimor Zeh ha'Derech Lechu Vo..." (if after he dies, people say that we should follow in his path, he is a Ben Olam ha'Ba).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chanina):</span> It is one who pleases his Rebbi'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(People of Galil):</span> "V'Sovevu va'Shuk ha'Sofdim" - do things that people will retell before your casket (at your eulogy).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(People of Yehudah):</span> "V'Sovevu va'Shuk ha'Sofdim" - do things that people will retell after your casket.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>They do not argue - in Galil they eulogize before the casket, in Yehudah, after it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> Repent one day before your death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Talmidim):</span> One does not know when he will die!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Eliezer):</span> Therefore one should repent today, lest he die tomorrow - this way, he repents every day - "B'Chol Es Yihyu Vegadecha Levanim v'Shemen Al Roshcha Al Yechsar".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan ben Zakai):</span> This is like a king who invited his servants to a feast, but he did not fix a time. The smart ones put on nice clothing and sat at the entrance to the palace, for the king does not lack anything (the feast may be at any moment). The foolish did their chores, thinking that it will take much time before a feast can be prepared.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Suddenly, the king asked them to come to the feast. The smart ones entered adorned nicely, the foolish ones entered with dirty clothing. The king was pleased by the smart ones - he let them eat and drink at the feast. He was angry at the foolish ones - he ordered that they stand and watch those enjoying the feast.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Meir):</span> If so, [the foolish ones would not be ashamed in front of the invitees -] it appears that they are serving at the feast! (But a verse teaches that Resha'im will be embarrassed!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, both of them sit at the feast - the smart ones eat and drink, the foolish ones sit hungry and thirsty - "Hine Avadai Yochelu v'Atem Tir'avu Hine Avadai Yishtu v'Atem Titzma'u...; Hine Avadai Yaronu mi'Tuv Lev v'Atem Titz'aku mi'Ke'ev Lev".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Alternatively - "B'Chol Es Yihyu Vegadecha Levanim" refers to Tzitzis, "V'Shemen Al Roshcha Al Yechsar" refers to Tefilin.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HAVING A <i>NOCHRI</i> TO CARRY ONE'S ITEMS ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was on the road when Shabbos was about to come, he may give his wallet to a Nochri [before Shabbos, to take it home for him];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If no Nochri is around, he puts it on his donkey; when he reaches the outer gate [of the city], he removes from the donkey Kelim which may be moved on Shabbos, and unties the ropes [holding up sacks with Muktzeh], the sacks fall by themselves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> [Normally, mid'Rabanan, one may not ask a Nochri to do Melachah on Shabbos -] why did Chachamim allow one to give his wallet to a Nochri [to take it home for him]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim know that a person cannot control himself if he stands to lose much money - if we do not allow him a way to save it, he might carry it four Amos in Reshus ha'Rabim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This is permitted only for his wallet, not for a found object.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious - the Mishnah permits a wallet!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought, the same applies to a found object - the Mishnah discusses a wallet, for this is the usual case - Rava teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> A found object is forbidden only if he did not yet pick it up - but if he already picked it up, it is permitted like his wallet;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question (Rava):</span> What is the law regarding a found object that he already picked up?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since he already picked it up, it is like his wallet;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since he did not toil to acquire it, it is unlike his wallet (he is not frantic about losing it; he must leave it there, we are not concerned lest he carry it in Reshus ha'Rabim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If no Nochri is around [he puts it on his donkey].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If a Nochri is around he must give it to him [he may not put it on his own donkey].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is commanded that his donkey rest, he is not commanded that the Nochri rest.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHO SHOULD ONE GIVE ONE'S ITEMS TO CARRY ON SHABBOS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>If a donkey, minor, lunatic and Cheresh (deaf person) are all available, he should put it on the donkey, not one of the others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are people (they can be confused with healthy adults, perhaps people will come to give to healthy adults), the donkey is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If only a minor, lunatic and Cheresh are available, he should give it to the lunatic (he has no understanding, not to one of the others).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If only a minor and Cheresh are available, to whom should he give it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not ask according to R. Eliezer (he never permits to give to a Cheresh);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> [If a Cheresh was Torem (separated Terumah) to Metaken (permit) Tevel, one may not eat the Tevel until a healthy person is Metaken it; nevertheless,] the Chereh's Terumah may not be eaten like Chulin, because he is a Safek (doubtfully obligated in Mitzvos).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">153b----------------------------------------153b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We ask according to Chachamim:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Five types of people cannot Torem, even b'Diavad it is not Terumah - a Cheresh (he is definitely exempt from Mitzvos), lunatic, minor, one who does not own the produce, and a Nochri who is Torem to Metaken produce of a Yisrael, even with permission.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Perhaps we give to the Cheresh, [but not the minor,] because the minor will later be commanded to keep Mitzvos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Or, perhaps we must give to the minor, for the Cheresh can be confused with a healthy adult!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer:</span> We give to the Cheresh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer:</span> We give to the minor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If no Nochri, donkey, minor, lunatic and Cheresh is available, what should he do?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> Chachamim had another Heter, they did not want to reveal it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He carries it less than four Amos at a time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't they want to reveal it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Kevod Elokim Hester Davar (one may cover up Halachos l'Shem Shomayim) u'Chvod Melachim Chakur Davar" (one should not cover up things on account of a person's honor or wealth).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does covering up this Halachah honor Hash-m?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [If one intends to carry less than four Amos at a time], he might [accidentally] carry four Amos at once in Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> (Chachamim sought to bury Sefer Yechezkeil, for it [seemingly] contradicts the Torah; Chachamim gathered in the attic of Chananyah ben Chizkiyah and resolved the difficulties.) That day, [18 decrees were made - one was to forbid carrying less than four Amos at a time if a Nochri is around -] Chachamim made an ample fence for Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>R. Yehoshua says, that day Chachamim were too restrictive (people cannot abide by this decree, e.g. if they do not trust the Nochri, they may come to transgress Torah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A parable for R. Eliezer's opinion - there was a box full of gourds; if one puts in mustard seeds, the box can hold them (they fall into the spaces - likewise, the additional decree was sound).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>A parable for R. Yehoshua's opinion - there was a tub full of honey; if one puts in pomegranates and nuts, they will make the honey spill out (the loss far outweighs the anticipated gain).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>HOW THE DONKEY CARRIES ONE'S ITEMS HOME ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If no Nochri is around [he puts it on his donkey].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is Machemer [making an animal work] - but it says "Lo Sa'aseh Chol Melachah [...u'Vhemtecha]"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> One puts the wallet on while the donkey is walking (there was not an Akirah, it does not do a Melachah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, it will stop to urinate or eliminate (when it resumes to walk, this is Akirah - there will be Hanachah the next time it stops, or at the end)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One puts the wallet on while the donkey is walking, and removes it when it stops (and does not return it until it starts again - Rashi; Rambam - one senses when it is preparing to stop and removes it before it stops, so it will not even do Hanachah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should be permitted even to put it on a Yisrael to carry this way! (We have no source to permit Reuven to carry Shimon's Muktzeh out of concern lest Shimon do a Melachah! Perhaps we ask why the Mishnah does not permit saving valuables that are not Muktzeh (e.g. a silver cup) in this way, or to carry Muktzeh in his mouth - <b>PF</b>.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Anything for which one is liable (if he does it entirely himself), if he does it with another person he is exempt, but it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Anything which one may not do with another person, but he is exempt for it, it is permitted to do so with a donkey.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> If one was carrying a load on his shoulder [from before Shabbos], he may run to his house [on Shabbos];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is permitted only if he runs - he may not walk slowly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [If he walks,] since he has no reminder [not to stop], he may inadvertently [stop, and thereby] do Akirah and Hanachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When he reaches his house, he must stop momentarily to open the door - he is Machnis from Reshus ha'Rabim to Reshus ha'Yachid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He throws it into the house in an awkward way [one is exempt for this; in this case it is permitted].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rami bar Chama):</span> If one is Mechamer (causes an animal to work) on Shabbos b'Shogeg, he is Chayav Chatas; b'Mezid he is stoned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> "Lo Sa'aseh Chol Melachah Ata ...u'Vhemtecha" - the Torah equates his animal to him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like he is Chayav Chatas or stoning [if he does Melachah], the same applies to Mechamer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rava):</span> "Torah Achas Yihyeh Lachem la'Oseh bi'Shgagah" - the entire Torah is equated to idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like one is liable for idolatry for doing an act himself, the same applies to other Aveiros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Rava - Mishnah):</span> If one was Mechalel Shabbos, and did something which is Chayav Chatas b'Shogeg [he is Chayav Skilah b'Mezid; Rashash - these last words are Rava's explanation of the Mishnah];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> There is Chilul Shabbos for which one is not Chayav Chatas or Skilah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is Mechamer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No - it is the Isur to leave the Techum - our Mishnah is like R. Akiva, who forbids this mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> No - it is burning - our Mishnah is R. Yosi, who says that burning is only a Lav.</p>
