<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LARGE UTENSILS THAT ARE <i>TAMEI</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> According to Chananyah, if a boat can be moved empty and full through oxen, it is considered movable empty and full:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are three kinds of wagons [regarding Tum'ah]:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it is [short] like a chair, it is Tamei Medras;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If it is like a bed, it is Tamei Mes (and all Tum'os except for Medras);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>If it is made to carry rocks, it is absolutely Tahor (there are big holes in the bottom - a wooden Kli which cannot hold pomegranates is Tahor),</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If it can hold pomegranates, it is Tamei Mes [even though only oxen can move it when full].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are three kinds of boxes:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it opens from the side, it is Tamei Medras (it can be used even when one sits on it);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If it opens from the top, it is Tamei Mes;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>If it is too big to carry empty and full, it is absolutely Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Medras of Klei Cheres is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi says, even a boat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Zevid):</span> The first Tana teaches that Klei Cheres are not Mekabel Tum'as Medras, they are Mekabel Tum'as Maga; a Cheres boat is Tamei, like Chananyah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi is Metaher a boat, like our Tana (i.e. of our Mishnah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Papa):</span> If so, R. Yosi should not say have said '<i>even</i> [a boat]'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> The first Tana teaches that Klei Cheres are not Mekabel Tum'as Medras, they are Mekabel Tum'as Maga; Klei Etz are Mekabel Tum'as Medras and Maga;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sefinas ha'Yarden is Tahor, like our Tana;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, even a boat is Tamei, like Chananyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Klei Cheres are not Mekabel Tum'as Medras?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chizkiyah):</span> "V'Ish Asher Yiga b'Mishkavo" - this equates a Mishkav to a Zav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a Zav can become Tahor through immersion, also the Mishkav [that becomes an Av ha'Tum'ah] must have Taharah through immersion (Klei Cheres do not).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (D'vei R. Yishmael - Beraisa):</span> "K'Mishkav Nidasah Yihyeh Lah" - this equates a Mishkav to a Zavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a Zavah can become Tehorah through immersion, also the Mishkav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This excludes Klei Cheres, immersion is not Metaher them (their only Taharah is to be broken).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Ila'a - Beraisa):</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches that a reed mat is Mekabel Tum'as Mes:</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">84b----------------------------------------84b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Small flasks do not receive Tum'ah from a Zav (the opening is too small to stick his finger inside - we expound that anything that cannot Mekabel Tum'ah from his flesh does not Mekabel Tum'ah from his hair or if he moves it), yet they receive Tum'as Mes - a mat is Mekabel Tum'ah from a Zav, all the more so it is Mekabel Tum'as Mes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It says that a mat is Mekabel Tum'ah (Medras) from a Zav, even though it lacks Taharah [through immersion - when the Torah discusses immersion of Kelim, Peshutei Klei Etz (that do not hold anything) are not mentioned]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina):</span> A mat is Mekabel Tum'as Medras because other Kelim of its kind (Klei Etz that hold things) become Tehorim though immersion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">R. Ila'a:</span> May Hash-m save us from such reasoning!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> No, may Hash-m save us from your reasoning!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Chanina's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer - Question:</span> It says "V'Ish Asher Yiga b'Mishkavo" (implying only Kelim that can be immersed), and it says "V'Chol ha'Mishkav Asher Yishkav Alav Yitma" (it does not say b'Mishkavo - this implies, even if it cannot be immersed)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If other Kelim of its kind can be immersed, it is Mekabel Tum'as Medras, even if it itself cannot be immersed; if no Kli of its kind can be immersed, it is not Mekabel Tum'as Medras.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question (h) - Rava):</span> We learn that Klei Cheres are not Mekabel Tum'as Medras from "V'Chol Kli Fasu'ach Asher Ein Tzamid Pasil Alav" (a Kli Cheres that is not fully sealed becomes Tamei in Ohel ha'Mes);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If it has a Tzamid Pasil, it is Tahor (nothing can touch its inside - Klei Cheres Mekabel Tum'ah only from their inside)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Torah is Metaher in every case, even if it was designated for a Nidah to sit on. (Ri -if it <i>could</i> Mekabel Tum'as Medras, it would not block Tum'as Ohel even if it was Tahor; R. Tam - it is Mekabel Tum'ah if a Nidah moves it, that is like touching it internally - it is not Mekabel any Tum'ah from the outside.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DIVERSE SEEDS IN A PATCH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Question: What is the source to permit planting five kinds of seeds in a patch six by six Tefachim, i.e. one on each other the four sides, and one in the middle? (Rashi - a single seed is sown in the middle, it is three Tefachim from each of the sides; even though there is no separation between species on adjacent sides, since it is Nikar (evident) that they are not growing together, it is permitted.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ki Cha'Aretz Totzi Tzimchah uch'Ginah <i>Zeru'eha</i> Satzmi'ach" - Zeru'eha is plural (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> How do we learn this from the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> "Totzi" alludes to one, "Tzimchah" alludes to one, "Zeru'eha" alludes to two, and "Satzmi'ach" alludes to one;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We know that six by six Tefachim is the area needed in order that they will not nurture from each other [when there is no Heker, i.e. the middle and a side. The verse does not teach this Shi'ur; Tosfos - a verse in Shir ha'Shirim alludes to it.]</p>
