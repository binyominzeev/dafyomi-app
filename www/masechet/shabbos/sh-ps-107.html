<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven sat in the doorway and filled it, and Shimon sat next to him, even if Reuven left and Shimon remained, Reuven is liable and Shimon is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Shimon is exempt, but it is forbidden to remain!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he is exempt and permitted [to do so].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Seifa):</span> [Shimon] is like one who locked his house to guard the contents, and a deer was found inside.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that he is exempt and permitted.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Shimon is exempt, and permitted [to do so]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, he is exempt and forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection of rejection (Seifa):</span> He is like one who looked his house to guard the contents, and a deer was found inside.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that he is exempt and permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> All Peturim in the Mishnayos regarding Shabbos are forbidden [mid'Rabanan], with three exceptions, which are permitted - this is one of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that it is permitted here?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Seifa):</span> [Shimon] is like one who looked his house to guard the contents, and a deer was found inside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Exception #2 (Mishnah):</span> If one pierces an abscess to make an opening, he is liable; if it is to let out the pus [now, and he does not care if it closes], he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that it is permitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> A hand needle (used to sew garments) may be moved, for it is useful to remove a thorn [stuck in one's skin - even though this surely wounds, Melachah she'Einah Tzerichah l'Gufah is permitted to alleviate pain, the same applies to an abscess].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Exception #3 (Mishnah):</span> If one traps a snake on Shabbos - if this was so it will not bite him, he is exempt; if this was to use it for a cure, he is liable.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> One may put a bowl over a Ner to prevent the ceiling beam from catching fire, and over excrement of a child, and over a scorpion so it will not bite.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK SHEMONEH SHERATZIM</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LIABILITY FOR WOUNDING <i>SHERATZIM</i> ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>If one traps or wounds any of the eight Sheratzim listed in the Torah he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Regarding other Shekatzim u'Rmashim (vermin):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one wounds them he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he traps them for a need he is liable; if it was not for a need, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one traps animals or birds in his domain, he is exempt; if he wounds them he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> If one is liable for wounding [the eight Sheratzim], they must have skin (i.e. the wound will not heal, this is a Toladah of slaughtering; alternatively, the Chiyuv for wounding is for coloring the skin via blood).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> It is R. Yochanan ben Nuri:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yochanan ben Nuri):</span> The eight Sheratzim have skin [that is Halachically different than their flesh].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> It is even like Chachamim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(In Chulin 122A, Chachamim list some of the eight, for which ka'Adashah of skin [of a Nevelah] is Tamei like their flesh.) Chachamim argue with R. Yochanan ben Nuri only regarding Tum'ah, for it says "Eleh ha'Teme'im Lachem", to teach that their skin is like their flesh - but regarding Shabbos, they agree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> They also argue regarding Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yochanan ben Nuri):</span> If one traps any of the eight Sheratzim or wounds it, he is liable (perhaps the Bach's Hagahah (Beis) belongs here - Oz v'Hadar);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, only the Sheratzim that Chachamim listed have skin.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">107b----------------------------------------107b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Just the contrary - Chachamim listed the Sheratzim whose skin is <i>the same</i> as their flesh! (The Beraisa is errant.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Correction #1 (Abaye):</span> Rather, Chachamim say, only the Sheratzim that Chachamim <i>did not</i> list have skin different than their flesh [but one is exempt for wounding the ones listed, i.e. they argue about Shabbos]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> The text says...'only the Sheratzim that Chachamim <i>listed</i> have skin' (it is unreasonable to say that the text was totally reversed)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (and Correction #2 - Rava):</span> Rather, Chachamim say, skin is Metamei like the flesh only regarding the Sheratzim that Chachamim listed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This implies that R. Yochanan ben Nuri holds that the skin of all eight is Metamei like the flesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> But in the Mishnah he says that the eight Sheratzim have skin [that is not Metamei like the flesh]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (and Correction #3 - Rav Ada bar Masnah):</span> Rather, Chachamim say, regarding Tum'ah, only the Sheratzim that Chachamim listed have skin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We have a different source that they argue regarding Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one traps any of the eight Sheratzim or wounds one of the Sheratzim with skin, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the blood gathers in one place, even if it did not leave, the wound will not recover.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yochanan ben Nuri says, all eight Sheratzim have skin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The first Tana is R. Yehudah, who says that it depends on the thickness of the skin:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> A lizard is like a rat (its skin is not Tamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim argue with R. Yochanan ben Nuri only about Tum'ah, not about Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, [in the Beraisa] why was R. Yochanan ben Nuri's law [regarding wounding] said only in his name - it should have been said also in the name of Chachamim that argue with him [about Tum'ah]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, it should say 'R. Yochanan ben Nuri and the Chachamim that argue with him say...'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Levi):</span> What is the source that a wound does not recover?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer - Question:</span> "Ha'Yahafoch Kushi Oro v'Namer <i>Chavarburosav</i>": what are these?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It refers to [a leopard's] spots.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, it should have said 'Gavanav' (his colors)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it [refers to a wound and] equates it to a Kushi (negro) - just like a Kushi cannot change his skin, a wound cannot revert to normal skin.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LIABILITY FOR KILLING ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Regarding other Shekatzim u'Rmashim (if one wounds them he is exempt).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he kills them he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmiyah):</span> It is R. Eliezer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If one kills a louse on Shabbos he is [liable] like one who kills a camel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (and Answer #2 -Rav Yosef):</span> Chachamim argue with R. Eliezer only regarding lice, for they do not reproduce [sexually], but they agree that one is liable for other Shekatzim u'Rmashim which reproduce! The footnote in Michtav me'Eliyahu (Vol 4, p.355 (4)) says in the name of the author that accepted Halachos are not changed by scientific discoveries, e.g. one may kill lice even though we find that they do reproduce sexually - Chachamim transmitted known Halachos which are not dependent on the explanations given. Menuchas Ahavah (3:18:6) suggests that since they cannot hatch without sweat, this is not considered reproduction from male and female [<i>alone</i>]. He cites (in the appendix) the Rambam and others who say Chazal's words on matters like this were not all based on prophecy, tradition or Ru'ach ha'Kodesh. The Yerushalmi says that one may kill lice because they have meager life (anything without a spine cannot live more than six months), but the Bavli argues with this (it obligates for killing a Pir'osh).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Both of them learn from rams (which were slaughtered for their skins for the curtains).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer says, just like they were killed, one is liable for killing anything;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, just like they reproduce, one is liable for anything that reproduces.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Lice do reproduce,</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It was taught that Hash-m feeds the entire world, from Karnei Re'emim [the biggest animals] to Beitzei Kinim (lice that just hatched).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beitzei Kinim is the name of a species (other than lice).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Tipuyei (a small insect) and Beitzei Kinim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beitzei Kinim is the name of a species.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Pir'osh reproduces, yet R. Yehoshua exempts! (Bi'ur Halachah (316:9 Lehargah) - Rambam says that Pir'osh is a flea - those that arise spontaneously from dirt (but not those that arises from mold) can reproduce. Ramban - anything that does not come from male and female cannot reproduce - Pir'osh must be some other species.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If one traps a Pir'osh on Shabbos he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Trapping is unlike killing!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer obligates even if the species is not normally hunted, R. Yehoshua exempts in such a case - but R. Yehoshua agrees that he is liable for killing them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he traps them for a need he is liable; [if it was not for a need, he is exempt].</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is R. Shimon, who exempts Melachah she'Einah Tzerichah l'Gufah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Beraisa):</span> If one punctures a blister [with pus inside] on Shabbos:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it was to make a (Rashi - permanent) opening (Tosfos 3A u'Mafis - also to let in air), he is liable, if it was just to let out pus, he is exempt.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If one removes a fish [that was already trapped before Shabbos] from the sea, once the size of a Sela (a coin) dries up, he is liable [for killing it, for it will not live].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Avin):</span> This is if the area that dries is between its fins.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> It need not become fully dry - it suffices if sticky strands exude when one touches it.</p>
