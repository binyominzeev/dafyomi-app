<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PUNISHMENTS FOR EVIL JUDGES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi bar Elisha):</span> If you see many afflictions coming on the generation, check the judges - every punishment that comes to the world is on account of judges of Yisrael - "Shim'u Na...u'Ktzinei Beis Yisrael ha'Masa'avim Mishpat v'Es Kol ha'Ysharah Ye'akshu; ...Rosheha b'Shochad Yishpotu v'Chohaneha bi'Mchir Yoru u'Nvi'eha b'Chesef Yiksomu v'Al Hash-m Yisha'enu";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They were Resha'im, but they relied on Hash-m - therefore, they will get three punishments corresponding to their three sins (Maharsha - they will not be judged with fire, which destroys everything) - "Lachen Biglalchem Tziyon Sadeh Secharesh  vi'Yrushalayim Iyin Tihyeh v'Har ha'Bayis l'Vamos Ya'ar".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Hash-m will not rest His Shechinah on Yisrael until evil judges and enforcers cease - "V'Ashivah Yadi Alayich v'Etzrof ka'Bor Sigayich...v'Ashivah Shoftayich keva'Rishonah...[Acharei Chen Yikarei Lach Ir ha'Tzedek]".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Yerushalayim (Rambam's text - Yisrael) will be redeemed only through Tzedakah - "Tziyon b'Mishpat Tipadeh v'Shaveha bi'Tzdakah".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If haughty people cease, the Amugushi (enticers, avid idolaters that constantly blaspheme; alternatively, Parsi witches that afflict Yisrael) will cease - "V'Etzrof ka'Bor Sigayich [v'Asirah Kol Bedilayich]";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If judges [of Yisrael that pervert the law] cease, oppressors of Yisrael will cease - "Hesir Hash-m Mishpatayich Pinah Oyvayech".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Mal'ai):</span> "Shovar Hash-m Mate Resha'im" - these are judges that became a staff [of support] for their clerks [to demand more for their duties than they are entitled to];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Shevet Moshlim" are Chachamim that defend crooked judgments of judges in their families.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> They are Chachamim that train unlearned people to be judges.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer ben Mal'ai):</span> "Ki Chapeichem Nego'alu va'Dam" - this refers to judges [who take bribes]; "V'Etzbe'oseichem be'Avon" are scribes [that write fraudulent documents]; "Sifsoseichem Dibru Sheker" are lawyers [that teach people which claims will win]; "Leshonchem Avlah Sehgeh" are the parties in the case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Mal'ai):</span> Yosef did not taste wine from the day he was sold [until his brothers came to Mitzrayim] - "Ul'Kadkod Nezir Echav";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Also his brothers did not drink [until then] - "Va'Yishtu va'Yishkeru <i>Imo</i>", implying that they did not drink in his absence.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Mil'ai says, they did not get drunk in his absence, but they drank.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Mal'ai):</span> Aharon's reward for "V'Ra'acha v'Somach b'Libo" (he truly delighted in Moshe's greatness) was to [be Kohen Gadol and] wear the Choshen Mishpat on his heart.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ANSWERS SENT TO THE <i>BENEI BASHKAR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>People of Bashkar sent to Levi to ask about Kilah [on Shabbos], hops in a vineyard, and a Mes on Yom Tov; Levi died before receiving the questions. Shmuel told Rav Menasiyah 'If you are a Chacham, answer them'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Menasiyah):</span> We investigated Kilah, and did not find any way to permit it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should have answered like Rami bar Yechezkeil taught (if it is on a string, one may extend it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Benei Bashkar are not Benei Torah (they are prone to extrapolate and permit more).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Menasiyah):</span> Hops in a vineyard are Kil'ayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should have answered like R. Tarfon!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Tarfon):</span> Hops in a vineyard are not Kil'ayim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, they are Kil'ayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>[Whenever there is an argument about an agricultural law in Eretz Yisrael,] in Chutz la'Aretz the Halachah follows the lenient opinion!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Benei Bashkar are not Benei Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav announced that one who wants to plant hops in a vineyard may do so;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav Amram Chasida lashed people who did so. (Tosfos - even though the Halachah follows R. Tarfon in Chutz la'Aretz, he needed to be stringent in his area, for they were not Benei Torah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rav Mesharshiya gave a Perutah to a Nochri child to plant them for him. (He holds that it is permitted, but it is better to distance oneself from doing so, lest others learn to be lenient.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he give a Perutah to a Yisrael child to do so?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was concerned lest the Yisrael continue to do so when he matures.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he give a Perutah to a Nochri adult?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He could be confused with a Yisrael [adult].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Menasiyah):</span> Neither Yisraelim nor Nochrim should be involved with [burial of] a Mes on Yom Tov, even on Yom Tov Sheni (the second day observed in Chutz la'Aretz).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rav Yehudah bar Shilas taught about a case in the synagogue of Ma'on of a Mes on Yom Tov that was before or after Shabbos (he did not remember which), and R. Yochanan permitted to bury it through Nochrim!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">139b----------------------------------------139b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a Mes could not be buried yesterday [or may not be buried tomorrow, e.g. on account of Shabbos], it may be buried through Nochrim on Yom Tov Rishon, and through Yisraelim on Yom Tov Sheni;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This applies even on the second day of Rosh Hashanah - but not regarding an egg [laid on the first day, it is forbidden on the second day, for both days of Rosh Hashanah are considered like one Kedushah in all other respects].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Benei Bashkar are not Benei Torah. (R. Tam - today, we are not Benei Torah.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SCHEMING TO AVOID RABBINIC PROHIBITIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin bar Rav Huna):</span> One may cloak himself in a Kilah and walk in Reshus ha'Rabim, without concern for the straps (which are for hanging it, they are not considered a load).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different than Rav Huna's law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If one walks in Reshus ha'Rabim on Shabbos with Tzitzis that do not fulfill the Mitzvah, he is Chayav Chatas (they are like a load)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [Even invalid] Tzitzis are important, they are not Batul to the garment - straps are Batul to the Kilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> (Chachamim forbid hanging a Meshameres only because this is a weekday act.) One may scheme and hang it in order to put pomegranates in it, and [later] strain wine through it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> He may strain only after using it for pomegranates.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different than the following?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may brew beer of dates or barley on Chol ha'Mo'ed for the sake of the festival, but not for after the festival.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even if one has old beer, he may brew and drink new beer [he brews <i>before</i> there is any indication that it is for the festival]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, nothing suggests that he brews b'Isur - here, a Meshameres is normally used for straining.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rabanan (to Rav Ashi):</span> Rav Huna bar Rav Chivan is a Chacham that schemes! He put a [clove of] garlic in a barrel of wine to seal the opening (Rashi - to stop the wine from coming out) - he said that he did so to store away the garlic (Rashi - this looks like he fixes the barrel; Rambam - it is like building onto a Kli);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, he went to sleep in a [Nochri's] ferry (knowing that the Nochri will cross the river) in order to guard his fruit on the other side - he said, I intended to sleep!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> He schemes about mid'Rabanan laws - he is a Chacham, he will not come to overtly transgress.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>STRAINING WINE ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On Shabbos, one may put water over dregs in order to make them clear, to allow the wine [inside them] to flow out;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may strain wine through a garment or a wicker basket, and put an egg in a mustard strainer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One may make Anomalin (a drink composed of wine, honey and peppers) on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah says, one may make Anomalin in a cup on Shabbos, in a flask [it is larger] on Yom Tov, and in a barrel on Chol ha'Mo'ed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Tzadok says, he may make according to the number of guests he has.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Ze'iri):</span> One may put clear wine or clear water in a Meshameres on Shabbos without concern, but not if they are cloudy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> One may mix up a barrel of wine with its dregs and pour it into a Meshameres on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ze'iri):</span> This applies when wine is being made in the winepress (people drink it with the dregs, so it is permitted to strain it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may strain wine through a garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Simi bar Chiya):</span> He may not make a depression in the garment (this is a weekday action; alternatively, he will come to squeeze).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Or a wicker basket.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Ashi):</span> The basket may not be a Tefach above the Kli [underneath that catches the wine, for then it makes an Ohel].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> It is permitted to stretch a garment across half the opening of a barrel to cover it (this is not an Ohel), but not over the entire opening.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> One may not stick straw and twigs into the mouth of a flask of wine, for this looks like a Meshameres.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>In Rav Papa's house they would gently pour beer from Kli to Kli, in order that the Pesoles remain at the bottom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> The last drops are separated from the Pesoles - this is like Borer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> Drops are not important in Rav Papa's house (he made and sold beer, he would discard the Pesoles with the remaining drops).</p>
