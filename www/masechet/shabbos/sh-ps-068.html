<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>GREAT GENERAL RULES OF SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (We discuss liability for Melachah on Shabbos b'Shogeg, i.e. he forgot that it is Shabbos, or that this Melachah is forbidden, or both of these.) There is a great general rule of Shabbos - anyone who forgot Shabbos entirely and did many Melachos on many Shabbosos is liable only one Korban;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he knew about Shabbos, and did many Melachos on many Shabbosos (each time he forgot that it is Shabbos), he is liable one Korban for every Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he remembered that the day is Shabbos, and did many Melachos on many Shabbosos (he forgot that these Melachos are forbidden), he is liable only one Korban for every Av Melachah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One who does many Melachos resembling one Melachah (they are Toldos (derivatives) of it) is liable only one Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why is this called a <i>great</i> general rule?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This is because another Mishnah (75B) teaches another general rule;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Likewise, in Maseches Shevi'is a general rule is called great for this reason.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> There are two general rules of Ma'aser, neither is called great (Tosfos ha'Rosh - even though one of them is more encompassing than the other)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yosi bar Avin):</span> Shabbos and Shevi'is both have Avos and Toldos, therefore the general rule is called great; Ma'aser does not have Avos and Toldos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Bar Kapara taught a great general rule regarding Ma'aser [in his version of Tosefta], even though it does not have Avos and Toldos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> [We say that a general rule is great if the Mitzvah is more stringent than another Mitzvah for which a general rule was taught.] The punishment for Shabbos is greater than that for Shevi'is - [the Isur Melachah of] Shabbos applies both to attached and detached [produce], but that of Shevi'is applies only to attached (Tosfos; Rashi - Shabbos applies both to what was attached or detached at the start of Shabbos, but [Kedushas] Shevi'is applies only to what was attached at the start of Shevi'is);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The punishment for Shevi'is is greater than that for Ma'aser - Shevi'is applies both to produce eaten by people and by animals, but Ma'aser applies only to produce eaten by people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>According to Bar Kapara, the punishment for Ma'aser is greater than that for Pe'ah - Ma'aser applies (most Meforshim - mid'Rabanan) to dates and vegetables, but Pe'ah does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Pe'ah must be left from any food with the following properties - people guard it, it grows from the ground, it is harvested at once, it may be stored for a long time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It says 'food' to exclude Sefichim (things that grew by themselves, e.g. from seeds which fell) of safflower or woad (a dye);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>'People guard it' excludes Hefker; 'it grows from the ground' excludes mushrooms and truffles; 'it is harvested at once' excludes figs; 'it may be stored for a long time' excludes vegetables.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Ma'aser must be taken from any food that grows from the ground and is guarded.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We do not require that it is harvested at once, or that it may be stored for a long time!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE WHO NEVER KNEW ABOUT SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav and Shmuel):</span> Our Mishnah discusses someone who [never learned about Shabbos, e.g.] a baby captured by Nochrim [and he grew up among them], or a convert who converted [in front of three Yisraelim, but continued to live] among Nochrim - but one who knew about Shabbos and forgot it is liable for every Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Anyone who forgot Shabbos entirely...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This implies that he once knew about Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it means that Shabbos was entirely forgotten from him (he never knew about it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This implies that one who once knew about Shabbos and later forgot is liable for every Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say 'If he knew about Shabbos, and did many Melachos on many Shabbosos, he is liable for each Shabbos' - it should teach 'This is if he never knew about Shabbos, but if he once knew about Shabbos and later forgot, he is liable for each', and all the more so if he did not forget!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, when it says 'If he knew about Shabbos [and did many Melachos..]', it means, he once knew about Shabbos and later forgot.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">68b----------------------------------------68b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he not forgotten, he would be liable for every Melachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, why does it say 'If he remembered that the day is Shabbos, and did many Melachos on many Shabbosos, he is liable once for every Av Melachah' - it should teach about one who knows about Shabbos [and forgot], all the more so this case!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Indeed, we must say that the Mishnah discusses one who knew about Shabbos and forgot, and the case of Rav and Shmuel has the same law as this;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav and Shmuel):</span> Even a baby captured by Nochrim or one who converted among Nochrim is like one who knew about Shabbos and forgot, he is liable. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish):</span> One who knew about Shabbos and forgot is liable - but a baby captured by Nochrim or one who converted among Nochrim is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> There is a great general rule of Shabbos - anyone who forgot Shabbos entirely and did many Melachos on many Shabbosos is liable only one Korban:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is, a baby was captured by Nochrim or a convert converted among Nochrim; he is also liable one Korban for eating blood, and one for Chelev, and one for idolatry [and for every other Chiyuv Chatas he transgressed].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Munvaz exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Munvaz:</span> [Regarding Shevu'as ha'Edus, one who transgresses] b'Mezid is called Chotei, just like Shogeg - just like Mezid knew [that he sinned], also Shogeg [is liable only if he once] knew.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> If so, you should say that just like Mezid knew at the time he sinned, also Shogeg who knows at the time he sins [is liable]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Munvaz:</span> Answer: Indeed, I say this! (This will be explained.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> If so, he is Mezid, not Shogeg!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> The Beraisa says that a baby captured by Nochrim is liable - this is like Rav and Shmuel, it opposes R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish hold like Munvaz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Munvaz' reason? (Rashi - why does he exempt one who never knew - he cannot simply learn Shogeg from Mezid, they are opposites! Ramban - why does he obligate one who knew at the time he sinned?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> After "Torah Achas Yihyeh Lachem la'Oseh bi'Shgagah" it says "Veha'Nefesh Asher Ta'aseh b'Yad Ramah" - this equates Shogeg to Mezid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like Mezid knew, also Shogeg [is liable only if he] knew (Rashi; Ramban - just like Mezid knew, also Shogeg [is liable even though he] knew).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim expound "Torah Achas..."?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They expound like R. Yehoshua ben Levi taught to his son:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua be Levi):</span> It says "Torah Achas Yihyeh Lachem la'Oseh bi'Shgagah" - this refers to idolatry, whose severity is like "...Kol ha'Mitzvos";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Right after "Torah Achas..." it says "Veha'Nefesh Asher Ta'aseh b'Yad Ramah" - this equates the entire Torah to idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like idolatry is punishable by Kares b'Mezid and one brings a Chatas b'Shogeg, Chatas is brought for all such Mitzvos (transgressed through action).</p>
