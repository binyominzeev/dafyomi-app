<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yehudah permits goats to go wrapped to be dry (not to produce milk), not for milk (wrapped loosely, so it will not inhibit milk or in order to catch drops; alternatively - to prevent dripping).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Chiya bar Yosef told Rav's opinion to Shmuel.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Binyamin's teaching concluded'But not a basket' [unlike Rav].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> All agree that a Marda'as is permitted - why is it different from an Ukaf (one may not even remove it)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> An Ukaf can fall by itself (therefore, we need not permit removing it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> One may put on a Marda'as for warmth, to alleviate pain - removing an Ukaf is to cool the donkey, this is merely a matter of comfort;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa forbids a Kemi'a that is not Mumcheh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says, even though it is Mumcheh!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No - people have Mazel (Rashi - angels that advocate for them; Me'iri - a person's confidence that the Kemi'a will work helps to cure him) - perhaps the Kemi'a will not help animals, which lack this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa calls this a stringency of animals over people - if an animal may go out with a Kemi'a Mumcheh for animals, animals are not more stringent than people! (Maharsha - the Gemara must know that Mumcheh for animals is not Mumcheh for people (Me'iri - this is because animals are very physical) - if not, it is harder to be Mumcheh for animals, this is a stringency of animals!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, 'This is a stringency of animals over people' does not refer to a Kemi'a, rather, to going out with a sandal (if it would fall off an animal, one might carry it; if a person's sandal fell off, he would not carry it, he would put it on again)!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It looks like he enters the water to cool off [not for the sake of a cure].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should be permitted for an animal for the same reason!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People normally do so to cool off, animals do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do not decree against curing animals!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If an animal was standing outside the Techum (outskirts of the city, the furthest that one may go on Shabbos), one may call for it to come - we do not decree lest he leave the Techum to bring it (people are not frantic about animals - similarly, he may cure an animal, he will not come to grind spices)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> [We decree against curing animals -] the case is, the animal was within the Techum of its owner, it was outside its Techum (it receives the Techum of its shepherd).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not one may cure animals:</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R.

Ri - Answer #3 also forbids 'for milk' because it is loose, it might fall - but Rav Yehudah did not cite this Beraisa, he did not 'limit' the Beraisos to R. Yehudah.
