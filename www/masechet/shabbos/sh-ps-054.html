<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The tail is tied down to prevent mating.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Kevulos denotes something that does not bear fruit?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Mah he'Arim?Eretz <i>Kavul</i>".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> It was full of people adorned with gold and silver.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If so, why was Chiram unhappy with them - "V'Lo Yoshru b'Einav"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> Because they were rich and delicate, they did not work.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The land was sandy (alternatively - salty and cleaved).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was it called Kavul?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One who walks in it sinks in until the Kavla (Rashi - ankle; Tosfos - thigh); this is like people say, a Mekavla land that does not bear fruit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They may go out Kevunos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The wool is guarded [from birth to be utterly clean] for Milas (quality wool).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [The appearance of Tzara'as called] Ses is like white wool.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is white wool?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Bivi bar Abaye):</span> It is wool of a newborn lamb that is guarded for Milas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Goats may go out wrapped.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah (he permits wrapped to be dry, not for milk);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi (he forbids both of these).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav):</span> Goats may go out wrapped to be dry, not for milk;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Both of these are forbidden. (Tosfos - in this version, they did not cite the Halachah in the name of the Tana'im, because there was dispute about which Tana said what.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Goats may go out wrapped to be dry, not for milk;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah ben Beseira says, [letter of the law] this is the Halachah - however, onlookers cannot tell the intent! Therefore, both of these are forbidden. (Tosfos - in a place where they are wrapped only to be dry, this is permitted.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah ben Beseira.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> The Halachah follows the first Tana (Tosfos - of the Beraisa; Rashi of our Mishnah).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TAKING AN ANIMAL OUT WITH ITS LIMBS TIED TOGETHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It is forbidden for animals to go out in the following ways:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A camel may not go out with Metulteles (a strap or pillow under the tail to stop a load from slipping; alternatively, a Marda'as), nor Akud nor Ragul (with limbs tied - these will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The same applies to all animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may not tie camels one to another and lead them;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One may lead several camels at once, holding the ropes in his hand, on condition that he does not wind the ropes (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> A camel may not go out with a Metulteles tied to the tail, but it may go out with a Metulteles tied to the tail and hump.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> A camel may go out with a Metulteles tied to its bottom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It may not go out Akud nor Ragul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Akud is when the hand (foreleg) and [hind] leg are tied together, like Akeidas Yitzchak (Medrash Tanchuma);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ragul is when the hand is bent and tied [so it cannot be extended].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1):</span> Akud is when both hands or both feet are tied together; Ragul is when the hand is bent and tied.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav Yehudah holds like the following Tana:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> Akud is when the hand and leg are tied together, or both hands or both feet; Ragul is when the hand is bent and tied.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Tana agrees with what Rav Yehudah calls Akud and Ragul, but he says that both hands or both feet tied together is also Akud, unlike Rav Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, Rav Yehudah holds like the following Tana:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #3):</span> Akud is when the hand and leg are tied together; Ragul is when the hand is bent and tied.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not tie camels one to the other and lead them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> It looks like he takes them to sell them in the market.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOLDING THE ROPES OF AN ANIMAL ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may hold the ropes in his hand [but may not wind them].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> It is forbidden to wrap them on account of Kil'ayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Isur of Kil'ayim does he refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He refers to different species working together (he and the camels pull the ropes; alternatively, he and the camels pull a wagon, e.g. on a weekday).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> A person may plow or pull with any animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He refers to Sha'atnez (some ropes are of wool, others are of linen).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Beraisa):</span> If wool and linen were connected through one stitch or knot, they are not considered connected regarding Kilayim (all the more so, ropes wound in the hand that are not tied)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, he refers to Sha'atnez - the Mishnah means, one may not wind them and tie them [twice].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One may not leave a Tefach of the ropes sticking out of his hand [away from the animals, for it looks like he carries something other than the reins].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Tana d'vei Shmuel):</span> Two Tefachim may not stick out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Resolution (Abaye):</span> Letter of the law, up to two Tefachim may stick out - however, we tell people that only one Tefach may stick out.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">54b----------------------------------------54b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One may not let the rope hang within a Tefach of the ground [but we are not concerned if much sticks out of his hand]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to the rope between him and the camel.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THINGS ANIMALS MAY NOT GO OUT WITH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A donkey may not go out with the following (most of them will be explained):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Marda'as if it is not tied; a bell, even if the clapper is plugged; a 'ladder' on its neck; a strap between its legs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A chicken may not go out with strings or ribbons on its legs;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A ram may not go out with a wagon under its tail; female sheep may not go out Chanunos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A calf may not go out with Gimon; a cow may not go out with porcupine skin, nor with a strap between its horns;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The cow of R. Elazar ben Azaryah used to go out with a strap between its horns - Chachamim disapproved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why is Marda'as forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Rashi) Answer:</span> This is like we explained (since it was not tied from before Shabbos, it is not considered clothing).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> We are concerned lest it fall, and the owner will carry it in Reshus ha'Rabim. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Nor with a bell, even if the clapper is plugged.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>This is because it looks like he takes it to sell it in the market.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ?Nor with a 'ladder' on its neck. (Rashi - from now on, everything is forbidden lest it fall, and the owner will carry it; Me'iri - some say that they are considered loads.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> This is tied to the jaw, to stop a donkey with a wound from scratching it with its teeth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Nor with a strap between its legs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>This is to prevent it from knocking its knees while it walks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A chicken may not go out with strings [on its legs].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>The string shows who owns the chicken.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ?Nor with straps on its legs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>This is to prevent it from breaking vessels.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A ram may not go out with a wagon under its tail.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>This is to prevent the tail from getting wounded on the ground.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Female sheep may not go out Chanunos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Explanation #1 (Rav Acha bar Ula):</span> When they shear a sheep, they soak a tuft in oil and put it on the forehead so it will not be cold [until it grows more wool].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Chisda):</span> It is proper to show such concern for Mar Ukva (the Av Beis Din), but not for a sheep!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Explanation #2 (Rav Papa bar Shmuel):</span> When a sheep gives birth, they put tufts soaked in oil on its forehead and womb to warm it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman):</span> It is proper to show such concern for Yalsa (my wife, the Nasi's daughter), but not for a sheep!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Explanation #3 (Rav Huna):</span> This is a wood called Chanun found on islands - one puts a chip in its nostril to make it sneeze and expel worms from its head.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, this should also be done for males!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Males batter each other, this causes worms to fall out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Shimon Nezira:</span> A chip of Risma (Rosem, a wood that makes hot coals - 37B) is used.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Huna, we understand why this is called Chanunos - how do the other opinions explain this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a merciful thing to do (like Chanun).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A calf may not go out with Gimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> This is Bar Nira (a small yoke to accustom the calf to bend its head, so it will be prepared to bear a proper yoke when it matures).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> He learns that Gimon connotes bending from "Ha'Lachof k'Agmon Rosho".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A cow may not go out with porcupine skin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>This is put [over the udder] so that porcupines (Tosfos; Rashi - leeches) will not suckle.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>Rav forbids this whether it is for Noy or for Shemirah; Shmuel forbids if it is for Noy, and permits if it is for Shemirah.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> It was his neighbor's cow - since he did not protest, it was attributed to him.</p>
