<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHY THE <i>EIRUVIN</i> FORBID CARRYING IN THE <i>MAVUY</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chanina Chuza'ah):</span> If houses made Eiruvei Chatzeros with the Chatzeros, one may carry only within four Amos - presumably, this is because each Chatzer is like a house;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Rav taught elsewhere, that a Lechi or Korah permits a Mavuy only if houses <i>and</i> Chatzeros are open to the Mavuy - it is as if there are only houses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also when the houses did not make Eiruvei Chatzeros with the Chatzeros it should be forbidden - since one may not transfer from the houses to the Chatzeros, it is as if the houses are sealed, and only Chatzeros open to the Mavuy!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> All the houses in each Chatzer can Mevatel (pardon) their share in the Chatzer to one house, permitting that house to transfer to the Chatzer (it is as if the Chatzer belongs exclusively to that house).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, it is as if there is only one house in each Chatzer (Rav requires house<i>s</i> and Chatzeros open to the Mavuy)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They can Mevatel their share in the Chatzer to one house in the morning, and to a different house in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Still, at any time it is as if there is only one house in each Chatzer (Rav requires house<i>s</i> and Chatzeros open to the Mavuy)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> (Rav holds like R. Shimon, who permits transferring from one Chatzer to another -) the only reason to forbid transferring from Chatzeros to the Mavuy is the houses, if the houses cannot transfer to the Chatzeros it is as if there are no houses.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>MACHSHIRIM</i> THAT OVERRIDE SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> R. Eliezer does not say that all Machshirei (preparations for) Mitzvos override Shabbos - Shtei ha'Lechem must be brought on Shavu'os, yet R. Eliezer needed a Gezerah Shavah to permit baking them on Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer) Question:</span> What is the source that Machshirei Shtei ha'Lechem override Shabbos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says 'Hava'ah' (bringing) regarding both the Omer and Shtei ha'Lechem - just like Machshirei ha'Omer override Shabbos, also Machshirei Shtei ha'Lechem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We must say that the Gezerah Shavah is Mufneh (the word(s) we learn from are extra, we do not challenge such a Gezerah Shavah) - if not, we could challenge it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Machshirei ha'Omer override Shabbos, because [it must be harvested on Motzei Pesach Lishmah,] one cannot use barley that was already cut - but we can use wheat that was already cut for Shtei ha'Lechem!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Affirmation:</span> Yes, it is Mufneh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Va'Haveisem Es Omer Reishis Ketzirchem El ha'Kohen" - why do we also need "Mi'Yom Havi'achem"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is extra, for the Gezerah Shavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This shows that it is Mufneh from one side (one of the words we learn from is extra) - R. Eliezer holds that we learn from such a Gezerah Shavah only if there is no challenge against it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (It is Mufneh from both sides -) "Tavi'u" is extra (it already says "V'Hikravtem Lechem Tenufah").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [R. Chiya bar Aba taught that R. Eliezer does not say that all Machshirei Mitzvos override Shabbos -] what does he exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He excludes Lulav (we explain below what Melachah is needed for this and the following Mitzvos).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Lulav and all its Machshirim override Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He excludes Sukah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Sukah and all its Machshirim override Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He excludes Matzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Matzah and all its Machshirim override Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He excludes Shofar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Shofar and all its Machshirim override Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> He excludes Tzitzis for one's garment and Mezuzah for one's doorway.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> All agree that if one put Tzitzis on his garment or fixed a Mezuzah in his doorway he is Chayav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> There is no fixed time for these Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection: (Abaye):</span> Just the contrary! Since there is no fixed time for them, they apply at all times!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">131b----------------------------------------131b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> It is because he could make his garment or house Hefker (therefore, the Mitzvah is not obligatory, it does not override Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Lulav and all its Machshirim override Shabbos.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Those are Tzorech Gavoha (needed for Avodas ha'Mikdash, we cannot learn to regular Mitzvos)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Ba'Yom" - even on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this permit?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It permits Tiltul (moving it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We do not need a verse to permit Tiltul (Muktzeh is forbidden only mid'Rabanan)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It permits Machshirav (cutting it off a tree).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim (who forbid Machshirav) expound "Ba'Yom" - not at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Eliezer learn this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "U'Smachtem...Shiv'as Yomim" - days, not nights.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Chachamim say, we also need "Ba'Yom" otherwise we would have learned a Gezerah Shavah "Shiv'as Yomim-Shiv'as Yomim" from Sukah, which applies even at night!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Why are other verses needed to teach that Machshirei Omer and Shtei ha'Lechem override Shabbos -) we should learn them from Lulav!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We could not learn from Lulav, for it must be taken with three other species.</p>
