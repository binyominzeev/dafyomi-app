<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [She may tie] straps of her cloak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious (she unties it every day)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, there is one strap above and one below - it suffices to untie one to remove her cloak;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that we are concerned lest she Mevatel one (permanently leave it tied) - the Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ...Threads of her hairnet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious (she unties it every day)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it is tied loosely, she need not untie it to remove it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that we are concerned lest she permanently leave it tied - the Mishnah teaches, she would not do so, for she does not want to uproot hairs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [One may tie] laces of shoes and sandals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If one untied laces of shoes or sandals he is Chayav Chatas;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> He is exempt, but it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #3):</span> It is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>There are contradictions regarding shoes and sandals!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Resolution - part 1 (regarding shoes):</span> Shoemakers tie the lace onto the shoe permanently, one is liable for this (we need not specify tying or untying, the law of both is the same);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One is exempt for tying like Rabanan, but it is forbidden (it is not so tight, i.e. one can remove the shoe without untying it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is permitted to tie like people of Mechuza (a city - it is very tight, and one must untie it each night to remove the shoe).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Resolution - part 2 (regarding sandals):</span> Shoemakers permanently tie the strap onto the sandal of Yishmaeli merchants - one is liable for this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Other people tie the strap on by themselves (it is not permanent, but it can be left for a while) - one is exempt for this, but it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In a sandal used by two people, like Rav Yehudah's, it is permitted (each must retie it to fit his foot, it is untied every day).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Rav Yehudah the brother of Rav Sala Chasida had one pair of sandals - sometimes he would go out with it, sometimes his son would. On Shabbos, he asked Abaye if he may tie it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> One is Chayav Chatas for this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> I did not understand why it is forbidden [l'Chatchilah] - can you say that one is liable for it?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Why should it be permitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> Even during the week, sometimes I go out with it, sometimes my son does.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> If so, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A SANDAL WITH A BROKEN STRAP</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Yirmiyah was walking in a Karmelis, the strap of his sandal snapped; he asked R. Avahu what to do.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Avahu:</span> Take a moist reed which an animal could eat, and tie it on [in place of the strap].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>(A sandal has an Ozen (flap) and Tarsis (a place in which the straps are fixed) on each side.) The [outer] Tarsis of Abaye's sandal snapped [in the Chatzer]; he asked Rav Yosef what to do.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Leave it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Why is this different than the case of R. Yirmiyah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> There, the sandal was in an unguarded place - yours is in a guarded place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Why can't I move it? It is a Kli, I could wear it on the other foot! (It is shameful to wear it when the outer strap is broken, but if worn on the other foot, the broken strap would be on the inside and not noticeable!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Since R. Yochanan answered according to R. Yehudah, this shows that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If the two Oznayim or two Tarsiyos of a sandal snapped; or if the entire sole came off, it is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If one Ozen or Tarsis snapped, or if most of the sole came off, it is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yehudah says, if an inner Ozen or Tarsis snapped it is Tamei, if an outer one snapped it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> They argue about Shabbos [when the outer strap snapped] just like they argue about Tum'ah, but not regarding Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yochanan hold regarding Chalitzah (which Tana agrees to the other)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He holds that Chachamim consider it a Kli for Shabbos, just like for Tum'ah, but not regarding Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> If Chalitzah was done on the right foot with a left shoe, it is Kosher. (If the outer Ozen of a left sandal snapped, it is still a Kli because he can wear it reversed on the right foot, then the inner Ozen will be broken - all consider this a proper sandal, surely it is valid for Chalitzah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He holds that R. Yehudah does not consider it a Kli for Shabbos, just like it is not a Kli for Tum'ah, but it is a Kli for Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chalitzah on the right foot with a left shoe is Kosher when it is a proper left shoe - here, R. Yehudah says that it is not a proper left shoe (he is Metaher)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, R. Yochanan said...'And similarly regarding Chalitzah';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He teaches that Chalitzah with a left shoe is Kosher only when it is a proper left shoe. (This must be like R. Yehudah - it is no Chidush according to Chachamim, it is a proper sandal in any case,)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">112b----------------------------------------112b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This shows that R. Yochanan rules like R. Yehudah - but R. Yochanan said that the Halachah follows a Stam (anonymous) Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an Ozen of a [Tamei Medras] sandal snapped and was fixed; it is Tamei Medras.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is even if the outer Ozen snapped!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is only if the inner Ozen snapped.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If the outer Ozen snapped, it is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does the Seifa teach that if the other Ozen snapped and was fixed; it is Tahor from Medras but Tamei like Maga (something that touched a) Medras - the distinction is not whether one or two snapped, rather, if it was the right or left Ozen!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> We establish the Mishnah to discuss a sandal with four Oznayim and four Tarsiyos, to avoid a contradiction in the words of R. Yochanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> Rav rules like R. Yehudah, R. Yochanan does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Yochanan answered according to R. Yehudah - surely he holds that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Amora'im argue about the opinion of R. Yochanan.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PANIM CHODOSHIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a (wooden) Kli of a Ba'al ha'Bayis (i.e. not a craftsman) has a hole k'Rimon (the size of a pomegranate), it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Chizkiyah):</span> If a Kli had a hole the size of k'Zayis, and it was sealed, then got another hole the size of k'Zayis, and it was sealed, and so on, until the total size of the holes was k'Rimon, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> [We can learn from what] you taught us about a sandal!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> If (a sandal became Tamei Medras (an Av ha'Tumah) through a Zav or Nidah), and one Ozen snapped and it was fixed, it is [still] Tamei Medras (this is true even if it was not fixed - we say that it was fixed on account of the next clause);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the other Ozen snapped and it was fixed, it is not Tamei Medras, it only (a Rishon), like something that touched a Medras.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When the first Ozen snapped, it did not lose Tum'as Medras, because the second strap was intact - likewise, when the second Ozen snaps, it should not lose Tum'as Medras on account of the other intact (replaced) strap!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Chizkiyah):</span> There are Panim Chodoshim (enough of the sandal (that received Tum'ah) is missing to Metaher, therefore, even when it is fixed the initial Tum'ah does not return) - the same applies to your question!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Chizkiyah):</span> You are not human (your Chachmah is angelic)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Chizkiyah):</span> You are an [ideal] person!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> If the early Chachamim were like sons of angels, we are like people; if they were like people, we are like donkeys;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I do not refer to the donkeys of R. Chanina ben Dosa or R. Pinchas ben Ya'ir [they could tell if food was Tevel, and would not eat it], rather, to regular donkeys.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>OTHER PERMITTED KNOTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [One may tie] drawstrings of pouches of wine and oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious (one unties it for every use)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the pouch has two openings from which one can pour - one might have thought that we are concerned lest he permanently leave one tied - the Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [A garment] around a pot of meat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the pot has a spout - one might have thought that we are concerned lest he permanently leave the opening covered [and always remove through the spout] - the Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> One may tie [in front of an animal].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious (one unties it to let it out)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer:</span> The case is, the rope is tied on both sides of the opening - one might have thought that we are concerned lest he will permanently leave one end tied - the Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer:</span> The case is, there are two ropes, one above the other - one might have thought that we are concerned lest he will permanently leave the top rope tied (the animal can crouch under it) - the Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The Halachah follows R. Eliezer ben Yakov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> This implies that Chachamim argue with him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> What difference does it make (either way, the Halachah follows him)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Should we say teachings like a song [for which there is no need]?!</p>
