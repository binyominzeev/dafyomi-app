<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 4:c, 28B - Rava):</span> R. Eliezer forbids lighting with a wick or rag that is not singed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Yosef heard that a Mishnah discusses exactly three by three - how can we explain this (according to Rava, the size does not matter!)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches about Tum'ah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> A garment must be three [fingers] by three to Mekabel Tum'ah - this excludes the Malal (a hem around the perimeter).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, [it suffices if there was] exactly three by three [at the beginning, even though there will be less after the hem is made].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> R. Yehudah permits lighting with a Kli, but not with a Kli that broke [on Yom Tov];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon permits [in either case].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yehudah permits lighting with dates (since they are fit to eat, one may move them for other purposes), but not with pits of dates [eaten on Yom Tov, since they are Nolad];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon permits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yehudah permits lighting with nuts, but not with shells of nuts [eaten on Yom Tov];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon permits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>We must teach the argument in all three cases:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had we only taught the first, one might have thought that there R. Yehudah considers it Nolad for it was a Kli and now it is a broken Kli - but he would not forbid the pits, for they did not change;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had we only taught the second, one might have thought that there R. Yehudah considers it Nolad for the pits were hidden and now they are exposed - but he would not forbid shells, which were exposed from the beginning</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Therefore, we also need to teach the third.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav did not say this explicitly, rather it was inferred from the following episode:</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav was eating dates and throwing the pits into an oven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> It would be forbidden to do so on Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did Rav agree to this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When Rav came to Bavel, he ate dates [on Yom Tov] and threw the pits to animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He was eating good, ripe dates (nothing remains on the pit - even though they are no longer fit for people, Rav would move them -) this shows that he did not accept R. Chiya's words!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, they were poor dates (some fruit remains on the pit, they are still fit for people).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shmuel bar bar Chanah):</span> According to R. Yehudah, who permits lighting with a Kli, but not with a broken Kli, once one starts to light it, it is a broken Kli, he moves Isur!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> He does like Rav Masnah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Masnah):</span> If wood fell from a date tree into an oven on Yom Tov, one may add to it a larger amount of [permitted] wood ready from before Yom Tov (to Mevatel the Nolad) and light all of it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Hamnuna):</span> The case is, the wick was a lowly rag less than three by three [Tefachim, from the beginning it was not considered a Kli];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer and R. Akiva are consistent with what they taught elsewhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If a garment less than three by three [Tefachim] was designated to plug up [an opening through which water enters] a bathhouse or to be a potholder, or to clean out a grinder, whether or not it is prepared (this will be explained), it is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehoshua says, in either case it is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Akiva says, if it is prepared, it is Tamei, if not, it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> All agree that if the owner threw it in the wasteheap, it is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">29b----------------------------------------29b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>All agree that if he left it in a box, it is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>They argue about when he hung on a peg or left it in back of the door:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Eliezer holds, since he did not throw it in the wasteheap, this shows that he cares about it - it is called unprepared in relation to something left in a box;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yehoshua holds, since he did not leave it in a box, this shows that he was Mevatel it - it is called prepared in relation to something thrown in the wasteheap;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>R. Akiva holds like R. Eliezer when he hung it on a peg, he holds like R. Yehoshua when he left it in back of the door.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>Later, R. Akiva adopted R. Yehoshua's opinion in both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava) Question:</span> Why does it say Pesilas ha'Beged (wick of garment, a construct form) instead of Pesilas Shel Beged (a wick [made] of garment)?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that it is still a garment.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LEAVING OIL TO DRIP INTO A LAMP</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not puncture an eggshell and fill it with oil and put it on top of a lamp in order that the oil will drip into the lamp [on Shabbos];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>It is forbidden even to leave oil dripping from a Kli Cheres;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah permits [both of these].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If the potter made it like this from the beginning, it is permitted, for it is one Kli.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>One may not fill a bowl [next to a lamp] with oil and insert a wick to draw oil;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yehudah permits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> The argument must be taught in all three cases:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they argued only about an eggshell, one might have thought that Chachamim forbid this because one might take from it [for consumption], but they permit from a Kli Cheres because it is repulsive, one is not likely to take oil from it; (Rashi - since the oil was designated to burn, one who takes it is liable for extinguishing; Tosfos (42B) - one is liable for extinguishing only if he takes from the oil in the Ner itself, taking oil dripping into it only <i>causes</i> it to extinguish sooner, it is forbidden on account of Muktzeh</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they argued only about a Kli Cheres, one might have thought that R. Yehudah permits because one is not likely to take from it, but he would forbid from an eggshell.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the potter made it like this from the beginning, it is permitted...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If [anyone] joined them with plaster or clay, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah permits only if the potter joined it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, it is permitted only if it was joined [very well,] like a potter would do.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Once we spent Shabbos in Beis Nitzeh in Lud, they brought to us an eggshell; we filled it with oil, punctured it and put it on top of a lamp; R. Tarfon and Chachamim were there, they did not say anything.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> In Beis Nitzeh they are zealous, but in other places it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE WHO DOES NOT INTEND TO TRANSGRESS SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Avin of Tzipori dragged a bench on a stone floor of an Aliyah (upper story) in front of R. Yitzchak ben Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yitzchak:</span> If I will be quiet, like the Chachamim who saw R. Yehudah use the eggshell,  disaster will result (people will think that it is permitted)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is forbidden - we decree about a stone floor of an Aliyah on account of a regular Aliyah [with a dirt floor, it could make a furrow].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The overseer of the synagogue in Botzrah dragged a bench on a stone floor in front of R. Yirmeyah the elder.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yirmeyah:</span> You do this for you hold like R. Shimon? R. Shimon permits only big benches, which one cannot carry - he forbids dragging a small bench, for one can carry it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yirmeyah argues with Ula:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> They (R. Shimon and R. Yehudah) argue about small benches (and R. Shimon permits), but all permit a big bench!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (against R. Yirmeyah and Ula - Rav Yosef - Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> One may drag a bed, chair or bench, as long as he does not intend to make a furrow;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(In the Seifa, R. Yehudah forbids everything except for a wagon, for it does not make a furrow.) This shows that they argue about big and small Kelim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (for Ula):</span> The bed discussed is small, just like a chair [which is taught with it].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (for R. Yirmeyah):</span> The chair discussed is big, just like a bed [which is taught with it].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (against R. Yirmeyah - Rabah - Mishnah):</span> One who sells garments [with Sha'atnez] may sell normally [he wears it to display it], as long as he does not intend that it will protect him from the sun or rain [or cold, and it is possible that he would be protected without the Sha'atnez, i.e. he also wears other garments].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tzenu'im (who are careful to avoid suspicion) hang such garments on a stick in back of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is like a small bench, for one could do like Tzenu'im to avoid benefit - still, R. Shimon permits!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yirmeyah is refuted.</p>
