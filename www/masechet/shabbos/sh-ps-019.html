<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN ARE WE CONCERNED FOR WHAT NOCHRIM DO ON SHABBOS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may put food in front of his dog (which he is obligated to feed) in the Chatzer; if the dog takes it out, we are not concerned;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Similarly, one may put food in front of a Nochri in the Chatzer; if he takes it out, we are not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need the Seifa, it is just like the Reisha?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that it is permitted only regarding his dog, for he is obligated to feed it - the Seifa teaches, this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not rent vessels to a Nochri on Erev Shabbos (Rashi - it looks like he rents them to do Melachah on Shabbos; Tosfos - it looks like he receives rental for Shabbos, even though he rents for a whole week or month); on Wednesday or Thursday, it is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Similarly, one may not send letters with a Nochri on Erev Shabbos; on Wednesday or Thursday, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Nothing written by R. Yosi ha'Kohen (some say, R. Yosi ha'Chasid) was ever given to a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not send letters with a Nochri on Erev Shabbos unless they agreed on the price (for then, the Nochri works on his own behalf);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Beis Shamai permit only if he can reach the destination before Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Beis Hillel permit if he can reach the first house in the city of the receiver.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since they agreed on the price, Beis Hillel should permit in any case!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> It means, if they did not agree on the price, Beis Shamai permit only if he can reach the destination, Beis Hillel permit if he can reach the first house in the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Reisha forbids [unless they agreed on the price]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi, according to Ritva) Answer:</span> The Seifa is when the recipient is always at home, in the Reisha he is not (if the Nochri does not find the receiver, he will have to look for him on Shabbos. The Gemara calls the recipient 'Do'ar' (mayor), for most letters are sent to him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rif) Answer:</span> The Seifa is when there is a fixed Do'ar (postmaster) in the recipient's city (the Nochri gives it to the Do'ar, who delivers it to the recipient), in the Reisha there is not a Do'ar. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THINGS FORBIDDEN CLOSE TO SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not embark on a ship less than three days before Shabbos. (Tosfos - this is on account of the Isur to swim on Shabbos (Beitzah 36B); R. Chananel - the case is, the water is less than 10 Tefachim deep, it is forbidden on account of Techum Shabbos; Rif - we are concerned that he will get seasick, and not enjoy Shabbos; Ba'al ha'Ma'or - we are concerned that danger will arise necessitating him to do Melachah. Before three days, he need not be concerned for the coming Shabbos)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This refers to a voyage of Reshus, but it is permitted if he goes for a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rebbi says, he must stipulate with the captain that they will not travel on Shabbos - [later,] we are not concerned if they actually do travel on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, he need not stipulate.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is permitted to go from Tzor to Tzidon even on Erev Shabbos (the voyage takes only one day).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may not begin a siege around a Nochri city less than three days before Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If we began within three days, we do not stop.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Shamai expounded "Ad Ridtah" - (we may conquer a city) even on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> My father's house used to give white garments to a Nochri launderer three days before Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Tzadok):</span> R. Gamliel's house used to give white garments to a Nochri launderer three days before Shabbos, and colored garment even on Erev Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>This teaches that it is harder to launder white garments than colored garments.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Abaye gave a colored garment to a launderer, who wanted to charge the same as for a white garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Chachamim taught that it is harder to launder white garments!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> When you give a garment to a launderer, it is wise to measure it beforehand and when taking it back:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it got longer, the launderer is at fault for stretching it; if it got shorter, the he is at fault for shrinking it (by using water that is too hot).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>JUICE THAT COMES OUT ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai agree that one may put beams [on top of olives or grapes...]</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Beis Shamai decree about everything else, but not this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the other cases, if one would do so on Shabbos he would be liable, Beis Shamai decree just before Shabbos; here, if one would put on the beams on Shabbos he would be exempt, they do not decree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is our Tana, who permits whatever comes by itself (e.g. the juice that flows from the grapes and olives)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> It is R. Yishmael:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yishmael):</span> If one crushed garlic, Boser (unripe grapes) or Melilos (unripe grain), (and placed stones on them to squeeze out the juice), he may allow it to continue on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva forbids;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Elazar):</span> It is [the Tana] R. Elazar:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If cakes of honey were crushed before Shabbos and the honey flowed out on Shabbos, it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Elazar permits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina answer like R. Elazar?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn from there, for the honey was a [solid] food from the beginning - here, we permit even a liquid squeezed from a solid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> We know that R. Elazar permits even juice that exudes from grapes and olives!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Hoshaya - Beraisa):</span> If one crushed grapes or olives before Shabbos and juice flowed out by itself on Shabbos, it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Elazar and R. Shimon permit it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina had not heard this Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't R. Elazar answer like R. Yosi?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan taught [regarding R. Yosi's Beraisa] that R. Yishmael and R. Akiva agree that if the garlic, Boser or Melilos were not crushed, what exudes is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about they were crushed, they only need to be squeezed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In our Mishnah, the grapes and olives need to be crushed more!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina ruled like R. Yishmael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Shemen of Badadim (Tosfos - oil that exudes on Shabbos; Rashi - oil left in the corners if the olivepress, it is given to the one who makes the oil) and mats used to cover the olives are forbidden (they are Muktzeh or Nolad) on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> They are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Double-mats used to cover merchandise are forbidden (Muktzeh) on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> They are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Rav forbids the following, Shmuel permits them:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A goat [raised] for [the sake of] milk, a sheep for wool, a hen for eggs, oxen for plowing, and dates one intends to sell.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav holds like R. Yehudah [who is stringent about Muktzeh], Shmuel holds like R. Shimon [who permits almost all categories of Muktzeh].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>A certain Talmid in the city of Charta ruled like R. Shimon; Rav Hamnuna excommunicated him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Halachah follows R. Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Charta is in Rav's region, one should not rule against Rav there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span>There were two Talmidim, one saved [food and drink] from a fire in one vessel, the other saved in four or five vessels;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue like Rabah bar Zavda and Rav Huna argue (120A).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>MELACHOS</i> THAT MUST BEGIN BEFORE SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not leave meat, onions or eggs to roast unless there is time for them to get roasted before Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may not put bread in an oven just before Shabbos or a cake on top of coals unless there is time for the faces to form a crust before Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Eliezer requires time for the bottom face to form a crust.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>We may lower the Korban Pesach into an oven just before Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>It suffices to make the bonfire in the Beis ha'Mokad (a chamber in the Mikdash) to catch a little [before Shabbos];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Outside the Mikdash, most of the wood must catch fire [before Shabbos, lest one will stoke it on Shabbos to help the fire catch];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Yehudah says, if coals are used, any amount may catch beforehand (they do not need to be stoked).</p>
