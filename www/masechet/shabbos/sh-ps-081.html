<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur for a bone is to make a spoon;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, it is to make a lock.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Shi'ur for glass is to scrape the end of the spindle;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Shi'ur for a pebble or stone is to throw at a bird [to chase it away];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, it is to throw at an animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> R. Yehudah's Shi'ur is bigger than Chachamim's - elsewhere, Chachamim's Shi'ur is bigger!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> R. Yehudah means, to make teeth of a lock (big protrusions corresponding to small protrusions on the key, and vice-versa. It is less than Chachamim's Shi'ur).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Teeth (Rashi - of bone; Tosfos - of metal) of a lock are Tehorim; if they were fixed in a lock, they are Mekabel Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Teeth of a door lock are Tehorim even if they were nailed in, for anything attached to the ground is like the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur for glass is to scrape...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Shi'ur for glass is to cut two threads at once (this is the same as to scrape the end of the weaving rod).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur for a pebble or stone is to throw at a bird; R. Eliezer ben Yakov [says, to throw at an animal].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It must be big enough so that the bird or animal will feel it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> This is 10 Zuz (about 10 ounces).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>STONES THAT MAY BE USED FOR <i>KINU'ACH</i> ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Zunin):</span> How big are rocks used for (Kinu'ach, i.e. cleaning oneself after using) the Beis ha'Kisei? (Such rocks are not Muktzeh; also, they are useful, one who is Motzi them is liable.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabanan):</span> One is the size of an olive, one is the size of a nut, one is the size of an egg.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Zunin):</span> Must one take in a scale [to ensure that the rocks are the right sizes}?! (Presumably, Rabanan held that one prepares the rocks beforehand; Zunin objects, for sometimes one does not have rocks prepared.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Rabanan):</span> Rather, one takes in a handful [even if there are four or five].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> One may take in three rocks, the sizes are that of an olive, a nut, and an egg;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Shimon b'Rebbi Yosi says in the name of R. Yosi, one takes in a handful.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may take three pointy rocks into a Beis ha'Kisei;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What size rocks are permitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Meir):</span> Each is a k'Zayis;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehudah):</span> Each is a k'Beitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rafram bar Papa):</span> They argue about the size of an Esrog just like they argue about Kinu'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The argument about Esrog is a Mishnah, the argument about Kinu'ach is only a Beraisa! (Rafram's teaching is useless - anyone who knows the argument about Kinu'ach surely knows the argument about Esrog!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Rafram teaches that they argue about Kinu'ach just like they argue about the size of an Esrog.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Payis is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Payis?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> It is vetch of Bavel (clods of earth, they are not good for Kinu'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> On Shabbos it is forbidden to use a rock [to help oneself move his bowels] the way he does on a weekday (it may detach hairs)..</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Mar Zutra):</span> If so, he will be in danger [if he needs to excrete but cannot]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He uses it awkwardly (e.g. he holds it with only two fingers).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>STONES THAT MAY BE USED FOR <i>KINU'ACH</i> ON SHABBOS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> If there is a fixed place for the Beis ha'Kisei, he may take a handful of rocks;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> If not, he may take [a rock] k'Hechra (the amount in the middle, a nut - it is between k'Zayis and k'Beitzah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> If not, he may take k'Hechra (Tosfos - like a leg; Rif - like the head) of a spice pounder. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> If there is an Ed (sign that it had been used for Kinu'ach) on it (Rashi - on a spice pounder - otherwise, it is Muktzeh; Tosfos - on rocks of any size and quantity), it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Ten things lead to hemorrhoids - eating leaves of reeds or of vines, or vine tendrils (the part that clings to supporting poles), meat that is not smooth, the spine of a fish, salted fish that was not cooked enough, drinking dregs of wine, cleaning oneself with one of three things that someone else used to clean himself, i.e. plaster, a shard of Cheres (earthenware), or a rock. (This shows that one should not clean with something that was already used!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some say, even suspending oneself [on his knees] too much in the Beis ha'Kisei causes hemorrhoids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is no good if it is wet, it is fine if it is dry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is no good if it was used from both sides, it is fine if it was used from only one side (one will use the other side).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> One may use something he used before to clean himself, one should not use something that someone else used.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If rain washed away the Ed, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> If a trace of the Ed remains, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar Rav Shila):</span> May one take Kinu'ach rocks up to the roof (Rashi - is it forbidden on account of exertion; Tosfos - is it forbidden because he should have prepared them before Shabbos)?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">81b----------------------------------------81b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> Kavod ha'Briyos (avoiding disgrace) overrides a Lav (a Chacham may ignore a lost object if it is below his dignity to carry it around - likewise, it overrides [Muktzeh and] all mid'Rabanan laws, which are based on "Lo Sasur" (do not veer from Chachamim's words)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina - Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> One may take a chip of wood to remove food between his teeth;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim permit only chips (Tosfos - fitting to go) in the feeding trough (animals can eat them - but one may not use Muktzeh, even if pieces of meat can be seen between his teeth)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A person plans where he will eat (he should prepare chips before Shabbos) - but he cannot always plan where he will eliminate (perhaps his intended place will be occupied)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> On Shabbos, one may not eliminate in a plowed field (that is ready to be planted).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He may not eliminate in [<i>another's</i>] plowed field because he tramples on the dirt (hardening it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, it should be forbidden even during the week!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This is because grass grows on the rocks (for Kinu'ach, he will detach it when he uses them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Reish Lakish taught that one may Mekane'ach with rocks with grass on them (the Halachah follows R. Shimon, who permits Davar she'Eino Miskaven); one who intentionally detaches the grass is Chayav Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We are concerned lest he take from a high place and return it to a depression - Rabah taught that one is liable for this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If someone filled a small pit in a house with dirt, he is liable for building; if he did so in a field, he is liable for [a Toladah of] plowing.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DETACHING FROM THE GROUND ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> One may Mekane'ach with rocks with grass on them; one who intentionally detaches is Chayav Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papi):</span> [This is not considered detaching -] therefore, one may likewise move Parfisa (a flowerpot with a hole (or basket filled with dirt) with something growing inside).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Kahana):</span> It is permitted for a need (Kavod ha'Briyos, i.e. Kinu'ach) - perhaps it is forbidden without a need!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If Parfisa was on the ground and one put it on pegs, he is liable for detaching (Rashi, Tosfos - he is lashed mid'Rabanan - mid'Oraisa, it is still attached and nurtures from the ground through the air; Rambam - he is Chayav mid'Oraisa; R. Chayim - the Rambam holds that even though it still nurtures [and is considered to be growing] from the ground, it is not considered attached).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was on pegs and one put it on the ground, he is liable (Rashi, Tosfos -mid'Rabanan) for planting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It is forbidden to use Cheres for Kinu'ach on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is dangerous [lest it uproot the anal 'teeth'], it would be forbidden even during the week!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is forbidden on account of witchcraft (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, it would be forbidden even during the week!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is forbidden because it may detach hairs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is Davar she'Eino Miskaven (we know that R. Yochanan permits this)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Noson bar Oshaya):</span> R. Yochanan teaches, not only it is forbidden during the week [on account of danger or witchcraft] - rather, even on Shabbos, when one might have thought that [in spite of this] it is permitted because it has Toras Kli (it is better than rocks, which are Muktzeh) - he teaches, this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rava learned like Answer #3.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rava):</span> Here, R. Yochanan forbids Davar she'Eino Miskaven - elsewhere, he permits!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah follows a Stam (anonymous) Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Nazir may smooth his hair and separate the hairs [even though he might pull out hairs], but he may not comb his hair (Rashi - this surely pulls out hairs; Rashba - one who combs intends to remove dangling hairs).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must answer like Rav Noson bar Oshaya.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the concern for witchcraft?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Chisda and Rabah bar Rav Huna were going in a boat; a woman wanted to sit near them - they refused.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She said something, causing the boat to stop; they said something which allowed it to move.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The woman:</span> I cannot overcome you [through witchcraft], for you do not use Cheres for Kinu'ach, you do not kill lice on your clothing, and you do not eat vegetables from the bundle [without untying it - this shows that all of these make people vulnerable to witchcraft].</p>
