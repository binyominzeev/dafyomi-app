<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THINGS THAT KNEAD THEMSELVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah, who says that [merely] putting water into dye is considered soaking it (one who does so on Shabbos is liable, therefore Beis Shamai forbid causing it to happen on Shabbos)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> It is Rebbi:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If Reuven put flour [into a trough] and Shimon put water, Shimon is liable [for kneading];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah exempts, unless he [overtly] kneaded.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Perhaps R. Yosi exempts only regarding flour, for it is Bar Givul (must be kneaded), but he is Mechayev regarding dye, for it suffices to add water (it mixes by itself)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That cannot be!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If Reuven put Efer (ashes) and Shimon put water, Shimon is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah exempts, unless he kneaded (even though ashes are not Bar Givul)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the Beraisa does not mean Efer, rather, Afar (dirt, which is Bar Givul)! (Maharitz Chiyus - we know that Efer is called Afar (Bamidbar 19:17), perhaps Afar is also called Efer.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Another Beraisa says that they argue about Afar (surely, both Beraisos do not teach the same thing)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The two Beraisos were not taught together (perhaps both teach about dirt)!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SHEVISAS KELIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following are permitted just before Shabbos, even though the activity will continue during all of Shabbos:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may dig a trench that will cause water [from a spring] to irrigate a garden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One may put incense [over a fire and] under clothes to scent the clothing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One may put sulfur [over a fire and] under Kelim for the sake of engraving on them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>One may put a bandage on an eye or wound that will cause it to heal;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>However, one may not put wheat in a water mill unless it will be ground before Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> This is because the mill makes noise (it is a disgrace to Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> It is forbidden on account of Shevisas Kelim (one must allow his vessels to rest on Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Uv'Chol Asher Amarti Aleichem Tishameru" - this commands about Shevisas Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If [even] Beis Hillel say that Shevisas Kelim is mid'Oraisa, why may one put incense or sulfur under Kelim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is permitted because the Kli does not do an action (it merely holds the incense, unlike the mill, which grinds).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Beis Hillel permit putting flax in an oven?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The oven does not do an action (it passively holds in the heat).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Beis Hillel permit setting traps - they do an action (they snap shut)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They discuss hooks and narrow mouthed cages, the fish or animal gets stuck by itself, the trap does not do an action.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>We can answer these questions differently according to R. Oshaya:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> The Beraisa that derives Shevisas Kelim from a verse is like Beis Shamai, but Beis Hillel disagree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Questions (m), (o), (q)):</span> Beis Shamai require Shevisas Kelim even from passive Melachah, Beis Hillel are not concerned even for active Melachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Beis Shamai forbid even passive Melachah, why do they permit incense and sulfur?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">18b----------------------------------------18b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The incense or sulfur is on the ground, not in a Kli.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Some Melachos require a Kli on Shabbos or Yom Tov -) why do Beis Shamai permit [brewing beer] in a barrel [for more than a week, i.e. including Shabbos, burning oil in] a lamp, [leaving food in] a pot [on a fire, it gets more cooked, and the Korban Pesach on] a spit [while roasting]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beis Shamai require one to make these Kelim Hefker (before Shabbos - one is commanded only about his Kelim; Rashba - Chachamim make the Kelim Hefker on Shabbos [and restore ownership after Shabbos]).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DECREES LEST ONE STOKE COALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the following Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A woman may not fill a pot with lupines or Asasiyos (peas?) (they must be cooked a long time) and put it in an oven just before Shabbos - if she did, it is forbidden Kedei she'Ya'asu (until it would get cooked had she put it in) after Shabbos (to avoid benefit from Melachah done [b'Isur] on Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Similarly, a baker may not fill a flask with water and put it in an oven just before Shabbos - if he did, it is forbidden Kedei she'Ya'asu after Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is Beis Shamai, it is unlike Beis Hillel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is even like Beis Hillel - this is a decree, lest one stoke the coals [on Shabbos to hasten the cooking].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> They should forbid [leaving] incense and sulfur [on a fire under Kelim just before Shabbos, for the same reason]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, one would not stoke, lest it make smoke which will be bad for the Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> They should forbid leaving flax in an oven!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One would not do so, for opening the oven lets in wind, which is bad for the flax.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> They should forbid leaving dye in a pot!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> They permit when the pot is off the fire.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, it should be forbidden, lest he stir the pot (Tosfos - helping to dye the wool faster and better, he would be liable for this; Rosh - he would be liable for cooking)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the pot is plastered shut (it is an exertion to open it, before doing so he would remember that it is Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>FOODS THAT MAY BE LEFT COOKING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Deduction:</span> Because leaving a pot in an oven before Shabbos is forbidden [only] lest one stoke the coals, it is permitted to leave a pot with raw food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it will not be ready to eat at night, he puts it out of his mind [until morning, when it will be ready in any case], he will not stoke the coals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>It is permitted to leave a pot with fully cooked food;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>It is forbidden to leave a pot with partially cooked food;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he adds to the pot a raw bone, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Deduction:</span> We said that we are not concerned in a case when wind would be harmful (for he would not open the oven) - therefore, one may leave kid meat in a sealed (plastered) oven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>[Wind is not harmful for ram meat - therefore,] one may not leave ram meat in an unsealed oven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> One may leave kid meat [even] in an unsealed oven, or ram meat in a sealed oven;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah mi'Difti):</span> Both of these are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> One may not leave meat, onions or eggs to roast unless there is time for them to get roasted before Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah forbids ram meat in an unsealed oven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> All permit kid meat, even in an unsealed oven, and ram meat in a sealed oven;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>They argue about ram meat in an unsealed oven - Rav Ashi permits, R. Yirmeyah forbids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> One may not leave meat, onions or eggs to roast unless there is time for them to get roasted before Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah forbids meat on coals (there is no covering, one is very prone to stoke them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> Raw gourds may be left [in an oven] - since wind is bad for it, it is like kid meat.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>LIMITATIONS OF SELLING TO NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> One may not sell, lend or give something to a Nochri unless [enough time remains so] he can reach his house before Shabbos (for it looks like the Nochri carries on behalf of the Yisrael);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Hillel permit if he can reach the first house in his city;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Akiva permits if he can leave the Yisrael's door before Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, R. Akiva [does not argue with Beis Hillel, he] argues with the previous Tana about Beis Hillel's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> One may not sell Chametz to a Nochri unless he knows that the Nochri will finish it before Pesach;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Beis Hillel permit selling Chametz as long as it is permitted to eat it (until the fifth hour on Erev Pesach).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Yehudah says, all kinds of Kutach (dips made with Chametz, they are consumed very slowly) may not be sold 30 days before Pesach.</p>
