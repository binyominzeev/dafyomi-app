<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MOSHE REFUTES THE ANGELS AT <i>KABALAS HA'TORAH</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Moshe:</span> It says "Zachor Es Yom ha'Shabbos Lekadsho" - do you do Melachah from which you must cease?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>It says "Lo Sisa [Es Shem Hash-m Elokecha la'Shav]" - do you do business [and have need for oaths]?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>It says "Kaved Es Avicha v'Es Imkecha" - do you have parents?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>It says "Lo Sirtzach Lo Sin'af Lo Signov" - do you have envy and a Yetzer ha'Ra [which brings one to do these]?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The angels admitted to Hash-m [that the [entire] Torah should be given to man] - "Hash-m Adoneinu Mah Adir Shimcha b'Chol ha'Aretz" - this latter verse does not say 'Tenah Hocha Al ha'Shomayim'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Immediately, every angel loved Moshe, and gave him [a secret of Torah] - "Alisa la'Marom Shavisa Shevi Lakachas Matanos ba'Adam", to compensate for having contemptuously called you 'Adam'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even the Satan (angel of death) gave a secret - (in the plague following Korach's rebellion, Moshe told Aharon) "Va'Yiten Es ha'Ketores va'Ychaper Al ha'Am; Va'Ya'amod Bein ha'Mesim u'Vein ha'Chayim" - had the Satan not told Moshe, how would he know that Ketores stops a plague?!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHERE THE SATAN DID AT <i>KABALAS HA'TORAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> When Moshe descended from Shomayim, the Satan asked Hash-m where is [the secret part of] Torah; He said that He gave Torah to the land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Satan asked [the angel appointed over] the land - [it claimed ignorance,] "Elokim Hevin Darkah..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He asked the sea and the depth - they denied having it, "Tehom Omer Lo Vi v'Yam Amar Ein Imadi; Avadon v'Maves Amru b'Azneinu Shomanu Shim'ah (destruction and death said that they heard that Torah was given, but they did not know where)".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He told Hash-m that he did not find it anywhere in the land; Hash-m told him to go to Moshe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Satan (to Moshe):</span> Where is the Torah that Hash-m gave to you?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Moshe:</span> Who am I that Hash-m should give to me His Torah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> Moshe, do you lie?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Moshe:</span> Your hidden treasure, which You delight in every day, can I say that I have it?! (I was not worthy of its secrets, just You spread Your Shechinah over me!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> Since you lowered yourself, it will be called by your name - "Zichru Toras Moshe Avdi".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> When Moshe ascended, he found Hash-m tying crowns to the letters.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> You don't give Shalom (greetings)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Moshe:</span> Does a slave give Shalom to his master?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> You should 'help' me (give me a Berachah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Moshe:</span> "V'Ata Yigdal Na Ko'ach Hash-m ka'Asher Dibarta" (this verse is written after the Meraglim - R. Yehoshua ben Levi must have had a tradition that Moshe said it when he ascended).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> "Va'Yar ha'Am Ki Boshesh Moshe" - we read this Ba Shesh (the sixth hour came);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Before Moshe ascended, he told Yisrael that he will return after 40 days in the sixth hour. [Rashi - he meant 40 full days, not including the day he ascended.] On the 40th day [counting the day of ascent] the Satan confused the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Satan:</span> Where is Moshe?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Yisrael:</span> He ascended to Shomayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The Satan told them that the sixth hour came; they ignored him. He told them that Moshe died; they ignored him. He showed them an image of Moshe [dead] on a bed - Yisrael said to Aharon "Ki Zeh Moshe ha'Ish...(we don't know what happened to him)".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (a Chacham):</span> Why is it called Har <i>Sinai</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Kahana):</span> It is the mount on which Nisim (miracles) were done for Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection (the Chacham):</span> If so, it should be called Nisai!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Kahana):</span> Rather, it is the mount on which good Simanim (omens) were done for Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection (the Chacham):</span> If so, it should be called Simnai!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">The Chacham:</span> You should learn from Rav Papa and Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua, who delve into the Agadic (non-Halachic) teachings of Rav Chisda and Rabah bar Rav Huna!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Chisda and Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> It is the mount from which caused [Hash-m to have] Sin'ah (hatred) for Nochrim [for refusing Torah].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Sinai has five names (Tosfos - there are five names for the large wilderness surrounding it, Maharsha - they are different places where Mitzvos were given to Yisrael, e.g. the Ohel Mo'ed and Arvos Mo'av - R. Yosi teaches that all these Mitzvos were already given on Sinai):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is called Midbar Tzin, because Yisrael were Nitztavu (commanded) there;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It is called Midbar Kadesh, because Yisrael were Niskadshu (sanctified) there;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>It (Arvos Mo'av) is called Midbar Kedmus, because Kedumah (the Torah, which was already given at Sinani) was given [again] there;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>It is called Midbar Paran, because Yisrael reproduced there (every wife became pregnant with a boy after Matan Torah).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">89b----------------------------------------89b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>It is called Midbar Sinai, for Sin'ah came to Nochrim on account of it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>It real name is Chorev.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>This is unlike R. Avahu:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> It real name is Sinai - it is called Chorev because Churvah (destruction) came to Nochrim on account of it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE MERCY OF THE <i>AVOS</i> ON THEIR CHILDREN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> What is the source to tie a red thread... ["Im Yihyu Chata'eichem ka'Shanim..."]</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should say 'ka'Shani' (singular, just like "ka'Sheleg Yalbinu" is singular)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> Hash-m tells Yisrael - [even] if your sins will be [numerous] like the years from creation until now, they will become white like snow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Questions (Rava):</span> Why does it say "Lechu Na (go)" - it should say Bo'u Na (come)! Why does it say "Yomar Hash-m" (in the future) - it should say Amar (past)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the future, Hash-m will tell Yisrael 'Go to the Avos, they will rebuke you';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Yisrael:</span> To whom should we go to? Should we go to Avraham, who was told "Yado'a Teda" (your descendants will be enslaved because you said "Ba'Mah Eda") and did not request mercy for us?! (Maharsha - Hash-m's Midah is to overlook the first transgression - Avraham did not request this, for he preferred that his sin be atoned for in this world.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Should we go to Yitzchak, who blessed Esav "V'Hayah ka'Asher Tarid (when Yakov declines, Esav will be master over him)"?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Should we go to Yakov, who was told "Anochi Ered Imcha Mitzraymah [v'Anochi A'alcha Gam Alo]" (alluding to four exiles), and did not request mercy for us?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>At this point Hash-m will say 'Since you desire My mercy, "Im Yihyu Chata'eichem ka'Shanim ka'Sheleg Yalbinu".'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> Why does it say "Ki Ata Avinu Ki Avraham Lo Yodanu v'Yisrael Lo Yakirenu Ata Hash-m Avinu Go'alenu me'Olam Shemecha"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the future Hash-m will tell Avraham 'Your children sinned' -he will say, 'They should be wiped out for the sake of Kidush Hashem'; (Maharsha - he meant that their sins should be wiped out [pardoned] for the sake of Kidush Hash-m - however, he was unclear, 'They should be wiped out' could refer to Yisrael, therefore Hash-m sought another reply).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> I will ask Yakov, who had great pain raising children - perhaps he will pray for them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Yakov responded like Avraham.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> The elder [Av] lacks reasoning, the younger lacks [good] counsel - I will ask Yitzchak.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Yitzchak:</span> Did <i>my</i> children sin - aren't they also Your children?! When Yisrael put Na'aseh before Nishma, didn't You call them "Beni Vechori" - why do you call them my sons now?! (Hash-m already called Yisrael "Beni Vechori" when he sent Moshe to Paro because they would later say Na'aseh v'Nishma; they received crowns of Kehunah and Malchus, which are appropriate for the firstborn.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Further, how much did they sin? Most people live only 70 years - deduct the first 20, for which You (Beis Din of Shomayim) do not punish; half of the remaining 50 are night (even people who are awake then do not sin much), only 25 years remain;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Half the daytime is occupied with prayer, eating, and the Beis ha'Kisei - only 12 and a half years remain;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If You will bear their sin alone, good; if You prefer, each of us will bear half; if You do not agree to this, I will bear all of it - I offered my soul for You [at the Akedah]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>Yisrael will then say "Ata Avinu"; Yitzchak will tell them to direct their praise to Hash-m, and point to Hash-m;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>Yisrael will look up to Shomayim and say "Ata Hash-m Avinu Go'alenu me'Olam Shemecha".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> It was fitting that Yakov descend to Mitzrayim in iron chains [to fulfill the decree of exile] - his merit caused that he descended honorably - "B'Chavlei Adam Emshachem b'Avosos Ahavah (in chains of love, not of iron) va'Ehyeh Lahem k'Merimei Ol (I will lift the yoke to reduce their burden) v'At Elav Ochil (I will give them strength to endure the harsh labor)".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHICH SPICES COMBINE FOR A <i>SHI'UR</i> OF <i>HOTZA'AH</i> ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur for Hotza'ah of wood is to cook a light egg (this always refers to k'Grogeres of a hen's egg);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Shi'ur for spices is to season a light egg - all different spices join with each other;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Shi'ur for nutshells, pomegranate peels, Istis and Pu'ah (plants used to make dye) is enough to dye a small garment in the middle of the headdress.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Shi'ur for urine, niter, Boris, Kemulia and Ashleg (these will be explained) is enough to launder a small garment in the middle of the headdress;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yehudah says, it is to pass over a Kesem (a bloodstain, to determine whether or not it is Dam Nidah or to remove it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> We already learned [the Shi'ur for wood] in another Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span>  The Shi'ur for a reed is to make a quill; if it was thick or cracked [and not fit for a quill], the Shi'ur is to cook a light egg, mixed in a frying pan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that that applies to a reed, which has no other use - but wood can be used for a tooth of a key, one is liable even for a tiny amount - the Mishnah teaches, this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur for spices is to season a light egg.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> A mixture of spices of two or three names (Tosfos - prohibitions) from the same species, or from three different species, join to forbid the food (b'Nosen Ta'am).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> If spices of two or three different prohibitions that are all from the same species, or from three different species, were mixed together, they forbid the food (b'Nosen Ta'am); if they were mixed with a dry food, they join to comprise the quantity which does not become Batul (e.g. for Terumah, one in 100). (End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> The case is, all the spices sweeten.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If they did not all sweeten, they would not join (but our Mishnah did not distinguish whether or not all sweeten)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Also in our Mishnah, all of the spices sweeten.</p>
