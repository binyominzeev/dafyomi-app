<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava says that R. Shimon ben Elazar is Metamei three fingers by three fingers of other garments - what is his source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from "O Veged".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Veged" only teaches that a [full] garment is Mekabel Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that even three Tefachim by three Tefachim is Mekabel Tum'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "O Veged".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Abaye, what do our Tana'im learn from "O Veged"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that three fingers by three fingers of wool and linen is Mekabel Tum'as Sheratzim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rava says, the Torah taught that they can receive Tzara'as, we learn that they also receive Tum'as Sheratzim, no other verse is needed for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> We cannot learn from Tzara'as - they have a stringency, even warp and woof receive Tzara'as!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Tzara'as cannot be more stringent - if so, the Torah would have taught [that three fingers receives Tum'ah] regarding Sheratzim, and we would learn to Tzara'as!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> We could not learn from Sheratzim to Tzara'as - Sheratzim have a stringency, the size of a lentil of a Sheretz is Metamei!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>TANA D'VEI REBBI YISHMAEL</i> CONTRADICT THEMSELVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The following Tana d'vei R. Yishmael argues on the Tana d'vei R. Yishmael of the previous Beraisa (26B):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'vei R. Yishmael - Beraisa):</span> "Veged" - one might have thought, only garments of (sheep's) wool and linen receive Tum'as Sheratzim - "O Veged" teaches that also garments of camel's of rabbit's wool, goat's hair, silk, Kalach and frayed silk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Resolution #1: Rava):</span> They do not argue - they agree that three fingers of other garments does not receive Tum'ah, but three Tefachim does!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rava said above that only R. Shimon ben Elazar holds that way, but Tana d'vei R. Yishmael says that other garments never receive Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rava retracted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rava did not say this (Resolution #1), rather, Rav Papa [gave a slightly different answer].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Resolution #2 - Rav Papa):</span> When the previous Tana d'vei R. Yishmael (26B) said 'in all places, ['Veged'] refers to wool and linen', he referred to Sha'atnez (and not to Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why would he have to teach that - it explicitly says "Lo Silbash Sha'atnez Tzemer u'Fishtim Yachdav"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought, that only applies to wearing Sha'atnez - but the prohibition to put Sha'atnez on one's body [even without wearing it - "U'Veged Kil'ayim Sha'atnez Lo Ya'aleh Alecha"] applies to any two materials - holds that teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But a Kal va'Chomer teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The whole body benefits by wearing, yet the Torah forbids only wool and linen - putting the garment on the body [is less benefit], all the more so!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rav Papa's resolution is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MATERIALS THAT ARE OBLIGATED IN <i>TZITZIS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Resolution #3 - Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> When the previous Tana d'vei R. Yishmael (26B) said 'in all places, ['Veged'] refers to wool and linen', he referred to Tzitzis (and not to Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">27b----------------------------------------27b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should he have to teach that - the law is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Right after "Lo Silbash Sha'atnez Tzemer u'Fishtim Yachdav" it says "Gedilim Ta'aseh Lecha"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought to learn like Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rava):</span> One verse says "Ha'Kanaf" - the Tzitzis should be the same material as the corner (this implies that Tzitzis applies to garments of any material);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>But Tzitzis is written adjacent to "Tzemer u'Fishtim Yachdav"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Fringes of wool and linen are Kosher for any garment; fringes of any other material are Kosher only for garments of that material.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Tana d'vei R. Yishmael teaches unlike Rava, i.e. Tzitzis applies only to wool and linen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Acha brei d'Rava):</span> Tana d'vei R. Yishmael includes other garments regarding Tum'ah because it says "O Veged";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should include other garments also regarding Tzitzis - it says "Asher Techaseh Bah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> That comes to include the garment of a blind man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "And you will see it" - this excludes a night garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it excludes a blind man's garment, not a night garment!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Asher Techaseh Bah" includes a blind man's garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [The inclusion and exclusion are not specific -] why don't we learn the opposite way (include a night garment and exclude a blind man's garment)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable to include a blind man's garment, which other people see, than a night garment, which no one sees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we say that the inclusion is for garments of other materials?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse is right after "Tzemer u'Fishtim" - presumably, it includes garments of wool and linen, not of other materials.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>PREPARATION TO RECEIVE TZARA'AS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> R. Shimon ben Elazar and Sumchus agree with each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He refers to R. Shimon's teaching above (26A, that linen is the only tree derivative Pasul for Sechach. He is Posel even linen that was not spun or woven, for it receives Tzara'as.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Sumchus):</span> If one covered a Sukah with anything spun it is Pasul, because it receives Tzara'as. (Tosfos - R. Shimon ben Elazar agrees that it is Pasul mid'Oraisa only if it was spun.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question:</span> Like whom does Sumchus hold?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question:</span> Like whom does Abaye hold? (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like R. Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Warp and woof (Tosfos - of wool) receive Tzara'as immediately;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, warp receives [Tzara'as] after it is removed from the pot; woof receives immediately; bundles of flax (Tosfos - linen threads) receive after they are whitened in the oven.</p>
