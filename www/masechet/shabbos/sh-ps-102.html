<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one threw [something b'Shogeg] and remembered [that it was Shabbos] after it left his hand, and someone else or a dog caught it, or it burned in the air, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one threw to wound a person or animal, and remembered [the Isur Shabbos] before it made the wound, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The general rule is, one is not Chayav Chatas unless he was Shogeg at the beginning and at the end;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was Shogeg at the beginning and Mezid at the end, or Mezid at the beginning and Shogeg at the end, he is not liable unless he was Shogeg at the beginning and the end.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> Had it [not been caught or burned, rather,] landed, he would be liable, even though he remembered before it landed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> One is not Chayav Chatas unless he was Shogeg at the beginning and at the end.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Kahana):</span> The Seifa discusses throwing a clasp on a rope (he holds the rope and could stop the clasp - therefore, if he remembers before it lands, it is as if he threw [partially] b'Mezid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If he threw a clasp on a rope [and holds the rope] it is Agud b'Yado (he is exempt in any case)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he intended to wound (Agud b'Yado exempts only regarding Hotza'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Mishnah already teaches that explicitly!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one threw to wound, and remembered before it made the wound, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Seifa discusses Ma'avir (carrying).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, the general rule of the Seifa refers to throwing (for the entire Mishnah discussed throwing)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> The Reisha discusses two cases:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one threw and remembered after it left his hand, or even if he did not remember, and someone else or a dog caught it, or it burned in the air, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ashi):</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated, it means as follows</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one threw and remembered after it left his hand, and someone else or a dog caught it, or it burned in the air, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it landed, he would be liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This is if he later forgot again - but if he did not forget again he is exempt, for one is not Chayav Chatas unless he was Shogeg at the beginning and at the end.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The general rule is, one is not Chayav Chatas...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If he was Shogeg while the object went two Amos, was Mezid during the next two Amos, and Shogeg during two Amos after that, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> He is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> Even R. Gamliel, who says that Yedi'ah (finding out) after half a Shi'ur has no effect, would exempt here - he obligates only when one completes the Shi'ur b'Shogeg, here he was Mezid at the end!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What case does Rabah discuss?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He cannot discuss throwing - there, he is considered Shogeg (since even when he remembered in the middle, he could not stop it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He discusses Ma'avir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Even Chachamim, who say that Yedi'ah after half a Shi'ur exempts, would Mechayev here - they exempt only when one can refrain from completing the Shi'ur, he cannot!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What case does Rava discuss?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He cannot discuss Ma'avir - there, also, he could refrain from completing the Shi'ur!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He discusses throwing.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SOMETHING CAUGHT IN MIDAIR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one threw and it landed in the mouth of a dog or in an oven, he is liable. (He was Shogeg the entire time, or Mezid the entire time.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> ...If someone else or a dog caught it, or it burned in the air, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is when he did not intend for it to be caught or burned - Rava obligates when he intended for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Bivi bar Abaye - Mishnah):</span> One can be liable four Chata'os and an Asham for one eating [slightly more than a k'Zayis] - a Tamei person who ate on Yom Kipur Chelev that was Nosar from Kodshim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir says, if it was also Shabbos and he was Motzi the food in his mouth, he is also liable for Hotza'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> That Chatas is not for eating.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is not normal to be Motzi in the mouth!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he intends to eat, he makes the mouth a proper way to be Motzi</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Culmination of the support):</span> Here also, since he intended for it to be caught or burned, he makes the recipient a proper place for Hanachah!</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BUILDING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> How much must one build to be liable?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One is liable for any amount of building, smoothing rocks, making a final blow with a hammer (Tosfos - to finish a Kli; Rashi - to quarry a rock) or hatchet, or drilling;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The general rule is - on Shabbos, one is liable for any Melachah that lasts (i.e. sometimes one does not do more than this).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, even one who bangs a hammer on an anvil [and not on the Kli being made] while making the Kli is liable, for this improves the final product (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> [If one builds] a tiny amount, what use does it have?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmiyah):</span> A poor person digs a tiny hole to hide his Perutos (small coins);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Correspondingly in the Mishkan, people who sewed curtains dug tiny holes to hide needles.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> They would not do so, lest the needles rust!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> A poor person makes legs (e.g. a tripod) for a small oven on which he rests a pot;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Correspondingly, if they needed to dye a bit more wool for curtains, they would make legs for a small oven on which to rest a small pot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> In the place of wealth (Hekdesh), we do not conduct like paupers (from the beginning they prepared all materials in abundance)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> If one has a small hole in his house, he fills it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Correspondingly, if a worm ate a hole in a board, they melted lead into it to fill it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If one sets a rock [in a foundation for a building] he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven put a rock down and Shimon put the mud [to cement it in place], Shimon is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> [Sometimes] one is liable even without setting it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa - R. Yosi):</span> Even if he lifted it and put it on a row of rocks [to make a wall], he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> There are three levels of rocks:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Foundation rocks must be set and need dirt (one is not liable without this); intermediate rocks also need mud; upper rocks merely need to be placed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Smoothing rocks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> For which Av is he liable?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> He is liable for building.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> He is liable for Makeh b'Patish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one makes a hole in a chicken coop, he is liable for building;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> He is liable for Makeh b'Patish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one drives a peg into the handle of a hoe (so the blade will not fall off), he is liable for building;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(v)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> He is liable for Makeh b'Patish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(w)</span>The argument had to be taught in all three cases:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we only taught about smoothing rocks, one might have thought that there Rav is Mechayev for building, for it is the normal way of building, but not for making a hole in a chicken coop;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If we only taught about a hole in a chicken coop, one might have thought that there Rav is Mechayev for building, for it is made for air and resembles building, but not for driving a peg into a handle;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If we only taught regarding driving in a peg, one might have thought that Shmuel would agree in the other cases, for they are [or resemble] the normal way of building.</p>
