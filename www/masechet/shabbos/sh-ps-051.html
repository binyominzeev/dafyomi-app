<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PERFORMING <i>HATMANAH</i> TO KEEP SOMETHING COLD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it (a pot) was not covered before Shabbos, one may not cover it on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If it was covered and became exposed, one may cover it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One may fill a flask [of cold water] and put it under a pillow or blanket [to keep it cold].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Shmuel):</span> One may Matmin something cold [to keep it cold].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> We already learn this from our Mishnah - one may fill a flask and put it under a pillow or blanket!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> One might have thought that this is permitted only regarding things [like water (Rashi; Tosfos ha'Rosh - wine)] that people do not normally Matmin [to keep them warm], but not regarding things [like a Tavshil] that people normally Matmin - Shmuel teaches that both of these are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna citing Rebbi):</span> One may not Matmin something cold.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Rebbi permitted Hatmanah of something cold.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Huna cited what Rebbi said at first, the Beraisa is after Rebbi heard R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi [cite his father]:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> Hatmanah of cold food is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi:</span> My father permitted it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> The elder has already ruled (I retract)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> See how much Chachamim endeared each other! Had R. Yosi been alive, he would have sat humbly in front of Rebbi, just like his son did - R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi was as great as his father;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nevertheless, Rebbi showed honor to R. Yosi by saying 'The elder has already ruled'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>On Shabbos, Rav Nachman told his slave to Matmin water; on a weekday, he told his slave to bring hot water from a Nochri. R. Ami was upset.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> R. Ami should not have been upset - Rav Nachman followed his Rebbi'im, Rav and Shmuel!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One may Matmin something cold.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Bishul Akum (the Isur mid'Rabanan to eat something cooked by a Nochri) does not apply to something that can be eaten raw.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Ami holds that an important person should be stringent.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE COVERING OF A POT THAT IS <i>TAMUN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Even though on Shabbos Hatmanah is forbidden even in something that does not add heat, one may increase the coverings;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, one may remove the sheet it was wrapped in and Matmin in a coat [which insulates better], or vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Similarly, R. Shimon ben Gamliel taught [another leniency -] Hatmanah is forbidden only in the kettle that was on the fire - if one transferred the water to another kettle, one may Matmin the latter kettle.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>[Hatmanah on Shabbos is forbidden lest one heat the food beforehand -] since he cools the food [by transferring it to another kettle], we are not concerned lest he heat it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If one covered a pot with something that may be moved [on Shabbos], whether Hatmanah (surrounding the pot) was done in something that may or may not be moved, one may take [the pot, to take food] and return [it];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If one covered with something that may not be moved, whether Hatmanah was done in something that may or may not be moved:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the pot was partially uncovered, one may take and return; if not, not.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">51b----------------------------------------51b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yehudah says, fine chaff of linen is like manure (it adds heat, one may not Matmin in it even from before Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>[On Shabbos] one may put a [copper] kettle on top of a kettle, or a [Cheres] pot on top of a pot, or a pot on top of a kettle (this text is according to the comment in the margin), but not a kettle on top of a pot (for the kettle retains heat better, it will heat the pot. Rashi's preferred text permits even this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may seal the opening of the pot with dough (kneaded from before Shabbos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One may not put one pot or kettle on top of another in order to warm the top one, it is permitted to do so just to keep it warm.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Just like [on Shabbos] one may not Matmin something hot, one may not Matmin something cold.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rebbi permits Hatmanah of something cold.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>One may not crush hail or snow in order to melt it; one may put it in a cup or bowl [to cool off liquid inside].</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>SHEMIRAH</i> THAT IS NECESSARY FOR DIFFERENT ANIMALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> What may animals go out with on Shabbos? (A person is commanded that his animal rest on Shabbos; it may wear something [normally] used for Shemirah (to protect the animal, or to prevent it from running away. Tosfos (53A Mahu) - we ask about Reshus ha'Rabim; regarding animals we do not forbid in a Chatzer.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A camel may go out with a halter (a noose around the head), a Na'akah may go out with a Chotem (these will be translated), Luvdakim may go out with Prumbi'a, a horse may go out with a chain [around the neck with a ring in it, one leads the horse by a rope going through the ring];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>All Ba'alei Shir (animals that normally go out with a chain) may go out with a chain and are pulled by a chain [on Shabbos].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>[If it became Tamei], one may sprinkle [Mei Chatas] on it and immerse it while it is in place (on the animal; we are not concerned lest the animal be a Chatzitzah, i.e. if it is too tight).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is a Na'akah with a Chotem?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> It is a white camel (Me'iri - mule) with an iron ring (it goes through a hole pierced in the wall in the middle of the nose - this is a great Shemirah, for it is prone to run away).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Luvdakim with Prumbi'a.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> This is a donkey from Luv with an iron halter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Levi sent money to Bei Chuzai, and asked them to buy a donkey from Luv (they are big and fast); they returned his money with barley, hinting to him that [one need not make the long journey to Luv to get a good donkey,] a local donkey is fine if he will constantly feed it barley.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> People asked Rebbi whether or not an animal may go out with Shemirah which is permitted for a different animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We need not ask about a white camel with a halter - since it is insufficient Shemirah, surely it is like carrying a load;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We ask about a [regular] camel with an iron nose-ring - since a halter would suffice, it is like a load;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Or, perhaps excessive Shemirah is not considered a load.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi:</span> My father taught that four animals go out with a halter - a horse, mule, camel and donkey.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A camel may go out with a halter, but not with a nose-ring!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, we infer that a camel may go out with a halter, but a white camel may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A donkey of Luv or a camel may go out with a halter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Tana'im argue about whether or not excessive Shemirah is considered a load:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Chayah may not go out with a noose;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chananyah permits a noose, and anything that guards it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot discuss a large Chayah - surely, a noose does not suffice!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It discusses a small Chayah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A noose surely suffices (the first Tana would not forbid)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They argue about a cat:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The first Tana holds that since a small rope suffices for it, a noose is a load; Chananyah holds that excessive Shemirah is not considered a load.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna bar Chiya citing Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows Chananyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Rabah bar Rav Huna and Levi, the son of Rav Huna bar Chiya were riding together on donkeys. Levi's donkey went in front of Rabah's; Rabah was upset (he thought that Levi did so intentionally, even though Rabah was a bigger Chacham). Levi sought to [show that it was unintentional to] appease him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question (Levi):</span> May a wicked animal like my donkey go out with an iron halter [or is this excessive Shemirah]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> Your father taught that the Halachah follows Chananyah (it is permitted even if it would be excessive Shemirah).</p>
