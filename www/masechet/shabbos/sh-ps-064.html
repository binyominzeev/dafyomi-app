<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TUM'AH OF SAK</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Sak has an advantage over Beged - it is Tamei on account of Arig.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Beged is also Arig (what is the advantage of Sak)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Sak is Tamei even if it is not Arig.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is it useful for?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> A poor person braids three strands and hangs it on his daughter's neck.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Sak" - this only teaches that Sak is Mekabel Tum'ah [from a Sheretz];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to include a harness strap or band [made from goats' hair]?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "O Sak" includes these.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we include even ropes and strings (they are braided, not spun)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Sak" - we include only what is like Sak, i.e. it is spun and woven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Regarding Tum'as Mes it says "V'Chol Kli Or v'Chol Ma'ase Izim,,,Tischata'u" - this includes a harness strap and band.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we include even ropes and strings!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Regarding Tum'as Sheretz we include only what is spun and woven - the same should apply to Tum'as Mes!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Tum'as Sheretz is lenient, therefore it applies only to what is spun and woven - but Tum'as Mes is more stringent (it makes an Av ha'Tum'ah, which requires seven days and sprinkling of Mei Chatas to become Tahor), perhaps it applies to more things!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Beged v'Or" between Tum'as Sheratzim and Tum'as Mes, also the latter applies only to what is spun and woven;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Also, [the Gezerah Shavah teaches that] just like everything made from goats is Mekabel Tum'as Mes, it is Mekabel Tum'as Sheretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for [Tum'as Sheratzim of] something made from horse hair or a cow's tail?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "O Sak" includes these.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We used "O Sak" to include a harness strap or band!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was before we knew the Gezerah Shavah - now that we know the Gezerah Shavah, we learn these from Tum'as Mes, "O Sak" teaches about horse hair and a cow's tail.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that these Mekabel Tum'as Mes?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Since they are Mekabel Tum'as Sheratzim, just like Kelim from goats, they are like Kelim from goats to Mekabel Tum'as Mes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There are many sources of Tum'as Erev (Sheratzim, Nevelah, semen...) - we cannot learn to Tum'as Shivah, which only comes from a Mes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Beged v'Or" between Tum'as Sheratzim and Tum'as Mes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We must say that the Gezerah Shavah is Mufneh (the word(s) we learn from are extra, we do not challenge such a Gezerah Shavah), otherwise we could challenge it - k'Adashah (the size of a lentil) of a Sheretz is Metamei, but only k'Zayis (a bigger Shi'ur) of a Mes is Metamei! (Tosfos ha'Rosh - this is a real challenge, the above challenge [that Tum'as Erev is more prevalent] was not.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Affirmation:</span> Yes, the Gezerah Shavah is Mufneh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sheratzim are equated to semen - "Ish Asher Teztei Mimenu Shichvas Zera; O Ish Asher Yiga b'Chol Sheretz";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says regarding semen "V'Chol Beged v'Chol Or Asher Yihyeh Alav Shichvas Zera" [is Tamei] - we could learn about Sheratzim from the Hekesh to semen, why does it say "Beged v'Or" regarding Sheratzim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Beged v'Or" regarding Sheratzim is extra, for the Gezerah Shavah [to Tum'as Mes].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is Mufneh from one side (one of the sources we learn from is extra) - this is like the opinion that we learn from a Gezerah Shavah Mufneh from one side, but do not challenge it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that we challenge such a Gezerah Shavah, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is Mufneh from both sides;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Mes is [also] equated to Shichvas Zera - "Veha'Noge'a b'Chol Temei Nefesh O Ish Asher Teztei Mimenu Shichvas Zera", therefore "Beged v'Or" regarding Mes is [likewise] extra.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>INNER TACHSHITIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Va'Nakrev Es Korban Hash-m...Cheli Zahav Etz'adah v'Tzamid Taba'as Agil v'Chumaz Lechaper Al Nafshoseinu" - Agil is a bra; Chumaz is a girdle;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> The Targum [of Chumaz] is Mechuch - something that leads to Gichuch (frivolity).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support #2 (Rabah):</span> Chumaz is an acronym for 'Kan Makom Zimah (this is the place of illicit relations).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> "Va'Yiktzof Moshe Al Pekudei ha'Chayil" - Moshe suspected that the soldiers [who defeated Midyan] had sinned [in Zenus, like at Shitim].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The soldiers:</span> "Lo Nifkad Mimenu Ish" (everyone acted like Yisrael)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Moshe:</span> If so, why are you bringing an atonement?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">The soldiers:</span> We did not do a sinful action, but perhaps we had sinful thoughts (Tosfos - there are limits on the Heter to take a woman in war).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'vei R. Yishmael):</span> The soldiers needed [to bring the Kelim for] an atonement for getting pleasure from seeing forbidden women.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">64b----------------------------------------64b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> The Torah lists external Tachshitim (e.g. rings) with inner Tachshitim (girdles) to teach that one who looks [for pleasure] at a woman's pinky needs atonement like one who looks at her Ervah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT WOMEN MAY GO OUT WITH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A woman may go out with strands of hair [used to braid her hair], whether the strands are from her own [detached] hair, or from another woman, or from an animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>She may go out with Totefes or Sarbitin (head ornaments) if they are sewn [into her headdress];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>She may go out with Kavul (a wool cap under her headdress; Tosfos - Shmuel (58A) holds that it is a signet of slavery) or with a wig [used to make it look like she has much hair] in a Chatzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>She may go out with tufts in her ear [to absorb wax], in her sandal [for comfort] or to absorb Dam Nidah [in that place].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>She may go out with a pepper [to counter odors], a salt crystal [to heal teeth] or anything in her mouth [from before Shabbos];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She may not put it in on Shabbos; if it fell out, she may not return it [because cures are forbidden on Shabbos; alternatively, it looks like a scheme to permit taking it out].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text):</span> R. Meir permits her to go out with an artificial tooth or a golden [cap for a] tooth;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (text of Rosh):</span> R. Meir permits her to go out with an artificial golden tooth;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #3 (brought in Rashi):</span> She may go out with an artificial tooth;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Meir permits her to go out with a golden tooth; (end of Version #3)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Chachamim forbid.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>GOING OUT WITH DETACHED HAIR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> We must teach all three cases of strands of hair:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we only taught about strands from her own hair, one might have thought that this is permitted for it does not entail disgrace, but hair from another woman is forbidden [lest others will mock her and she will take it off and carry it in Reshus ha'Rabim];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If we only taught about strands from [her or] another woman's hair, one might have thought that this is permitted for it is human hair, but hair from an animal is forbidden (it is more disgraceful).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text) (Beraisa):</span> A girl may not go out with hair of an old woman, nor an old woman with a girl's hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1A (Tosfos - Rav Pores) Question:</span> We understand why an old woman would [want to] go out with a girl's hair - it looks better than her own hair;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why would a girl [want to] go out with hair of an old woman?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, she would not - the Tana merely taught this for parallel structure with the law of an old woman with a girl's hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1B (Rashi) Question:</span> We understand why an old woman may not go out with a girl's hair - it looks nicer (perhaps she will remove it to show to others);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why can't a girl go out with hair of an old woman?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, she may - this clause was included with the law of an old woman with a girl's hair (even though the law does not apply here).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos' preferred text) (Beraisa):</span> An old woman may not go out with a girl's hair, nor a girl with an old woman's hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand the Chidush that an old woman may not go out with a girl's hair - even though it looks better, we are concerned lest she will be mocked and remove it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But there is no need to forbid a girl to go out with hair of an old woman (all the more so, she will be mocked and might remove it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, there is no Chidush - it was taught for parallel structure with the Reisha. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She may go out with Kavul or with a wig in a Chatzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Everything that Chachamim forbade to wear in Reshus ha'Rabim is forbidden in a Chatzer, except for Kavul and a wig.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Anani bar Sason citing R. Yishmael [b'Rebbi Yosi]):</span> Everything is [permitted in a Chatzer,] like Kavul and a wig.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> She may go out with Kavul or with a wig in a Chatzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Rav - but according to Rav Anani, why are these specified?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Anani cites the opinion of R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi, a Tana - he argues with our Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav, what is special about these, that only they are permitted in a Chatzer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> Chachamim permitted these, lest a husband be repulsed by his wife. (Rashba - they cover up a bald spot or a lack of hair. Tosfos - Shmuel explains, a signet of slavery assures a master that his slave does not intend to rebel.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Veha'Davah b'Nidasah" - early Chachamim forbade a Nidah to paint her eyes, apply rouge or adorn herself with colored clothing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva permitted these, lest a husband be repulsed by his wife; "Veha'Davah b'Nidasah" teaches that she is Nidah until she immerses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Anything forbidden on account of Mar'is ha'Ayin (suspicion) is forbidden even in private.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> [A donkey] may not go out with a bell, even if the clapper is plugged (because it looks like the owner takes it to sell it in the market).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may plug up the clapper and take it in the Chatzer (we are concerned for Mar'is ha'Ayin only in Reshus ha'Rabim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about this (Rav holds like R. Eliezer and R. Shimon):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> [If one's clothes became wet in the rain,] one may spread them to dry in the sun, but not in public view;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer and R. Shimon forbid.</p>
