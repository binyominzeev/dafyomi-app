<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur for ink is to write two letters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> [He is liable for] Hotza'ah of ink to write two letters whether the ink was dry, or on a quill, or in an inkwell.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If one was Motzi one letter's worth of dry ink and one letter's worth of ink on a quill, what is the law? (Rashi - he is not liable for the quill, it is Batul to ink less than a Shi'ur.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one was Motzi two letters [worth of ink] and wrote two letters while walking, he is liable [even if he did not stop walking] - writing them is considered Hanachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one was Motzi one letter, wrote it, then was Motzi another letter [in the same Helam] and wrote it, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He never had a Shi'ur [of ink that can be used to write] outside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one was Motzi a half-k'Grogeres [of food], did Hanachah, then was Motzi another half-k'Grogeres and did Hanachah, it is as if the first was eaten by a dog or burned, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is unreasonable - the first piece is there!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means, if he picked up the first piece before Hanachah of the second, it is as if the first was eaten or burned, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one was Motzi a half-k'Grogeres, did Hanachah, then was Motzi another half-k'Grogeres to the same place, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he liable - the second piece was not Nach!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he brought it within three Tefachim of the ground (it is considered Nach).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rava taught that Chachamim [who do not consider something in the air to be at rest] say that [even] if something within three Tefachim of the ground must be placed in something [to be considered Nach]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim say this concerning something thrown - Rava discusses something a person carries.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven was Motzi a half-k'Grogeres, and then was Motzi another half-k'Grogeres:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If both were in one Helam, he is liable; if they were in two Ha'alamos, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, in one Helam, if he took both to the same Reshus [ha'Rabim] he is liable; if he took them to different Reshuyos, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> This is only if the different Reshuyos [ha'Rabim] are separated by a Reshus [ha'Yachid] in which one is liable for transferring to them, but not if a Karmelis separates them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This is even if they are separated by a Karmelis, not if a piece of wood separates them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This is even if a piece of wood separates them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>This is as Rava taught elsewhere:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Reshuyos have the same law regarding [R. Yosi's law of] Shabbos as they do regarding Gitin. (If before Reuven threw a Get to his wife he lent her a place in his Chatzer to receive it, and it landed on a piece of wood, she is not divorced, for it is considered a Reshus unto itself - he only lent one place to her.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OTHER SHI'URIM OF HOTZA'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur for mascara is to paint one eye.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> People do not paint only one eye!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> Tzenu'os (women who dress very modestly and leave only one eye exposed) paint only one eye.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> The Shi'ur for mascara for healing is to paint one eye; the Shi'ur for adornment is to paint two eyes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Hilel brei d'Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> That is for villagers (people are not so frivolous there, there is no need for such modesty - our Mishnah discusses city women).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur for wax is to put on a seal of a small hole.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This refers to a seal for [a Kli of] wine (it is smaller than the hole for oil or honey, which are thicker).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur for glue is to put at the end of Shifshef.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The glue is put on the little plank at the end of a bird hunter's stick (birds gets stuck to it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur for pitch or sulfur is to seal a hole [in a Kli for mercury].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This refers to a small hole.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur for a ground brick is to make an opening in a furnace...[R. Yehudah says, to make a leg of a tripod].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Observation:</span> R. Yehudah's Shi'ur is bigger. (Ramban - this shows that R. Yehudah obligates only for a widespread usage, Chachamim Mechayev even for uses that are not so common.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Elsewhere, Chachamim's Shi'ur is bigger!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [The Shi'ur for Gemi (a soft reed) is to make a handle for hanging a sieve;] R. Yehudah says, it is in order to measure a child's foot for the sake of making shoes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah refers to a leg of a tripod for a small oven, it is less than Chachamim's Shi'ur.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">80b----------------------------------------80b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Shi'ur for hair is enough to knead mud (the Shi'ur made with a Revi'is of water, the least a person bothers to knead at a time; alternatively, the coming Shi'ur for Hotza'ah of mud - it is no bother to add hair to kneaded mud);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Shi'ur for mud is enough to make an opening for a furnace for refining gold.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE <i>SHI'UR</i> OF <i>HOTZA'AH</i> FOR PLASTER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur for plaster is to put [on the smallest of girls].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It is to put on the smallest finger of a girl.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Benos Yisrael who bring hairs while they are still minors [and are embarrassed about this]:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Poor girls put on plaster to remove them, rich girls use fine flour, princesses use Mor oil - "Shishah Chodoshim b'Shemen ha'Mor".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Mor oil?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna bar Chiya):</span> It is scented oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yirmeyah bar Aba):</span> It is oil of olives that did not reach a third of their [normal] growth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Anfiknon is oil of olives that did not reach a third of their growth; one anoints with it to remove hair and soften skin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav Bivi put plaster on his daughter, one limb at a time [beautifying her; many wanted to marry her,] Rav Bivi received 400 Zuz (about three years of a standard income) Kidushin money for her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He had a Nochri neighbor who plastered his daughter all at once - she died [because she could not sweat], he complained that Rav Bivi caused her death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Rav Bivi drinks beer, therefore his daughter [was dark and] needed plaster; we do not drink beer, our daughters do not need it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> It is to plaster Kilkul [R. Nechemyah says, it is to plaster Andifi].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are Kilkul and Andifi?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> They are the temple and the area underneath (or a strip to the side of) it, respectively.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah's Shi'ur is bigger [than R. Nechemyah's] - elsewhere, Chachamim's Shi'ur is bigger (we assume that R. Nechemyah holds like Chachamim, who normally require a widespread use)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah's Shi'ur is less than that of Chachamim, it is bigger than that of R. Nechemyah (he is concerned for uses even less common than R. Yehudah is concerned for).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (regarding Andifi - Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> I agree with R. Yehudah's opinion regarding Chavot (plaster dissolved in much water), and with R. Nechemyah's opinion regarding clumps of kneaded plaster.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chavot is used both for the temple and the area underneath it (but not clumps)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #2 (R. Yitzchak):</span> Andifi is a Kli with one opening above and one below (they are sealed with plaster; the plaster is removed when one wants to put in or take out wine).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This would be wasteful (the wine would dissolve the plaster, and leak out)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer #2 (R. Yitzchak):</span> Andifi is plaster put on other parts of the body to redden them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> One does not spend money to kill his daughter [like the Nochri killed his daughter]! (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Kahana):</span> Andifi are notches:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There were notches in the [Kli Shares that held a] Hin, to show how much [oil or wine] is needed for [Nesachim of a] bull, of a ram, and of a lamb (a half, third or quarter Hin, respectively).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> Andifi is plaster put on the forehead:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Galilean came to Bavel; he was asked to expound about [Yechezkeil's vision of] the Merkavah (Hash-m's chariot). He repeated what R. Nechemyah taught to his colleague - a wasp emerged from the wall and stung him on the Andifi (forehead), killing him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>People said that he caused his own death (Chagigah 11B - one may expound about the Merkavah only to one Chacham [at a time who need not hear details, i.e. one] who understands [mostly] by himself).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE <i>SHI'UR</i> OF <i>HOTZA'AH</i> FOR SAND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> The Shi'ur for clay is to make a signet on a big merchandise sack;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, it is to make a signet on a letter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Akiva says, the Shi'ur for manure or fine sand is enough to fertilize a stalk of cabbage;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim say, it is enough to fertilize a leek stalk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The Shi'ur for coarse sand is to put on a spoon of plaster (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The Shi'ur for a reed is to make a quill;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was thick or cracked [and not fit for a quill], the Shi'ur is [to be fuel] to cook a light egg, mixed in a frying pan (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> ...On a spoon of plaster.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This means, on a plasterer's trowel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is our Tana, who says that sand is good for plaster?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> It is R. Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> [On account of mourning over the Churban] one may not plaster his house unless he mixed in sand or straw.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, if he mixed in straw, it is permitted; if he mixed in sand, this is Trachsid (cement, it is better than regular plaster), it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> It is even like Chachamim - because they hold that it is bad for (darkens) plaster, this permits [one to plaster his house with it].</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE <i>SHI'UR</i> OF <i>HOTZA'AH</i> FOR A REED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur for a reed is to make a quill.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It must reach to the knuckles [to be suitable for writing].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Does this refer to the top knuckles or the knuckles below them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it was thick...[the Shi'ur is to cook a light egg, mixed in a frying pan].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It is mixed with oil (this speeds cooking) in a frying pan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar brei d'Rav Ashi):</span> Did you hear what is 'a light egg'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (His son):</span> It is the egg of Tziltzalta (a small bird, in the Tor (pigeon) family).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Mar brei d'Rav Ashi):</span> Presumably, this is because it is small - if so, you should say a hummingbird (it is even smaller)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>His son could not answer; he asked his father if he had heard an answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mar brei d'Rav Ashi citing Rav Sheshes):</span> It is a hen's egg.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it called a light egg?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It cooks the fastest of all eggs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (his son):</span> Every other Shi'ur for food for Shabbos is k'Grogeres - why is this different?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar brei d'Rav Ashi citing Rav Nachman):</span> Also here, the Shi'ur is k'Grogeres of a light egg.</p>
