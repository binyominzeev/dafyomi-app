<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina - Mishnah):</span> If one who is Tamei Mes squeezed exactly k'Beitzah of olives or grapes, they are Tehorim (they are not Huchshar until there is liquid - at that time, there is less than k'Beitzah of solid food, it is too small to Metamei the liquid (Rashi; alternatively, k'Beitzah is needed to Mekabel Hechsher or Tum'ah - Tosfos 91A)).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he squeezed more than k'Beitzah, they are Teme'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(The Mishnah did not specify, presumably it applies even if he squeezed into food.) If a liquid that comes to a solid is a solid, what is Machshir?</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah):</span> Tana'im argue about this:</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, they are Huchshar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Chachamim hold that liquid that comes to a solid is a solid (therefore it is not Machshir), R. Yehudah holds that it is a liquid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> No, all agree that it is a liquid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about a liquid that goes to waste - R. Yehudah holds that it is a liquid, Chachamim hold that it is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>These same Tana'im argue similarly in another Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one bruises olives [to soften them] with Tamei hands, they are Huchshar (the liquid is beneficial); if he does so to salt them, they are not Huchshar (he does not want the liquid).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If he checks to see if it is time to harvest them, they are not Huchshar;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>R. Yehudah says, they are Huchshar.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue about a liquid that goes to waste - R. Yehudah holds that it is a liquid, Chachamim hold that it is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Indeed, the Tana'im in this Beraisa argue about a liquid that goes to waste - but the argument in the above Mishnah is about a liquid used to lubricate a food.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Asi):</span> This is because they are poor (this is the only time they cease working and enjoy good food).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R.
