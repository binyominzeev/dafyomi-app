<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Objection #4:</span> [Perhaps] one may go out with a Kemi'a only if it is covered with leather (for then, one may enter a Beis ha'Kisei with it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Tefilin are covered with leather, yet one may not enter a Beis ha'Kisei with them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who enters a Beis ha'Kisei removes his Tefilin four Amos before the Beis ha'Kisei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One may not enter a Beis ha'Kisei with [head] Tefilin on account of the Shin (a letter of Hash-m's name 'Shakai', which is not covered):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> A tradition from Moshe from Sinai mandates a [protrusion on the box of the head Tefilin shaped like a] Shin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> A tradition from Sinai mandates [making the knot in the strap of the head Tefilin to form] a 'Dalet'. (Tosfos deletes this and the next teaching from the text, because the Gemara (28B) learned that the boxes must be from a Kosher animal from the fact that the Shin is written from the box itself, but it needed a different source for the straps. Rashba (28B) disagrees - even though tradition requires the Dalet and Yud, they are mere knots, not writing.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> A tradition from Sinai mandates (Rashi - making the knot in the strap of the head Tefilin to form) a 'Yud'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>(Objection #4 stands; we do not resolve whether or not an uncovered Kemi'a may be taken into a Beis ha'Kisei.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THINGS FORBIDDEN TO GO OUT WITH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not go out with Shiryon, Kasda or Magafayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Shiryon is armor;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Kasda is a cap worn under a helmet; Magafayim are iron boots.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> A woman may not go out wearing the following; if she did, she is Chayeves Chatas:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A needle with a hole, a ring with a stamp, Kuliyar, Koveles (these will be explained), or a flask of [fragrant] balsam oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Chachamim exempt regarding Koveles or a flask of balsam oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Ula):</span> The law of a man is opposite [regarding a ring, he is liable only for a ring without a stamp].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Ula holds that anything fitting for a man (it is a garment or Tachshit for him) is not fitting for a woman (it is a load for her), and vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> Shepherds may go out in Sak (sackcloth);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Anyone is allowed - [Chachamim mentioned shepherds because] it is common for them to go out with Sak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Ula holds that women are a nation unto themselves (utterly different from men - but anything fitting for some men [or women] is fitting for anyone [of that gender]).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> If one finds Tefilin [in a place where they are prone to be disgraced], he brings them into the city [by wearing them] one pair at a time, whether the finder is a man or woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Women cannot be a nation unto themselves [for then they could not wear Tefilin just because it is fitting for men, it would be a load for them]! Tefilin are not intrinsically fitting for women, since it is Mitzvas Ase sheha'Zeman Grama (a positive Mitzvah that applies only at certain times), they are exempt from such Mitzvos,</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir holds that [the Mitzvah of] Tefilin applies at night and on Shabbos, therefore it is she'Lo ha'Zeman Grama, such Mitzvos apply to women.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is one liable for wearing a ring [that is not fitting] - this is not the normal way to carry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmeyah):</span> The Mishnah discusses a female Gizbar (treasurer, it is normal for her to wear a ring with a stamp).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection: (Rabah):</span> You explain how a woman is liable for a ring with a stamp, but not how a man is liable for a ring without a stamp!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Sometimes each wears a ring normally worn by the other gender, i.e. a man gives his ring to his wife to put away, she wears it home; a woman gives her ring to her husband to bring to a repairman, he wears it on the way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [She may not go out with] Kuliyar or Koveles...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Kuliyar is a clasp worn around the neck (it passes through the openings of her garment to keep it closed - Rashi; Aruch - it is a crown).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>GOING OUT WITH FRAGRANCES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav and Rav Asi):</span> Koveles is spices bound together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Meir):</span> A woman may not go out with Koveles; if she did, she is Chayeves Chatas;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, she may not go out with it; if she did, she is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Eliezer permits her to go out with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir considers it a load;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim consider it a Tachshit - they forbid lest she will take it off to show it, and come to carry it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer also considers it a Tachshit - he is not concerned lest she show it off, for it is worn to cover up body odor, she does not want people to know that she needs it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2 - R. Eliezer):</span> She is exempt for Koveles or a flask of balsam oil (this implies that he forbids)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> In Beraisa #1, R. Eliezer responds to Chachamim, who forbid and exempt b'Diavad - therefore, he says that she is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In Beraisa #2, R. Eliezer responds to R. Meir, who obligates - therefore, he says 'She is exempt' for parallel structure.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">62b----------------------------------------62b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where do we find that R. Eliezer responds to R. Meir?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A woman may not go out with a key in her hand; if she did, she is Chayeves Chatas;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Eliezer exempts for Koveles or a flask of balsam oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> R. Meir did not discuss Koveles!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is abbreviated, it means as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Meir also forbids her to go out with Koveles or a flask of balsam oil; if she did, she is Chayeves Chatas;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Eliezer exempts for Koveles or a flask of balsam oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa):</span> R. Eliezer exempts if there are spices in the Koveles - but if it is empty, she is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Inference (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> This teaches that if someone was Motzi (took from Reshus ha'Yachid to Reshus ha'Rabim) food in a Kli, and the food was less than the Shi'ur to be Chayav, he is liable for the Kli!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because a Koveles without spices has just a remnant of fragrance, this is like less than a Shi'ur of food!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> Perhaps one who was Motzi food less than a Shi'ur in a Kli is exempt, because the Kli is Batul to the food - but Koveles cannot be Batul to a remnant of fragrance, since smell has no substance!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CONDUCT THAT CAUSED THE CHURBAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "V'Reishis Shemanim Yimshachu" - this refers to balsam (the choicest oil).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> R. Yehudah ben Bava decreed even against balsam oil [after the Churban] - Chachamim did not agree;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is for indulgence, Chachamim would have agreed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Abaye):</span> You assume that every matter of indulgence was forbidden - this is not so!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami or R. Asi):</span> "Ha'Shosim b'Mizrekei Yayin" - this is Kenishkin (a Kli with two [or more] mouths, enabling people to drink together; alternatively, wine is thrown from one end to the other when it is tilted);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(The other of R. Ami and R. Asi):</span> They used to throw their cups one to another [when drinking; Rashi - they would juggle them].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Nevertheless, Rabah bar Rav Huna saw the Reish Galusa drink from Kenishkin, and he did not comment (this shows that it was not forbidden)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions (Abaye):</span> Rather, Chachamim only decreed against indulgence which also brings Simchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> "Ha'Shochvim Al Mitos Shen u'Sruchim Al Arsosam" - they would urinate naked in front of their beds (they would not bother to go outside).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Avahu):</span> We cannot say that for this "Yiglu b'Rosh Golim (they will be the first to be exiled)"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Rather, they would eat and drink together, stick their beds together and swap wives; making their beds stink with others' semen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Three things cause poverty - urinating in front of one's bed while naked, disgracing Netilas Yadayim (washing the hands before eating) and making his wife curse him in his presence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Urinating in front of one's bed while naked is problematic only if he faces the bed - if he turns away, it is fine;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even facing the bed is problematic only if he urinates on the ground - if he urinates into a Kli, it is fine;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Disgracing Netilas Yadayim is problematic only if he did not wash at all - if he washed minimally, it is fine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is wrong!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> I pour generous handfuls over my hands, and Hash-m fills my handfuls with goodness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> 'Making his wife curse him in his presence' refers to one who does not give her money for cosmetics;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is problematic only if he has money but refuses to give to her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rava brei d'Rav Ilai):</span> "Ya'an Ki Gavhu Benos Tziyon" - they (married women) would walk erect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Va'Telachnah Netuyos Garon" - they walked heel to toe [tiny steps, like one who sticks out his neck and faces up and cannot see where he walks; this was to allow men more time to look at them];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"U'Meshakros Einayim" - they would paint their eyes and wink [at single men];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Haloch v'Tafof" - a tall woman would walk next to a short woman [to make a more impressive appearance];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>(Rav Yitzchak d'vei R. Ami):"Uv'Ragleihem <i>Te'akasnah</i>" - they would put fragrances in their shoes, and kick the ground near unmarried men, spraying the scent to arouse their lust like the venom in Ka'os (an angry snake).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How were these women punished?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Ula):</span> "V'Hayah Sachas Bosem Mak Yihyeh" - the place where they would perfume themselves will melt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Sachas Chagurah Nikpah" - where they would gird themselves with pretty belts, it will be full of wounds;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"V'Sachas Ma'aseh Mikshah Karchah" - where they would adorn their hair, it will be full of bald patches;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"V'Sachas Pesigil Machagores Sak" - their openings (Ervah) that led to joy will be girded with sackcloth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Ki Sachas Yofi" - in place of beauty will be pus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> "<i>V'Sipach</i> Hash-m Kodkod Benos Tziyon" - they were stricken by Tzara'as, about which it says "...Vela'Sapachas".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rav or Shmuel):</span> "Va'Shem Pasehen Ye'areh" - blood [of Zivah] poured out of their openings;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav and Shmuel):</span> Their openings became like a Ya'ar (forest, i.e. full of hair and hence despised for relations).</p>
