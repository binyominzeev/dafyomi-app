<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>OIL LEFT IN A LAMP</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not benefit from the oil, for it is Muktzeh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> Leftover oil in a Ner or bowl [that was burning when Shabbos began] is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon permits it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHICH LAMPS ARE MUKTZEH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may move a new [earthenware] Ner (Hagahos Ashri - if one needs it for a permitted use, or needs its place), but not a used Ner (after one use it is repulsive, it is Muktzeh Machmas Mi'us);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon permits moving any Ner, except for one burning on Shabbos (for doing so extinguishes; alternatively, it is a Basis (something that supports Muktzeh, it itself is forbidden like Muktzeh) for the flame).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Yehudah):</span> One may move a new Ner, but not a used Ner;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Meir permits moving any Ner, except for one that was burning on Shabbos (it is Muktzeh Machmas Isur - since it was Asur to move it while it burned, it is forbidden for all of Shabbos);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Shimon permits any Ner, except for one burning on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If it extinguished, one may move it - but one may not move a cup, bowl or lantern [in which a light was burning, even after it extinguished].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon permits taking oil from a lamp that extinguished (Rashi - is about to go out), or from dripping oil, even from a burning lamp.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon holds like his father in one respect, and argues about another:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He permits Muktzeh, like his father;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>His father permits taking oil from a lamp only after it extinguished, he permits [Tosfos Rosh - what drips] from a burning lamp (Rashi - from the lamp itself, if it is extinguishing).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> But one may not move a cup, bowl or lantern.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are these different than a lamp?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula):</span> This clause is according to R. Yehudah [who forbids even a lamp].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Mar Zutra):</span> If so, it should not say 'but'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mar Zutra):</span> It is like R. Shimon - he permits a lamp, for it holds little oil, one anticipates moving it [after it goes out on Shabbos] - a cup, bowl or lantern holds much oil (one expects it to burn all Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1):</span> Leftover oil in a Ner or bowl [that was burning when Shabbos began] is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon permits it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Presumably, Beraisa #1 discusses a small bowl, for it is taught together with a lamp; Beraisa #2 discusses a large bowl, for it is taught together with a cup.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> If a Pamut (Menorah (candelabra) of metal; Aruch - it has only one Ner) burned on Shabbos [and went out - it is not Mi'us, it is an issue of Muktzeh Machmas Isur]:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi:</span> The opinion (R. Meir) that permits [above, a used Cheres lamp, i.e. Muktzeh Machmas Mi'us] forbids [here]; the opinion (R. Yehudah) that forbids [above] permits [here].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos:</span> The opinion (R. Shimon) that permits [above] forbids [here, for the Pamut is big]; the opinion (R. Yehudah and R. Meir) that forbids [above] permits [here],</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Every metal Ner is permitted, except for one that burned on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, R. Zeira taught that if a Pamut burned on Shabbos, all forbid [moving it]; if it did not burn on Shabbos, all permit;</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MUKTZEH MACHMAS ISUR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If a bed was designated for coins, one may not move it [on Shabbos].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak - Mishnah):</span> One may move a new Ner, but not a used Ner.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">44b----------------------------------------44b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Ner is made for lighting, yet one may move it before lighting in it - a bed is not made for coins, all the more so it is permitted before it was used for coins!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if a bed was designated for coins and one put coins on it, one may not move it; if he did not put coins on it, one may move it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was not designated for coins, if there are coins on it, one may not move it; if not, one may move it, as long as there were not coins on it [all of] Bein ha'Shemashos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar - Mishnah):</span> If the Ofan of a Sheidah (Rashi - wheel of a wagon; R. Tam - the base of a chest) comes off [easily]:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is not considered attached (it and the Sheidah are distinct Kelim - if Tum'ah touched one, the other is Tahor);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is not measured with it [regarding Tum'ah - a wooden Kli of 40 Sa'im (volume) is Tahor);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It does not shield from Tum'as Mes with it (the Sheidah is an Ohel that suppresses Tum'ah underneath it, but Tum'ah breaks through the Ofan and goes up);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>One may not drag it on Shabbos when there are coins on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> One may drag it when there are no coins on it, even if there were coins on it Bein ha'Shemashos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is like R. Shimon, who permits Muktzeh; Rav holds like R. Yehudah.</p>
