<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT HILLEL AND SHAMAI ARGUED ABOUT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> There was an argument about all 18 things decreed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> They agreed about everything.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> On that day (of the vote) they argued, on the morrow [Beis Hillel retracted and] they agreed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Hillel and Shamai argued about three things:</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Argument #1) (Mishnah - Shamai):</span> One must separate Chalah from a dough of at least a Kav of flour;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Hillel says, [a dough of at least] two Kavim is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Chachamim say, one and a half Kavim are liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>After measures were increased, one and a quarter [of the new] Kavim are liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Yosi says, one and a quarter Kavim are exempt, more than this is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Argument #2) (Mishnah - Hillel):</span> A Hin (12 Lugim) of Mayim She'uvim is Posel a Mikvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>[Normally, Chachamim discuss Lugim] - Hillel said 'Hin', for one must repeat exactly what he heard from his Rebbi;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Shamai says, nine Kavim (#2) is Posel;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Chachamim say, neither of these is correct, but they did not know the Shi'ur until two weavers from Sha'ar ha'Ashpah testified in the in the name of Shemayah and Avtalyon that the Shi'ur is three Lugim - the testimony was accepted. (Their profession and residence were recorded to teach that no one should shy away from the Beis Medrash - people of a lowly profession from a lowly place established the Halachah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Argument #3) (Mishnah - Shamai):</span> If any woman sees that she became Nidah, Dayah Sha'atah (she is Teme'ah from now and onwards, not retroactively);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Hillel says, she is retroactively Teme'ah from her last Bedikah (when she checked herself and found herself to be Tehorah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Chachamim say, she is never retroactively Teme'ah for more than 24 hours; if her last Bedikah was in the last 24 hours, she is retroactively Teme'ah from then.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Questions:</span> They argued about other things!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Mishnah - Hillel):</span> We do Semichah on Nedarim and Nedavos on Yom Tov;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shamai says, we do not Somech on Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Huna only lists arguments that started with Hillel and Shamai (the previous Nesi'im and Avos Beis Din argued about Semichah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Beraisa -Shamai):</span> If one harvests grapes in order to make wine, the juice that drips from them is Machshir them (for he wants the juice to exude);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Hillel says, it is not Machshir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is not counted, for Hillel later agreed to Shamai.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE DECREES OF TUM'AS CHUTZ LA'ARETZ</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Yosi ben Yo'ezer and Yosi ben Yochanan decreed Tum'ah on Chutz la'Aretz and on glass vessels;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This was decreed by Chachamim 80 years before the Churban (long after Yosi and Yosi)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> The evil kingdom (Romi) started to conquer Eretz Yisrael 180 years before the Churban;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They decreed Tum'ah on Chutz la'Aretz and on glass vessels 80 years before the Churban;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Forty years before the Churban, the Great Sanhedrin exiled itself to Chanuyos (a place in Har ha'Bayis).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer: (Rav Yitzchak bar Avdimi):</span> After they exiled themselves, fines were not enforced.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That cannot be! (Fines do not depend on the Sanhedrin sitting in its place; also, Rav Yehudah taught that [after the Churban] R. Yehudah ben Bava gave Semichah to five Chachamim, enabling the continuation of collection of fines!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Rather, after they exiled themselves, capital punishment was not enforced.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Yosi ben Yo'ezer and Yosi ben Yochanan lived [and made their decrees] 80 years before the Churban!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> The Nesi'im during the last 100 years before the Churban were Hillel, Shimon, Gamliel [ha'Zaken], and Shimon (the father of R. Gamliel who was Nasi in Yavneh);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Yosi and Yosi were long before Hillel!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">15b----------------------------------------15b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, Yosi and Yosi decreed Tum'ah on dirt of Chutz la'Aretz and to burn Terumah that become Tamei on account of it - they did not decree about the airspace of Chutz la'Aretz;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim 80 years before the Churban decreed Tum'ah on the airspace of Chutz la'Aretz, and to Toleh Terumah that become Tamei on account of it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The first decree [about Tum'as Chutz la'Aretz for which we burn Terumah] was to burn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> But Ilfa taught that the initial decree regarding [Terumah that touched Stam] hands was to burn it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The first decree of other things was not to burn!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, Yosi and Yosi decreed to Toleh on account of dirt of Chutz la'Aretz, they did not decree on the airspace;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim 80 years before the Churban decreed to burn on account of the dirt, and to Toleh on account of the airspace.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The decree was made [later,] in Usha!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are six cases in which we burn Terumah on account of a doubt - if it became Tamei through a Beis ha'Peras (a field in which a grave was plowed or lost), through dirt from Chutz la'Aretz, through clothes of an ignoramus (someone not careful about Tum'ah), through Kelim that are found, through spit (perhaps it is from a Zav), and through urine, even if it could be of an animal (and even if it is a person's, perhaps the person was Tahor).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>For Vadai Maga (something definitely touched one of these), even though the Tum'ah is Safek, we burn Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yosi says, in Reshus ha'Yachid, we burn even for Safek Maga;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Chachamim say, in Reshus ha'Yachid we Toleh for Safek Maga; in Reshus ha'Rabim, it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> These six Sefekos were enacted in Usha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, Yosi and Yosi decreed to Toleh on account of dirt of Chutz la'Aretz, they did not decree on the airspace;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim 80 years before the Churban decreed to Toleh also on account of the airspace;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In Usha they decreed to burn on account of the dirt, they left the decree to Toleh on account of airspace as it was.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>TUM'AH</i> OF GLASS VESSELS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did they decree Tum'ah on glass vessels?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> Because they are made from sand, Chachamim made them like Klei Cheres (earthenware vessels).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But immersion in a Mikvah is Metaher them [unlike Klei Cheres]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are a Chatzizah (blockage) that invalidate immersion - pitch and Mor (myrrh (a spice) or sap) on glass vessels...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Immersion does not Metaher vessels or pure glass - the Mishnah discusses vessels that were punctured and sealed with a drop of molten lead;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is like R. Meir, who says a vessel gets the law of its Ma'amid (what makes it usable) - immersion is Metaher metal vessels.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> If a glass vessel was punctured and sealed with a drop of molten lead, R. Meir is Metamei, Chachamim Metaher.</p>
