<p class="dedicationbox">12TH CYCLE SHABBOS 146 (21 Elul) - dedicated l'Iluy Nishmat Rav Chaim ben Esther Bitton, in honor of the day of his Petirah, by his grandson Dr. Alain Bitton of Geneva, Switzerland. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN THE FILTH DEPARTED FROM YISRAEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (4:g) - R. Yochanan):</span> Nochrim reek because they did not stand on Har Sinai;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Nachash had relations with Chavah, and cast filth (Nefesh ha'Chayim, brought in Etz Yosef - a mixture of evil into her deeds) into her; Yisrael was cleansed of the filth [and all blemishes] on Sinai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> Why don't converts reek?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Even though they did not stand on Sinai, their Mazel stood on Sinai - "Es Asher Yeshno Po Imanu ha'Yom Lifnei Hash-m Elokeinu v'Es Asher Einenu Po Imanu ha'Yom".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>He argues with R. Aba bar Kahana:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Kahana):</span> The filth did not leave our ancestors until three generations - Avraham fathered Yishmael, and Yitzchak fathered Esav, Yakov fathered 12 flawless Shevatim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OPENING A BARREL ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may break a barrel to eat the dry figs inside, as long as he does not intend to make a Kli (i.e. a nice opening);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, one may not puncture the cork of a barrel;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim permit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>One may not puncture it from the side (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yehudah says, a case occurred - R. Yochanan ben Zakai said that he suspects that he is Chayav Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Oshaya):</span> One may break the barrel only if the figs are pressed into a ring (since he needs a sword to cut the figs, he may also use it to break the barrel), not if the figs are loose.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> One may bring a barrel of wine, slice off the top with a sword and leave it in front of guests on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon hold like Chachamim, our Mishnah is like R. Nechemyah [who permits moving a Kli only for its intended purpose].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What forced R. Oshaya to establish our Mishnah to discuss a ring, like R. Nechemyah - he should say that it [even] discusses loose figs, like Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava) Question:</span> The Mishnah should have said that there is fruit inside - why did it specify dry figs?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that the figs are pressed into a ring.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> One may open (untie the rope sealing) a basket of figs or dates, or unravel [the rope with a Kli] or cut it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> One may open, one may not unravel or cut.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Beraisa #1 is Chachamim, Beraisa #2 is R. Nechemyah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nechemyah):</span> Even a ladle, Talis or knife may be moved only for its intended purpose.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May one pierce [the side of] a barrel with a spear on Shabbos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps he intends to make a [nice] opening - if so, it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he intends to be generous (so much will flow out) - if so, it is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> He intends for an opening, so it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> One may bring a barrel of wine, slice off the top with a sword and leave it in front of guests on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, surely he intends to be generous; here, if he wanted to be generous, he would have opened it (removed the cork)!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PUNCTURING A CORK OR BARREL ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> One may not puncture the cork...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> They argue about puncturing the top of the cork (this is abnormal) - but all forbid puncturing the side;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> One may not puncture <i>it</i> from the side.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This refers to the cork (all agree to this).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> They argue about puncturing the side of the cork, but all permit puncturing the top.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Seifa forbids puncturing <i>the barrel</i> from the side.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not make a new hole [in a Kli] on Shabbos; he may widen a hole.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Some forbid to widen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>All agree that he may open an old hole that was sealed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Presumably, the first Tana forbids making a new hole because this is Tikun (the final Melachah) - also widening a hole is Metaken it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Mid'Oraisa, one is not liable for a hole unless it is made for entrance <i>and</i> exit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim decreed to forbid [a hole made for one of these] on account of a hole in a chicken coop, which lets in air and lets out heat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He may widen a hole.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>We are not concerned lest one widen a hole in a chicken coop - he would not, lest a Sheretz enter [and kill chickens].</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">146b----------------------------------------146b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Some forbid to widen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>This is because sometimes it was made too small, and he needs to widen it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows the opinion that forbids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> All agree that he may open an old hole that was sealed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This is permitted only if it was sealed [in a place] where this preserves [the smell of] the wine, it is forbidden in a place that strengthens the barrel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which place preserves, and which strengthens?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> Above the level of the wine preserves, below this strengthens.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Also below the level of the wine preserves;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Below the level of the dregs preserves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rava - Abaye - Beraisa):</span> (When dividing a Chatzer, the four Amos outside every opening of a house [to the Chatzer] are given to its owner, the rest is divided equally. Even) if a house (i.e. its opening) was sealed, it receives four Amos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the doorposts were removed [and then it was sealed], it does not receive four Amos. (This [and also the following law of Tum'ah] shows that until an opening is utterly sealed, it is still considered an opening.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> If Tum'as Mes is inside a sealed house, it is not Metamei outside [the surrounding four Amos];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If the doorposts were removed [before sealing it, it is like a sealed coffin, mid'Rabanan] it is Metamei outside.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Shimshon):</span> If Tum'as Mes is inside a sealed house, it is not Metamei outside [under ledges that protrude, for we assume that [they will break the opening and] the Mes will leave through the opening, and not under the ledges];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>If the doorposts were removed it is Metamei outside (the Mes might leave anywhere, including under the ledges).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>STRINGENCIES OF RAV</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> It is forbidden to insert a hollow reed into a hole in a barrel [so wine will leave through it];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>All forbid to cut the reed [to the right size] on Shabbos; if a reed fell out, all permit to return it; they argue about a reed that was cut, but was not placed in the hole [to see if it is the right size];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav forbids, lest he will cut it to size; Shmuel does not decree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Tana'im argue as Rav and Shmuel argue:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not cut a [reed to make a] tube on Yom Tov, there is no need to say it is forbidden on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it fell out, one may return it on Shabbos, there is no need to say it is permitted on Yom Tov;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yoshiyah is lenient.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Yoshiyah argue with the Reisha or the Seifa?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Surely he does not permit in the Reisha - he makes a Kli!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He argues in the Seifa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The first Tana also permits in the Seifa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about a tube that was cut, but was not placed in the hole [to see if it is the right size] - the first Tana forbids, lest he will cut it to size; R. Yoshiyah does not decree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yoshiyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it was punctured [one may not put wax on it...]</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> It is forbidden to put oil on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav decrees to forbid oil, lest one put wax; Shmuel does not decree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rav Shmuel bar Rav Chanah (to Rav Yosef):</span> You explicitly said that Rav permits oil!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Tavos Rishba):</span> One may not put a myrtle leaf in a hole in a barrel in order that the wine flow through it (like a spout).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yemar mi'Difti):</span> This is a decree lest one make a gutter pipe (Rashi; Tosfos - lest one attach it to the roof);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> It is a decree lest he cut [a leaf off the branch, making a Kli].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these answers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the leaf is already cut [Rav Ashi permits, Rav Yemar forbids].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One may not go in Reshus ha'Rabim 'wearing' felt pillows or blankets;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All permit if they are soft (they are clothing); all forbid if they are hard;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue when they are intermediate - Rav holds that it looks like a load, Shmuel says that it does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>Rav did not explicitly forbid, it was inferred from the following episode:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav visited a certain place, there was not enough room for the Talmidim. He went to a Karmelis; someone brought felt pillows or blankets to him by wearing it - Rav did not sit on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The one who saw this assumed that this is because Rav forbids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> The onlooker erred - Rav announced that it is permitted! He did not sit on them on account of the honor of Rav Kahana and Rav Asi (Talmidei Chaverim of Rav who had to sit on the ground).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THINGS WE DO NOT DECREE AGAINST ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may put a Tavshil in a pit [on Shabbos] so it will not spoil [in the sun].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may put good (drinkable) water [in a Kli] in bad water to cool the good water;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One may put cold water in the sun to warm up.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If one's clothes became soaked in water on the road, he may continue, this is no problem;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When he reaches the outer gate [of the entrance to the city, a guarded place], he spreads them out to dry in the sun, but not in front of people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Objection:</span> Obviously, one may put a Tavshil in a pit!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that it is forbidden lest he even out holes in the ground - the Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may put good water in bad water</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is the Seifa - one may put cold water in the sun.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also this is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we decree to forbid, lest he store it in hot coals - the Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one's clothes became soaked...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Anything forbidden on account of Mar'is ha'Ayin (suspicion) is forbidden even in private.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> He spreads them out to dry in the sun, but not in front of people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about this (Rav holds like R. Eliezer and R. Shimon):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may spread them to dry in the sun, but not in public view;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer and R. Shimon forbid.</p>
