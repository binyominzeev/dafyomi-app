<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When they are wet [Hatmanah is forbidden].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are they forbidden (Rashi - only; Rambam - even) when they are naturally wet, or (Rashi - even; Rambam - only) if they are wet on account of outside moisture?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> ...Not in straw, grape skins or pits, tufts, and grass [when they are wet].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand that these can be wet on account of outside moisture - but tufts cannot be naturally wet!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Wool from between the thighs can be naturally wet [from sweat or urine].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Oshaya's Beraisa):</span> One may Matmin in dry clothing or produce, but not in wet clothing or produce.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Clothing cannot be naturally wet!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is made from wool from between the thighs.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OTHER MATERIALS FOR <i>HATMANAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may Matmin in clothing, produce, dove's wings (Rashash - feathers), sawdust and fine chaff of flax;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah forbids if it is fine, and permits if it is coarse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Yanai):</span> One must [be able to] guard his body to wear Tefilin, like 'Elisha of the wings'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> He must be able to guard himself from passing gas [while wearing Tefilin].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer #2 (Rava):</span> He need [only] be able to guard himself from sleeping [while wearing Tefilin, lest he pass gas - when awake, anyone can guard himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Answer #2 (Rava):</span> He must [also] be able to guard himself from sleeping (one must be conscious of Tefilin the entire time he wears them; also, lest he pass gas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he called 'Elisha of the wings'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Romi decreed to puncture the skull of anyone who will wear Tefilin; Elisha wore Tefilin in the market. An officer appointed to enforce the decree saw him and chased him; when he caught him, Elisha took the Tefilin from his head and put it in his hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The officer asked what he is holding; Elisha said that it is dove's wings - a miracle was done, he opened his hand and revealed dove's wings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is special about dove's wings more than those of other birds?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Keneses Yisrael is compared to a dove - "Kanfei Yonah Nechpah va'Kesef";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a dove's wings protect it [from cold, and it uses them to fight off attackers], Yisrael's Mitzvos protect them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Sawdust [and fine chaff of flax; R. Yehudah forbids if it is fine].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Yehudah [Maharsha - also] argue about sawdust, or [only] about chaff of flax?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Fine chaff of flax is like manure (it adds heat, one may not Matmin in it. Presumably, if he also argued about sawdust, the Beraisa would teach this.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ARE SKINS <i>MUKTZEH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Hatmanah is permitted in skins, one may move them;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Hatmanah is permitted in wool shearings, one may not move them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How may one take the food [since it is forbidden to move the wool]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One lifts the cover [of the pot with the wool on it], the wool falls [to the side].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Elazar ben Azaryah says, one tilts the box [in which Hatmanah was done] and takes from the pot, lest he remove the pot, the pit (in which it was Tamun) will cave in and it will be forbidden to return the pot;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Chachamim say, he takes [the pot] and returns it (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>(Gemara - R. Yonason, R. Yonason and R. Chanina) Question: Does the Mishnah discuss skins of a Ba'al ha'Bayis (they may be moved, for they can be used to lie on), but those of a tanner are forbidden (he would not lie on them, lest they get dirty);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, perhaps it permits skins of a tanner, all the more so those of a Ba'al ha'Bayis!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yonason ben Elazar):</span> It discusses skins of a Ba'al ha'Bayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chanina bar Chama):</span> R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi said that his father was a tanner, yet he would lie on skins [on Shabbos; Rashi - on a weekday].</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (against R. Chanina - Beraisa):</span> One may move boards of a Ba'al ha'Bayis, but not of a craftsman;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one intended to use them to serve bread to guests, it is permitted in either case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Boards are different, people are particular that they not get ruined.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (against R. Chanina - Beraisa):</span> One may move skins whether or not they were tanned - we distinguish them only regarding Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This applies both to skins of a Ba'al ha'Bayis and of a tanner!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it applies only to skins of a Ba'al ha'Bayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so (one may not move a tanner's tanned skins), the Beraisa should have distinguished between skins of a tanner!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses only skins of a Ba'al ha'Bayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Tana'im argue about this [moving a tanner's tanned skins]:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may move skins of a Ba'al ha'Bayis, but not of a tanner;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi permits moving both of them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE SOURCE THAT THERE ARE 39 <i>MELACHOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Question (R. Yonason, R. Yonason and R. Chanina) A Mishnah (73A) teaches that there are 39 Melachos - how did the Tana know this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chanina bar Chama):</span> He learns from the labors used to build the Mishkan (39 primary labors were done);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yonason ben Elazar):</span> He learns from 39 occurrences of the word 'Melachah' [or Meleches or Melachto] in the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> Is "Va'Yavo ha'Baysah La'asos Melachto" [regarding Yosef] among the 39?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Let us bring a Sefer Torah and count them! Rabah bar bar Chanah said that a case occurred, they took out a Sefer Torah and counted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> I know how many times it says Melachah (R. Chananel - there are 61 in all - 38 of them are surely counted; 21 of them are surely excluded, e.g. those commanding to do Melachah or those forbidding Meleches Avodah)! The question is whether the 39th is this verse or another verse:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we count "Veha'Melachah Haysah Dayam" (it means, they finished the work), we exclude "Va'Yavo ha'Baysah...", like the opinion that Yosef wanted to be with Potifar's wife (until the image of Yakov deterred him - 'Melachto' is a euphemism);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If we exclude "Veha'Melachah Haysah Dayam" (it means, enough donations were given for the Mishkan), we include "Va'Yavo ha'Baysah...", like the opinion that Yosef went to do his work.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Chanina - Beraisa):</span> One is liable only for Melachos resembling those done for the Mishkan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They planted and harvested - you may not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They passed boards from the ground to the wagons, and returned them to the ground - you may not transfer from Reshus ha'Rabim to Reshus ha'Yachid or vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>They passed boards from wagon to wagon - you may not transfer from one Reshus ha'Yachid to another.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is not a Melachah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye and Rava):</span> You may not transfer from one Reshus ha'Yachid to another if Reshus ha'Rabim is in the middle.</p>
