<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Noson bar Oshaya):</span> If one smoothes rocks, for which Av is he liable?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yochanan gestured to show Makeh b'Patish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Mishnah is Mechayev smoothing rocks <i>and</i> Makeh b'Patish!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means 'Smoothing rocks, which is liable for Makeh b'Patish.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If one drills any amount he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand this according to Rav - it looks like he drills for the sake of building. (Gilyonei ha'Shas - 'looks' is imprecise, it is actual building. <b>PF</b> - perhaps because it looks like it is for building, he is liable even without this intent, for it is Melachah she'Einah Tzerichah l'Gufah - but something that does not look like it is done with intent for a Melachah is not Melachah she'Einah Tzerichah l'Gufah. A Mishnah (cited on 107A) is Mechayev for puncturing an abcess to make an opening (that will be permanent, or to also let in air) - nevertheless, Shmuel, who is Mechayev Melachah she'Einah Tzerichah l'Gufah (42A), permits puncturing just to let out pus.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But according to Shmuel, this is not the end of the Melachah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he drilled with an iron nail and left it inside [to hang things on] - this is a final Melachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The general rule is...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes one who hollowed out a receptacle to hold three Lugim in a block big enough to a make a receptacle for four Lugim (even though he will enlarge the hole later, he is liable because some people leave it like this).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> Even one who bangs a hammer on an anvil...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he liable?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> He trains his hand [to hit with the proper force].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Benei Rachbah):</span> If someone saw a craftsman on Shabbos and learned [from him], is he liable?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye and Rava):</span> People that beat [gold thinly] to make the plating for the Kerashim did so (after every few hits on the gold they would hit the anvil to smooth the hammer, lest it tear the gold).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> Even one who bangs a hammer on an anvil while making the Kli is liable, for people that beat the plating for the Mishkan did so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PLOWING AND PRUNING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur to be liable for plowing, weeding, pruning [dry branches] or pruning wet branches is any amount;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one gathered [detached] wood:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If this was to improve [the tree or ground], he is liable for any amount;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it was for fuel, the Shi'ur is to cook a light egg.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one gathered [detached] grass:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If this was to improve [the ground], he is liable for any amount;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it was for animals to eat, the Shi'ur is enough to fill a kid's mouth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What use is a tiny plowed area?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One can plant a gourd seed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Weeding, pruning dry or wet branches.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one detached endives or pruned [moist, edible] reeds:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was for people to eat, the Shi'ur is k'Grogeres; if it was for animals to eat, the Shi'ur is enough to fill a kid's mouth;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it was for fuel, the Shi'ur is to cook a light egg;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If it was to improve [the ground], he is liable for any amount.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In every case, he improves the ground!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> The Reisha discusses a swamp (there is no benefit from the improvement).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> It discusses even a field - the case is, he does not intend to improve it (therefore, he is not liable for improving).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Abaye and Rava both say that R. Shimon agrees about a Pesik Reisha (an inevitable consequence, it is as if he intended)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It discusses another's field (the one who pruned does not benefit. Tosfos - perhaps this is permitted only regarding a small improvement.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WRITING TWO LETTERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one writes two letters of any language he is liable, whether he used his right or left hand, whether he wrote the same letter twice or two different letters, even if he wrote two symbols (Rashba - e.g. an inverted 'Nun'; Rashi - even if he used two different inks).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi says, one is liable for two letters due to marking, so they would write [marks] on the Kerashim to know how to pair them up.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, we find [liability for] writing a small name when he intended to write a big name, e.g. he needed to write 'Shimon' or 'Shmuel' and he wrote 'Shem', or he wrote 'No'ach' in place of 'Nachor', or 'Dan' in place of 'Daniel', or 'Gad' in place of 'Gadiel'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> We understand why he is liable for writing with the right hand, it is the normal way to write;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why is he liable for writing with the left hand - this is abnormal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmiyah):</span> The Mishnah discusses a left-handed person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> His left hand is like a regular person's right hand - he should be liable for [writing with] his left hand, and exempt for his right!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah discusses an ambidextrous person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Yakov brah d'Vas Yakov):</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Yosi, who is Mechayev for two letters on account of marking (the left hand is fine for this).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since the Seifa is R. Yosi, the Reisha is not R. Yosi!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the Reisha and Seifa are both R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> We find...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [Why did R. Yehudah give only examples of different letters -] he holds that one is liable for the same letter twice!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> 'V'Asah Achas' - perhaps one is not liable until he writes the entire word, weaves the entire garment or makes the entire sieve [for which he intended]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Asah <i>me</i>'Achas" (he is liable even for part).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he is liable even for writing one letter, weaving one thread or making one Bayis (wrap around the lengthwise reeds) in a sieve!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">103b----------------------------------------103b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Achas" (a full Melachah) - he is liable for part of a big word only if it is a small word, e.g. Shem in place of Shimon ...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Yehudah says, even if he wrote two identical letters and they are a word he is liable, e.g. Shesh, Tes, Rar, Gag, Chach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Yosi says, he is not liable for writing, rather, for marking, for they would write letters on the Kerashim to know how to pair them up!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Therefore, if he made one scratch on two planks, or two scratches on one plank he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (R. Shimon):</span> 'V'Asah Achas' - perhaps one is liable only for the entire word, garment, or sieve!</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he is liable even for one letter, thread or Bayis!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Achas" - he is liable only for a permanent Melachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span>R. Yosi says, [we expound as if said] 'V'Asah Achas v'Asah Henah' - sometimes one is liable Achas (one Chatas) for many transgressions, sometimes he is liable Henah, a Chatas for each transgression.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> R. Yehudah is Mechayev even for two identical letters!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah himself is Mechayev only for different letters, in the Beraisa he teaches the opinion of his Rebbi:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah citing R. Gamliel):</span> Even if he wrote two identical letters and they are a word he is liable, e.g. Shesh, Tes, Rar, Gag, Chach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon does not argue with the first Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they argue about writing 'Aleph-Aleph' (which is not a word) from "A'azercha" - the first Tana exempts, and R. Shimon obligates, for it is used in Kemi'os!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That assumes that R. Shimon is more stringent [to Mechayev for less than the intended Melachah] - this is not so!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One is liable for any amount of drilling, scraping, tanning, or making any design on a Kli;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Shimon says, he is not liable unless he drills, scrapes, tans, or draws as much as he intended.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, R. Shimon teaches that he is not liable unless he writes the full word [intended].</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, the suggestion was to exempt until he writes the entire <i>verse</i> - "V'Asah me'Achas" teaches he is liable even for one word.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> 'V'Asah Achas v'Asah Henah' - sometimes one is liable Achas (once) for many transgressions, sometimes he is liable Henah, a Chatas for each transgression.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> He also expounds the 'Mem' in "me'Achas" and the 'Mem' in "me'Henah":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Achas is sometimes Henah (many Chata'os for one transgression), Henah is sometimes Achas (one Chatas for many transgressions);</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> We find [liability for] a small name from a big name...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he intended to write 'Shimon', he made an open (regular) 'Mem' - 'Shem' should have a closed (final) 'Mem'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> This teaches that if an open Mem was written in place of a closed Mem, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "U'Chsavtam" - the writing [of a Sefer Torah, Tefilin or Mezuzah] must be Tam (flawless); if any of the following were interchanged, it requires Genizah (Rashba - until it is fixed; Rivash (7) - l'Chatchilah, one may not fix a Sefer Torah with four errors on every Daf (Menachos 29b). We list pairs prone to be confused because they look (Rashi - or sound) similar):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Aleph and Ayin, Beis and Kaf, Gimel and Tzadi, Dalet and Reish, Hei and Ches, Vov and Yud, Zayin and (final) Nun, Tes and Pe, bent (regular) letters (Chaf, Nun, Pe or Tzadi) and the straight (final) forms of these, (final) Mem and Samech, closed Mem and open Mem;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If an open Parashah was written closed, or vice-versa; (An open Parashah is denoted by a Pe in printed Chumashim - in Seforim, the next Parashah begins on the next line; a closed Parashah is denoted by a Samech, spaces are left before the next Parashah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If [regular text] was written like Shirah (parts of the lines were left blank), or if [text that should be written] Shirah was written normally;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Chisda holds like the following Tana:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah ben Beseira):</span> (In Musaf of most days of Sukos, it says "V'Niskah" and "Ka'Mishpat".) On the second day it says "V'Niskeihem" (with an extra Mem), on day six it says "U'Nsacheha" (with an extra Yud), on day seven it says "K'Mishpatam";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The extra letters Mem, Yud, Mem spell Mayim, a hint to the Mitzvah to pour water on the Mizbe'ach on Sukos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He uses a final Mem (of "V'Niskeihem") in place of a regular Mem (in Mayim) - surely, he likewise holds that a regular Mem in place of a closed Mem is valid.</p>
