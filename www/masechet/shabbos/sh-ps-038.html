<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one forgot and left a pot on a Kirah and it cooked on Shabbos, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Chiya bar Aba did not answer; the next day, he expounded in public.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> If one cooks on Shabbos:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was Shogeg, he may eat the food; if he was Mezid, he may not eat it (if this is like R. Meir, he discusses eating the food on Shabbos; if it is like R. Yehudah, he discusses eating it after Shabbos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he did Shehiyah, there is no distinction (between Shogeg and Mezid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> In both cases, it is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who cooked b'Mezid may not eat it, for he did an action - one who did Shehiyah b'Mezid may eat it, for the cooking was not through an action;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> In both cases, it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who cooked b'Shogeg may eat it - we are not concerned lest a Yisrael cook on Shabbos, we need not decree on account of Mezid; Shehiyah is forbidden only mid'Rabanan, if it is permitted [b'Diavad] when one was Shogeg, people may come to do so b'Mezid and claim that it was b'Shogeg.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If one forgot and left a pot on a Kirah and it cooked on Shabbos:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was Shogeg, he may eat it; if he was Mezid, he may not eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This refers to partially cooked food - if it was fully cooked, in either case he may eat it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah says, water that was fully heated is permitted, for it is Mitztamek v'Ra Lo;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A Tavshil that was fully cooked is forbidden, for it is Mitztamek v'Yafeh Lo.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>This is not difficult for Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak - the Beraisa discusses before the decree (this will be explained), R. Chiya bar Aba's law applies after the decree;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>But according to Rabah and Rav Yosef - if R. Chiya's law is before the decree, it is difficult why he permits Mezid; if it after the decree, it is also difficult why he permits Shogeg!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was this decree?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yehudah bar Shmuel taught, at first, the Halachah was that if one cooked on Shabbos, he may eat it; if he was Mezid, he may not eat it; the same applies to one who was Meshaheh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Many people did Shehiyah b'Mezid and said that they were Shogeg, Chachamim decreed that even if one was b'Shogeg it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Contradictions:</span> R. Meir (in the Beraisa) contradicts what he said [in the Beraisa on 37A, that Beis Hillel permit only water, not a Tavshil], and so does R. Yehudah (there, he permitted Tavshil [Stam], he did not forbid Mitztamek v'Yafeh Lo)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> Here, R. Meir merely permits b'Diavad, he forbids l'Chatchilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 2:</span> There, R. Yehudah discusses a Kirah that was Garuf v'Katum - here he discusses one that was not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one transgressed Shehiyah, is the food forbidden? (Tosfos - above [on this Daf] we concluded that it is forbidden - that refers to food that was not k'Ma'achal Ben Drusai before Shabbos, now we ask about Shehiyah of Mitztamek v'Yafeh Lo b'Shogeg, according to R. Yehudah. Alternatively, we ask about Shogeg before the decree. Rosh - here, we ask if it is forbidden only to the Meshaheh, or to his entire family.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel bar Noson):</span> A case occurred, R. Yosi went to Tzipori and saw that Shehiyah of water and dried eggs was done on Kiros - he did not forbid the water, he forbade the eggs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He forbade them [b'Diavad] that very Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, he forbade them to do so l'Chatchilah the next Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that dried eggs are Mitztamek v'Yafeh Lo!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Affirmation:</span> Yes! Rav Chama bar Chanina said that he and Rebbi were once served dried eggs as small as sorb-apples, and they ate many!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CONDITIONS THAT ALLOW ONE TO RETURN A POT TO THE FIRE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Hillel):</span> One may return even a Tavshil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Tosfos - (Rav Sheshes):</span> According to the opinion that one may return, this is permitted [not only Erev Shabbos just before Shabbos, rather,] even on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rashi - (Rav Sheshes):</span> According to the opinion that one may return, this is permitted [not only at night, rather,] even on Shabbos [day - we do not say that surely it was removed without intent to return it]. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">38b----------------------------------------38b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Oshaya also permits returning on Shabbos:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Oshaya:</span> I was once in front of R. Chiya in the upper story - they brought a kettle of hot water from the ground floor, mixed a cup of wine for him, and returned the water [to the Kirah], he did not comment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Tadai):</span> One may return only if the pot is still in his hand, not if he put it on the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> That is Rav Tadai's opinion, but R. Chiya permits even if he put it on the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi or Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah):</span> R. Elazar permits only if the pot is still in his hand, not if he put it on the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Dimi and Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah):</span> R. Elazar permits even if he put it on the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Chizkiyah):</span> The Heter to return if it is still in his hand is only if he removed it with intent to return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he put it on the ground it is forbidden even if he intended to return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Chizkiyah):</span> The Isur to return if put it on the ground is only if he removed it without intent to return it.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Questions (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If he hung it on a stick, or put it on a bed, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> If he transferred the water from one pot to another, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>These questions are not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE LAWS OF A <i>TANUR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (A Tanur is an oven wide at the bottom and narrow on top, it retains heat better than a Kirah.) [Even] if a Tanur was heated with straw or stubble, one may not <i>put</i> in or on it (all explain this the same way they explained the Reisha (36B), i.e. Shehiyah or returning);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a Kupach (another kind of oven, it will be explained below) was heated with straw or stubble, its Halachah is like a Kirah; if it was heated with Gefes or wood, it is like a Tanur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yosef):</span> The Mishnah forbids only putting in or on a Tanur, but Semichah is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> If a Kupach was heated with straw or stubble, its Halachah is like a Kirah; if it was heated with Gefes or wood, it is [forbidden] like a Tanur.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Seifa had to equate it to a Tanur, for regarding a Kirah it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer A:</span> The Mishnah discusses putting on top of it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is not Garuf v'Katum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, even regarding a Kirah it is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer B:</span> The Mishnah discusses Semichah, and it equates a Kupach to a Tanur [to teach that it is forbidden]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and defense of Answer A, and Answer #2 to Question 3:i - Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> The Mishnah discusses a Kupach or Tanur that was Garuf v'Katum [and putting on top of it];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Seifa equates a Kupach to a Tanur - even if it is Garuf v'Katum, it is forbidden to put on it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is permitted on a Kirah that is Garuf v'Katum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Abaye - Beraisa):</span> If a Tanur was heated with straw or stubble, it is forbidden to Somech a pot near it, there is no need to say that one may not put a pot in it, there is no need to say that these are forbidden if it was heated with Gefes or wood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If a Kupach was heated with straw or stubble, Semichah is permitted, one may [not - some delete this from the text] put a pot in it; if it was heated with Gefes or wood, [even] Semichah is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> If a Kupach is like a Kirah, it should be so even if it was heated with Gefes or wood; if it is like a Tanur, it should be so even if it was heated with straw or stubble!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> It retains heat better than a Kirah, but not as well as a Tanur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between a Kupach and a Kirah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Only one pot can be placed on a Kupach (it is square), two pots fit on a Kirah (it is like a double Kupach).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> If a Kirah was split along its length, it is Tehorah (each half is too narrow to hold a standard pot); if it was split widthwise, it is Teme'ah (it is now like a Kupach);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>If a Kupach was split either way, it is Tehorah (it cannot hold a pot).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>COOKING WITH HOT ITEMS HEATED BY THE SUN OR BY FIRE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not put an egg near a [hot] kettle in order to roast (Chachmas Mano'ach - this is called Megalgel, for a cooked egg spins nicely);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may not wrap (Aruch; Rashi - crack an egg) in garments [heated in the sun, in order to roast];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi permits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>One may not Matmin an egg in sand or dust of the road in order to roast;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A case occurred, people in Tiverya brought a pipe of cold water through a hot spring (cold water constantly flowed through and became heated; alternatively, it emptied into the spring, heating the cold water and tempering the heat of the spring; alternatively, they put a Kli of cold water in the spring, to bathe on Shabbos in the Kli, they would open plugs, letting hot water into the Kli);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> If this was on Shabbos, it is considered water heated on Shabbos, one may not bathe in it or drink it; if it was on Yom Tov, it is considered water heated on Yom Tov, one may not bathe in it, one may drink it.</p>
