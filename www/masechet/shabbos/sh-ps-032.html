<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do they die specifically when giving birth?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> People run to slaughter a bull that it fell (it is the best opportunity - likewise, the time of birth is most opportune for a woman to die).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> A Shifchah gets beaten for all of her transgressions at once (similarly, a woman is punished for her sins together with fulfillment of Chavah's curse that birth will be painful).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Chisda):</span> One need not topple a drunkard (he will fall by himself - similarly, a fetus is primed to kill a pregnant woman, if Hash-m will not save her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Mar Ukva):</span> A lame shepherd cannot hit healthy goats [that deserve to be hit], they will receive their lashes in the pen - likewise, often a healthy woman has merits that do not allow the Satan to prosecute, but when she needs a miracle to give birth, he can prosecute).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rav Papa):</span> There is brotherhood in a place of wealth, but not in a place of poverty (likewise, when a woman is in danger [on account of birth], her advocates abandon her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When are men judged?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> They are judged when they pass over a bridge.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this the only time?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are judged when they pass over a bridge, or anything similar (any place of danger).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Rav would not go [across a river] on a ferry with a Nochri, lest the Nochri is due to be punished, and Rav will be punished with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Shmuel would go on a ferry only with a Nochri - he holds that the Satan does not rule over (punish people of) different nations at the same time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>R. Yanai would check a ferry [for leaks] before going on it - this is like he taught elsewhere:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> One should not go in a place of danger, expecting a miracle - perhaps a miracle will not be done for him; even if a miracle is done, it diminishes from his merits.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanin):</span> He learns from "Katonti mi'Kol ha'Chasadim umi'Kol ha'Emes" (Yakov's merits were reduced through the miracles Hash-m did for him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>R. Zeira would not go between date trees on a day when the south wind was blowing (it can topple walls).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak brei d'Rav Yehudah):</span> One should pray that he not get sick, for one who is sick needs merits to be cured.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Ukva):</span> He learns from "Ki Yipol ha'Nofel <i>Mimenu</i>" - if one falls, proof is required from him (that he merits to be saved).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Ki <i>Yipol ha'Nofel</i> Mimenu" - he is called 'ha'Nofel' even before he fell, for accidents were decreed from the Creation - [nevertheless, one must build a railing around his roof,] for good things happen through virtuous people, bad things happen through those lacking merit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one is sick and about to die, we tell him to confess, just like one who is executed confesses [in order to get a share in the world to come].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>One who goes in the market should view himself [to be in danger] as if he was handed over to a magistrate; one who has a slight headache should view himself as if he has a noose around his neck (and is being judged); one who is bedridden on account of illness should view himself as if he was being judged in Gardom (where they try the most serious offenders, almost all are killed);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One in Gardom is not saved unless he has great advocates.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The advocates are Teshuvah and Ma'asim Tovim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Even if 999 condemn, and one advocates, he will be saved - "Mal'ach Melitz Echad Mini Elef...Peda'ehu..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Eliezer, son of R. Yosi ha'Galili says, even if the advocate has 999 reasons to condemn, and one reason to acquit, he will be saved - "Melitz Echad Mini Elef"</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CAUSES OF EARLY DEATH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> Women die when giving birth on account of [these] three transgressions;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Eliezer says, women die young [on account of them, even not at the time of birth];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Acha says, they die because they launder [clothing dirty from] their children's excrement on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Some say, this is because they call the Aron Kodesh 'Aron' (just like they call chests; Chachamim also call it Aron, but they do not call anything else Aron).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael ben Elazar):</span> Amei ha'Aretz (ignoramuses) die on account of two things - they call the Aron Kodesh 'Aron', and they call the synagogue 'Beis Am' (a lowly name, i.e. everyone gathers there. Malei ha'Ro'im - the same name is used for theatres; Chachmas Mano'ach - they do not attribute the Beis ha'Kneses to [Keneses Yisrael, which alludes to] the Shechinah, rather, to people.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> Three ['transgressions] are Badkei Misah (reasons why one might not be saved from danger) in women - Nidah, Chalah and lighting Neros;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Some call these Davkei Misah (they cause premature death).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yosi holds like the first Tana of Beraisa #1, the latter opinion holds like R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> Laws of Hekdesh, Terumos and Ma'aseros are fundamentals of Torah, the Torah trusts Amei ha'Aretz about them. (Chachamim later saw reason to suspect them about Ma'aseros.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">32b----------------------------------------32b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Noson):</span> A man's wife is prone to die on account of his vows [to Hekdesh that he does not fulfill] - "Im Ein Lecha Leshalem Lamah Yikach Mishkavcha mi'Tachtecha".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Rebbi says, minors die on account of vows of their parents - "Al Titen Es Picha Lachati Es Besarecha...v'Chibel Es Ma'ase Yadecha " - the handiwork of man is his children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Shimon):</span> Children die on account of vows of their parents;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>R. Yehudah ha'Nasi says, they die on account of Bitul Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Eliezer learns from the above verse, but what is R. Yehudah ha'Nasi's source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from "La'Shav Hikeisi Es Beneichem Musar Lo Lakachu (did I strike your children for nought?! No - it was because they did not learn)".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> R. Eliezer also learns from this verse - children are stricken on account of Shav (vain vows).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rebbi is R. Yehudah ha'Nasi - he contradicts himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beraisa #1 was taught after he heard [and accepted] R. Eliezer's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS OF OTHER <i>MITZVOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba or R. Yosi):</span> [Children die] on account of [not fulfilling] the Mitzvah of Mezuzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(The other of R. Chiya bar Aba and R. Yosi):</span> [They die] on account of Bitul Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>(The second Parshah of Shma discusses Divrei Torah, then Mezuzah, then mentions long life.) The first opinion expounds ["Lema'an Yirbu Yemeichem vi'Mei Veneichem"] to be contingent on the previous verse, but not the verse before the previous verse;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The latter opinion expounds it to refer to the previous verse and the verse before that.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Meir or R. Yehudah):</span> [Children die] on account of [not fulfilling] the Mitzvah of Mezuzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(The other of R. Meir and R. Yehudah):</span> [They die] on account of [not fulfilling] Tzitzis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand the first opinion - it says "Lema'an Yirbu Yemeichem vi'Mei Veneichem" right after "U'Chsavtam Al Mezuzos Beisecha uvi'Sh'arecha";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is the source of this of the latter opinion?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> [Shortly after "La'Shav Hikeisi..." it says "Gam bi'Chnafayich Nimtze'u Dam Nafshos Evyonim Nekiyim".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The first opinion learns from the end of this verse - "Lo va'Machteres Metzasim" - their doorways were like tunnels [without Mezuzos].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The latter opinion expounds it to refer to the previous verse and the verse before that.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> One who zealously fulfills Tzitzis will have [in the future] 2800 slaves (10 from each of the 70 nations on each of the four corners of his garment) - "Ba'Yamim ha'Hemah Asher Yachaziku Asarah Anashim mi'Kol Leshonos ha'Goyim v'Hecheziku bi'Chnaf Ish Yehudi..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nechemyah):</span> Groundless hatred is punished by an increase of quarrels in one's house, miscarriages, and children dying young.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Yehudah says, [failure to take] Chalah is punished by a lack of Berachah is stored [food], causing a rise in prices; people plant, and others reap it - "V'Hifkadti (I will diminish) Aleichem Behalah...U'Zratem la'Rik Zar'achem va'Achaluhu Oyveichem";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We read "Behalah" like 'b'Chalah'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>If people take Chalah, they will be blessed - "Reishis Arisoseichem Titnu la'Kohen Lehani'ach Berachah El Beisecha".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Failure to give Terumos and Ma'aseros is punished by Shamayim withholding rain and dew, causing a rise in prices; people cannot earn money, they seek income and do not attain it - "Tziyah Gam Chom Yigzelu Meimei Sheleg..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we learn this from the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Tana d'vei R. Yishmael):</span> On account of things I commanded in summer [when crops are harvested] which you did not fulfill, water of [melting] snow will be withheld in winter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>If they give, they will be blessed - "Havi'u Es Kol ha'Ma'aser...va'Harikosi Lachem Bracha Ad Bli Dai".</p>
