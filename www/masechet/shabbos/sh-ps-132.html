<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>MILAH</i> OVERRIDES SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> (Beraisa - R. Eliezer): Milah and all its Machshirim override Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his source?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He cannot learn from all the Machshirim discussed above, for the reasons given above!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Further, the other Mitzvos apply only for a limited time (but if Milah is postponed, it can be done the next day)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from "Uva'Yom ha'Shmini Yimol Besar Arlaso" - even on Shabbos. (We will learn Milah itself from another source, so the verse teaches about Machshirim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should learn other Machshirim from Milah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn from Milah, for 13 covenants were made on it (it says "Bris" 13 times when Hash-m commanded Avraham about it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim only argue about Machshirei Milah, they agree that Milah itself overrides Shabbos - what is the source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula and R. Yitzchak):</span> This is a tradition from Moshe from Sinai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> [Beraisa #2 below teaches that] we cannot learn a Kal va'Chomer from a tradition from Sinai (yet a Tana learns a Kal va'Chomer from the fact that Milah overrides Shabbos)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1) Question:</span> What is the source that Piku'ach Nefesh overrides Shabbos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar ben Azaryah):</span> Milah involves just one limb of a person, yet it overrides Shabbos - all the more so, saving the whole body!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> R. Eliezer told R. Akiva, [the Tum'ah of] a bone the size of a barley seed is a tradition from Sinai - you cannot learn a Kal va'Chomer to a Revi'is of blood (to obligate a Nazir to Megale'ach and start Nezirus again) from a tradition!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Elazar):</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Os-Os" from Shabbos ("U'Nmaltem...l'Os Bris"; Shabbos is "Os Hi Beini u'Veineichem").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It also says Os regarding Tefilin ("V'Hayah Lecha l'Os Al Yadcha") - we should say that Tefilin overrides Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Bris-Bris" ("U'Nmaltem...l'Os Bris"; "La'asos Es ha'Shabos l'Dorosam Bris Olam").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, Milah of an adult should override Shabbos (it says "Es Brisi Hefar")!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Doros-Doros" ("L'Doroseichem Bris Olam"; "U'Ven Shemonas Yomim...l'Doroseichem").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, Tzitzis should override Shabbos ("V'Asu Lahem Tzitzis...l'Dorosam")!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> We learn Milah [on day eight] from Shabbos, for regarding both of these it says Bris, Os <i>and</i> Doros - it says only one of these regarding each of the other three (Tefilin, Milah of an adult, and Tzitzis).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #6 (R. Yochanan):</span> We learn from "Uva'Yom [ha'Shmini]"- even on Shabbos. (This is like Chachamim; R. Eliezer learns from a tradition from Sinai, he does not learn Piku'ach Nefesh from Milah like R. Elazar ben Azaryah does.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> Regarding Mechusar Kipurim (one who was Tamei and must bring a Korban to complete his Taharah) it says "Uva'Yom ha'Shmini" - will you say that this overrides Shabbos?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> "Uva'Yom" comes to exclude night.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also regarding Milah, we should say that "Ba'Yom" comes to exclude night!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding Milah it already says "U'Ven Shemonas Yomim".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding Korbanos it already says "B'Yom Tzavoso"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even though it says "B'Yom Tzavoso", we need "Uva'Yom ha'Shmini" - since the Torah allows bringing Mechusar Kipurim b'Dalos (an Oni brings a cheaper Korban), one might have thought it is also lenient to allow bringing at night - "Uva'Yom ha'Shmini" teaches, this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> If so (the leniency to bring b'Dalos is Machshir what is normally Pasul), a non-Kohen or Onen (one who lost a relative today) should be Kosher to offer Mechusar Kipurim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Uva'Yom ha'Shmini" teaches that night and all other Pesulim apply to Mechusar Kipurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #7 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> We learn from "Ha'Shmini"- even on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is needed to teach that it cannot be on day seven!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We already know this from "U'Ven Shemonas Yomim"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We need two verses, to exclude day seven and day nine!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we only had one verse, one might have thought that before day eight is not the time for Milah, but anything afterwards is the time [and overrides Shabbos]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must learn like R. Yochanan. (There was no objection to Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak's answer - however, the following Beraisa supports R. Yochanan.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>MILAH</i> OVERRIDES SHABBOS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan, and question against Rav Acha - Beraisa):</span> "[Uva'Yom Ha']Shmini Yimol" - even on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it says "Mechalaleha Mos Yumas"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to Melachos other than Milah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it refers even to Milah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, how would we explain "Ha'Shmini Yimol"?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is when the eighth day is not Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Uva'Yom"- even on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Why did the Tana initially hold that the verse permits Milah on Shabbos, and later suggest that it does not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> First he thought that "Ha'Shmini Yimol" - is even on Shabbos, and "Mechalaleha Mos Yumas" refers to Melachos other than Milah, but Milah overrides Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn a Kal va'Chomer from [cutting off] Tzara'as - Tzara'as overrides Avodah (we do not cut off Tzara'as to Machshir someone for Avodah), and Avodah (e.g. Temidim and Musafim) overrides Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">132b----------------------------------------132b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Milah overrides Tzara'as (if there is Tzara'as on the foreskin, one cuts it off) which overrides Avodah which overrides Shabbos, all the more so Milah overrides Shabbos! (Tzara'as on the end of the Ever is not Tamei (Nega'im 6:7) - nevertheless, one may not cut Tzara'as even if it is Tahor (Bo'az Nega'im 7:5 - see below 3:p:2); alternatively, if the Nega spread to there from somewhere else, it is Tamei. Alternatively - Tzara'as is Tamei even on extremal limbs if there is a flat area the size of a Gris (Rambam Tzara'as 3:9) - we may learn from the law in such a case, even if [in practice] we never find foreskin like this - <b>PF</b>.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he later doubt this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps Shabbos is more stringent than Tzara'as, for it has many punishments and prohibitions - Tzara'as does not override Avodah, rather, we may not cut off the Tzara'as, for the person would still be Pasul for Avodah (this will be explained)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The Tana continues, if so, we would have to say that "Ha'Shmini Yimol" applies when the eighth day is not Shabbos - "Uva'Yom" teaches, even on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>MILAH</i> OVERRIDES <i>TZARA'AS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Milah overrides Tzara'as, whether or not it is in its time (day eight); Milah overrides Yom Tov only in its time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Yimol Besar Arlaso" - even if there is Tzara'as there, he cuts it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it says 'Hishamer b'Nega ha'Tzara'as"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This applies to other parts of the body.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it applies even to the foreskin!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it says "Yimol Besar Arlaso"!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That would apply when there is no Tzara'as there.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Besar" (this is extra) - even if there is Tzara'as there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Why did the Tana initially hold that Milah overrides Tzara'as, and later suggest that it does not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer:</span> First he thought that "Yimol Besar Arlaso" is even if there is Tzara'as there; "Hishamer b'Nega ha'Tzara'as" applies to other parts of the body, but Milah overrides Tzara'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn a Kal va'Chomer - even though Shabbos is stringent, Milah overrides it - Tzara'as is more lenient, all the more so Milah overrides it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he later doubt this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps Tzara'as is more stringent than Shabbos, for Tzara'as overrides Avodah, and Avodah overrides Shabbos - therefore, we need "Besar" to permit Milah in the place of Tzara'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer:</span> First he thought that Milah overrides Tzara'as because an Ase overrides a Lav;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he later doubt this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps an Ase overrides a Lav alone - but there is also an Ase not to cut Tzara'as ("V'La'asos k'Chol Asher Yoru Eschem")!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it says "Yimol Besar Arlaso"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That would apply when there is no Tzara'as there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Therefore, we need "Besar" to permit even if there is Tzara'as there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Besar" regarding an adult ("Asher Lo Yimol Es Besar Arlaso") and an eight-day old ("Yimol Besar Arlaso") - what is the source that Milah of a minor above eight days overrides Tzara'as?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> We learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah of an adult and eight-day old:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We cannot learn [just] from an adult, for he is Chayav Kares if he does not circumcise himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We cannot learn [just] from an eight-day old, for this is its time;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Tzad ha'Shavah is that they must be circumcised, and this overrides Tzara'as - the same applies to everyone that must be circumcised.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> No verse is needed to teach that Milah in its time overrides Tzara'as, a Kal va'Chomer teaches this! (Since we do not need "Besar" to teach about Milah in its time, we use it to teach about Milah after eight days.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Milah overrides Shabbos, which is stringent - all the more so it overrides Tzara'as!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Safra):</span> Perhaps Tzara'as is more stringent than Shabbos, for Tzara'as overrides Avodah, and Avodah overrides Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> Tzara'as does not override Avodah - we may not cut off the Tzara'as for the person would still be Pasul for Avodah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> After the Tzara'as is cut off, he should be Kosher for Avodah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He must immerse first (and afterwards he is Tevul Yom until evening - we do not override Tzara'as to Machshir him to serve tomorrow).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This applies to Tamei Nega'im - how can we answer regarding Tahor Nega'im? (Tosfos Shevu'os 4A - they were declared Teme'im, but got weaker; the Metzora already immersed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> An Ase overrides a Lav only in cases like Milah where there is Tzara'as, or wearing Tzitzis with Kil'ayim, for he fulfills the Ase at the time he transgresses the Lav - but we may not cut off Tzara'as to Machshir someone for Avodah, since he could not do Avodah until after we transgress!</p>
