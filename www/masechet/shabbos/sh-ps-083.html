<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE TUM'AH OF IDOLS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim learn from the Hekesh to Nidah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Just like Tum'as Nidah does not apply to a limb, also the Tum'ah of idols.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Akiva, why is it equated to Nidah - it could have been equated to Nevelah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is to teach that the Tum'ah of idols does not apply to a limb.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chama bar Gurya asked whether or not [the Tum'ah] of idols applies to limbs - he should learn from here all agree that it does not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Chama learns like Rabah and asks according to R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Idolatry and Meshamsheha are [Metamei] like a Sheretz;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva says, Idolatry is like a Nidah, Meshamsheha are like a Sheretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is like R. Elazar, it is unlike Rabah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (on behalf of Rabah):</span> Also a Mishnah <i>seems to</i> refute me - but just like I can explain the Mishnah, I can explain the Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> The wood, stones and dirt of idols are Metamei like a Sheretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> This means that they are not Metamei b'Even Misma (but they have Tum'as Masa).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Also the Beraisa says that idols are Metamei like a Sheretz to teach that it is not Metamei b'Even Misma!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT HAS <i>TUM'AS HESET</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A Nochri, Nochris, idols and Meshamsheha are Teme'im, but not Heseitan (what moves them, i.e. they lack Tum'as Masa);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva says, they and Heseitan [are Teme'im].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is like R. Elazar, it is unlike Rabah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rabah):</span> Our text of the Beraisa is Metaher Nochrim from Tum'as Masa - this is wrong!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Dabru El Benei Yisrael... Ki Yihyeh Zav" - mid'Oraisa, Zivah (of a man or woman) only applies to Benei Yisrael, but Chachamim decreed that Nochrim are like Zavim (or Zavos) in all respects.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> Rather, it should say, a Nochri and Nochris - they and Heseitan and their Even Misma (i.e. an Even Misma that they sat on) are Teme'im;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Idolatry and its Heset are Teme'im, their Even Misma is not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, idols and their Even Misma are Teme'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Elazar):</span> It should say, a Nochri and Nochris - they and Heseitan and their Even Misma are Teme'im;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Idolatry is Tamei, its Heset is not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, idols and their Heset are Teme'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> If you say that 'Heseitan' means 'what move them', there would be no need to teach '<i>They and</i> Heseitan...are Teme'im' - if Heseitan is Tamei, surely they are Teme'im!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> It means, a Nochri and Nochris, [what] they [moved] and Heseitan (what moved them) are Teme'im;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What idols moved is Tahor, what moved idols is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>What Meshamsheha moved and what moved Meshamsheha are Tehorim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Akiva says, a Nochri and Nochris and idols, what they moved and what moved them are Teme'im;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>What Meshamsheha moved and what moved Meshamsheha are Tehorim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand 'What moved idols' - but what is 'What idols moved'?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rami brei d'Rav Yeiva - Mishnah):</span> If a Zav was on a pan of a balance scale, and food and drink were on the other pan:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Zav outweighed them, they are Teme'im; if they outweighed the Zav, they are Tehorim. (Likewise, if idols outweighs something, it is as if it moves it.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">83b----------------------------------------83b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like which Tana is the following?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If any Tum'ah moved an object, the object is Tahor - the only exception is a Zav, there is no other such Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is unlike R. Akiva, for he is Metamei its Heset!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is even like R. Akiva - it means, a Zav and all similar Tum'os.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LENIENCIES AND STRINGENCIES OF THE <i>TUM'AH</i> OF IDOLS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chama bar Gurya):</span> Does [the Tum'as] of idols apply to limbs? (Tosfos - he discusses an idol of big parts, it is not Batul (permitted) even if a commoner cannot reassemble it, the only question is about Tum'ah; R. Akiva Eiger - he discusses a Yisrael's idol, which is never Batul - we need not say that the parts are big [or that the size of the parts affects Bitul].)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> He need not ask about a case where a commoner can reassemble it -.surely, it is as if it is connected;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He asks about when only a craftsman can reassemble it:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since a commoner cannot reassemble it, it is considered broken (it is Tahor);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, since it is not missing anything, it is Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> He need not ask about a case where a commoner cannot reassemble it -.surely, it is as if it is broken;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He asks about when a commoners can reassemble it:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since a commoner can reassemble it, it is considered connected (it is Tamei);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, since it is now disconnected, it is Tahor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Achdevoy bar Ami):</span> What is the law of idols less than a k'Zayis?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> What does he ask about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He asks whether or not it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Surely it is forbidden, like the fly of Ekron!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Va'Yasimu Lahem Ba'al Bris Leilohim" - this is the fly of Ekron, this teaches that everyone made an image of his god and kept it in his pocket;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>When he would think of it, he would take it out and hug and kiss it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He asks whether or not it is Tamei:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since idols are equated to Sheratzim, just like ka'Adashah (the size of a lentil) of a Sheretz is Tamei, also ka'Adashah of idols;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, since idols are equated to Mes, just like the Shi'ur for Tum'as Mes is k'Zayis, also for idols!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Avya - Beraisa):</span> Idolatry less than a k'Zayis has no Tum'ah at all - "Va'Yashlech Es Afarah El Kever Benei ha'Am" - just like the Shi'ur Tum'as of Mes is k'Zayis, also of idols.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Chachamim expound all the Hekeshim for leniencies?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They say that idols are equated to Sheratzim to teach that it is not Metamei b'Masa, it is equated to Nidah to Metaher limbs, it is equated to Mes to teach that ka'Adashah is not Metamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>All of these could be expounded for stringencies! The Hekesh to Sheratzim could teach that ka'Adashah is Metamei, the Hekesh to Nidah could Metamei Even Misma, the Hekesh to Mes could teach Tum'as Ohel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the Tum'ah of idols is mid'Rabanan, they expound to be lenient.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A BOAT IS <i>TAHOR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> What is the source that a boat is Tahor?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Derech Aniyah v'Lev Yam" (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Obviously, a boat goes in the sea - what does the verse teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This equates a boat to the sea - just like the sea is Tahor, also a boat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chananyah):</span> We learn from Sak - just like Sak [is Mekabel Tum'ah only if it] can be moved when empty and full, the same applies to everything [of wood], but not a boat, it cannot be moved when full.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the first answer and Chananyah's?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They argue about a boat of Cheres - if we learn from "Aniyah v'Lev Yam" it is Tahor, if we learn from [the Hekesh to] Sak it is Tamei (the Hekesh does not apply to Klei Cheres).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They argue about a [small] boat that goes on the Yarden - if we learn from "Aniyah v'Lev Yam" it is Tahor, if we learn from Sak it is Tamei (it can be moved when empty and full).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina ben Akiva):</span> Sefinas ha'Yarden is Tamei because they load it on the dry land and take it to the water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One should never be absent from the Beis Medrash, even for a moment - this Mishnah was learned for many years, but the reason was not known until R. Chanina ben Akiva explained it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yonason):</span> One should never abstain from the Beis Medrash and words of Torah, even at the time of death - "Zos ha'Torah Adam Ki Yamus b'Ohel".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "Zos ha'Torah Adam Ki Yamus b'Ohel" - Divrei Torah last only in someone who kills himself [has nothing to do with the world, except] for Torah.</p>
