<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The Reisha (other Mitzvos are more lenient) refers to idolatry, the Seifa (other Mitzvos are more stringent) refers to other Mitzvos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of Shogeg without intention regarding other Mitzvos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He thought that he was eating permitted fat, and it was really Chelev.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The corresponding case regarding Shabbos - he intended to cut something detached, and cut something attached, he is exempt. (This culminates Rava's support for himself.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Abaye cannot explain like this (he obligates) - how will he explain Shogeg without intention?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question (b)):</span> He thought that saliva was on his tongue and he swallowed it (and it was really Chelev);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The corresponding case regarding Shabbos - he intended to pick up something detached, and cut something attached, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one intended to throw two Amos and it went four Amos, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> He is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rava exempts, for he did not intend to throw four Amos; Abaye obligates, for he intended to throw in any case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one thought that he was in Reshus ha'Yachid [and threw four Amos], and it was really Reshus ha'Rabim, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> He is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Rava exempts, for he did not intend to throw where it is forbidden; Abaye obligates, for he intended to throw in any case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>We must teach all three arguments:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we only taught the first, we would have thought that there Rava exempts, for he did not intend for a forbidden cutting, but he would obligate when he intended to throw two Amos, for throwing two Amos is a requisite for throwing four Amos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If we only taught the second, we would have thought that there Rava exempts, for he did not intend to throw four Amos, but he would obligate when he erred about the Reshus, for he intended to throw four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are 39 Avos Melachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need to know the number?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> This teaches that if one did all of them in one Helam, he is liable for each.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Abaye, we understand how this can be - he knew about Shabbos and the Melachos, he erred about Shi'urim (e.g. he intended to do half a Shi'ur);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava exempts in such a case - how can he explain?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He knew that it was Shabbos, he forgot the Melachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yochanan, we can say that he remembered that a Lav forbids Melachah, he forgot that there is Kares;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But according to Reish Lakish, he must be Shogeg even about the Lav [to bring a Korban] - if he forgot all of the Melachos, in what way did he remember Shabbos?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He remembered that it is forbidden to leave the Techum, according to R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE 39 <i>MELACHOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are 39 Melachos (they will be explained in this and coming Perakim) - seeding, plowing, reaping, making piles, threshing, winnowing, Borer (selecting), grinding, sifting, kneading, baking;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Shearing wool, laundering, Menapetz (banging wool to crush and remove impurities; alternatively, separating clumps into fibers; alternatively, brushing and combing it), dying, spinning, Meisach (arranging the warp threads on a loom), making two Batei Nirin (passing two warp threads through holes in a frame that lifts and lowers warp threads on a loom), weaving two threads, Potze'a two [warp] threads (cutting off excess if they are frayed; alternatively, cutting them off the loom, tying, untying, sewing two stitches, tearing in order to sew two stitches;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Hunting a deer, slaughtering, flaying, salting (the hide), tanning the hide, Memachek (scraping the skin), cutting [it into strips];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Writing two letters, erasing in order to write two letters, building, destroying, extinguishing, burning, Makeh b'Patish (finishing a Kli), and Hotza'ah from Reshus to Reshus - these are 39 Melachos.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SOWING AND PLOWING ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Seeding and plowing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tana should have taught plowing first (it precedes seeding)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana is from Eretz Yisrael, where people plow also after seeding [to cover the seeds, for the land is hard - the Tana teaches that also the second plowing is a Melachah].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Seeding, pruning, planting [saplings], Mavrich (sticking roots into the ground to grow) and grafting are all the same Melachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Chidush?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that one who does many Melachos that are variants of one Melachah is liable only once.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha):</span> Pruning is liable for planting (if one was warned not to plant and he pruned, he is killed); planting, pruning, Mavrich and grafting are liable for seeding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Are they liable for seeding, but not for planting?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means, they are liable even for seeding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> If one pruned and needed the wood, he is liable twice - for reaping and for planting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> One who cut fodder is liable twice, for reaping and for planting (it causes more to grow).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> One who harvests beets is liable twice, for reaping and for planting (it causes more to grow).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Plowing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Plowing, digging and making furrows are all one Melachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> If someone removed a small mound of dirt in a house, he is liable for [leveling the floor for] building;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he did so in a field, he is liable for plowing (this softens the ground).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If someone filled a small pit in a house with dirt, he is liable for building;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he did so in a field, he is liable for plowing (this makes it fit to be seeded).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> If someone dug a pit on Shabbos and only needed the dirt, he is exempt, even according to R. Yehudah who is Mechayev Melachah she'Einah Tzerichah l'Gufah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah is Mechayev only for improvements - this is destructive.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>MELACHOS</i> INVOLVING PRODUCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reaping.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Reaping, reaping grapes, reaping dates, reaping olives, and reaping figs are all one Melachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If someone threw a clump of dirt at a date tree and knocked down dates, he is liable twice, for uprooting (a Toldah of reaping) and for Mefarek (a Toldah of threshing. Rashi - he removes the dates from the tree; Tosfos - he knocked the shells off the dates.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> [He is exempt -] this is not the normal way to uproot or to Mefarek.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Making piles.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one gathers salt from the place where they evaporate seawater to make salt, he is liable for making piles.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> [He is exempt -] making piles applies only to Gidulei Karka (things that grow from the ground).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Threshing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Threshing, Menapetz (beating stems to remove the flax) and Menapet (beating cotton to remove the seeds) are all one Melachah.</p>
