<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> One who is missing a foot may go out with a Kav (false foot; it houses what remains of his leg, it is a shoe for him);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi forbids (it is not a Tachshit).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If it has a receptacle for tufts (for his leg to rest on) it is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>[If he is missing both feet and walks on his knees,] his Semuchos (leather he puts under his knees) are Mekabel Tum'as Medras, he may go out with them on Shabbos (it is a Tachshit), he may enter the Mikdash with them (they are not considered shoes);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>[If he is missing both feet and cannot walk on his knees,] his chair and its Semuchos are Mekabel Tum'as Medras, he may not go out with them on Shabbos, he may not enter the Mikdash with them (they are like shoes for him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Luktamin (this will be explained) is Tahor, one may not go out with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rava) Question:</span> What is the text of our Mishnah (I know that R. Meir is first and R. Yosi argues - does R. Meir permit or forbid), and what is the Halachah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav Nachman did not know either of these.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel and Rav Huna):</span> The text is, [R. Meir] forbids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Since both say 'forbids', we will adopt this text.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rabah bar Ula):</span> You did not hear that Rav Chanan bar Rava was teaching Rav's son that R. Meir forbids and R. Yosi permits, and Rav gestured to him to switch the opinions!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> A way to remember who says what is Samech - Samech (R. Yosi, who has a Samech in his name, is Oser (forbids - this word also contains a Samech)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Shmuel retracted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one did Chalitzah with a sandal which is not his, or of wood, or a left sandal on his right foot, it is Kosher;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana that considers a wooden shoe to be a shoe?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> it is R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> One who is missing a foot may go out with a Kav;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yosi forbids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Also Rav Huna retracted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Akiva):</span> The following apply to a sandal of plasterers (Tosfos - it is a plastering tool with room to insert one's hand, and it can also be worn like a sandal; alternatively, it is used to cover his shoes. Rashi - it is a sandal made of straw, for plaster ruins leather; Rashi's Rebbi'im - it is of wood):</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is Mekabel Tum'as Medras, it is Kosher for Chalitzah, and one may go out with it on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chachamim agreed with him [regarding Tum'ah].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> Chachamim disagreed with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Chachamim that agreed with him hold like R. Meir [in our Mishnah, who considers something to be a shoe even it is not made of leather], those that disagreed hold like R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> No - the Chachamim that disagreed hold like R. Yochanan ben Nuri:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> A straw chest or a tube of reeds is Mekabel Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yochanan ben Nuri is Metaher (because it is not normal to make them from these materials; alternatively, these materials are not included in the category of wooden Kelim that are Mekabel Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Akiva say that a sandal of plasterers is Mekabel Tum'as Medras - it is not made for walking!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha bar Rav Ula):</span> A plasterer walks home in it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SOMETHING ONE OCCASIONALLY LEANS ON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If [a Kav] has a receptacle for tufts it is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> It is Mekabel Tum'as Mes (and Tum'os of touching), but not Tum'as Medras (he does not usually lean on it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It is even Mekabel Tum'as Medras.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rava, for himself - Mishnah):</span> A child's wagon is Mekabel Tum'as Medras (it is primarily for play, occasionally he sits or leans on it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> It is made to lean on (the child practices walking with it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Abaye, for himself - Beraisa):</span> A walking stick for an elder is totally Tahor [even though he leans on it sometimes].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> The stick is merely to straighten his steps (he does not lean on it at all);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">66b----------------------------------------66b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Kav is made to lean on, and he leans on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [His chair and its Semuchos] are Mekabel Tum'as Medras; he may not go out with them, and he may not enter the Mikdash with them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(A reciter of Beraisos):</span> He may enter the Azarah with them (Semuchos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yochanan):</span> I learn [in a Beraisa] that they are Kosher for Chalitzah (they are considered shoes), you cannot say that he may enter the Azarah with them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, your Beraisa should say 'He may <i>not</i> enter the Azarah with them.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Luktamin is Tahor, one may not go out with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Luktamin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Avahu):</span> It is a jester's donkey (he carries it, and it looks like he rides on it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava bar Papa):</span> They are (Aruch - jester's) stilts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> It is a mask (Rashi; R. Chananel - it is a cloth on the mouth for drool).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PERMITTED CURES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Boys may go out with Kesharim (this will be explained), princes may go out with bells;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Everyone is permitted, Chachamim discussed the usual cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What are Kesharim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman bar Baruch):</span> It is Pu'ah (a plant used to make dye) wrapped up.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Abaye's mother:</span> Three of them hold [a certain sickness] in check, five of them cure, and seven of them help even against witchcraft!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> This is only if it was not exposed to the sun, moon, or rain, nor the sound of iron, roosters or footsteps.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> This renders the cure futile (no one can be careful about all this)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This applies to girls as well as boys, to adults as well as children - why does the Mishnah say that it is usually worn by boys?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is like Avin bar Huna taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Avin bar Huna):</span> If a son longs for his [R. Chananel - deceased] father, we tie a strap from the father's right shoe on the child's left [hand]. (Girls are not as attached to their fathers as boys.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> A way to remember this is Tefilin (the right hand ties on the left).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If this is reversed (a left shoe strap on the child's right hand), this is dangerous (he will long even more for him)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Avin bar Huna):</span> One may put a Sechufei cup over the stomach (R. Chananel - to stop it from bursting; Rashi - one spills out hot water from the cup beforehand - the air inside cools down, decreasing the air pressure; the stomach is sucked outwards, helping the intestines return to their proper position).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Avin bar Huna):</span> One may anoint [hands and feet] with oil and salt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When great Talmidim were drunk, e.g. Rav Huna [when he learned] in Rav's academy, Rav in R. Chiya's academy, and R. Chiya in Rebbi's academy, to sober them up they would anoint their palms and feet with oil, and say 'Just like the oil is clearing up [on account of his body heat], the wine should clear up from Ploni the son of Plonis'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If not, one should soak a cork [of a wine barrel] in water, and say 'Just like the cork is clearing up [from the wine absorbed], the wine should clear up from Ploni the son of Plonis.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Avin bar Huna):</span> [If a ring of the neck bone was dislocated and fell into the throat,] one may hang him from the head [to fix it].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Avin bar Huna):</span> [If a baby's joints were dislocated through birth,] one may wrap him in garments to fix them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rav Papa taught both teachings about children (Kesharim and fixing joints) in the name of Avin bar Huna;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Rav Zevid taught the first of them in Avin's name, and the latter in the name of Rabah bar bar Chanah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> One may wrap a baby in garments to straighten his joints.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Abaye's mother:</span> In any cure which requires repetition [of words], we use the name of [the patient and] his mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Abaye's mother:</span> If a cure specifies a number of repetitions, we follow it - if not, we repeat it 41 times.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may go out with a Tekumah stone [to prevent miscarriage];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>R. Meir permits to go out with something which [was put on a balance scale and] equaled the weight of a Tekumah stone.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not only for a woman who already miscarried, it is even for one who never miscarried;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is not only for a [Vadai] pregnant woman, it is even for one who might [have] become pregnant.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yemar bar Shalmiya):</span> This is only if the object naturally equaled the weight of a Tekumah stone [but not if it one added to or detracted from it to make it even].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> What is the law of something weighed [equally] against something weighed [equally] against of a Tekumah stone?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Abaye's mother:</span> For a fever on the first day (alternatively - that afflicts one every day), one should take a new coin of pure silver to the place where they evaporate water to make salt, take salt equal to its weight and wrap it and hang it next to the throat by a hair;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If not, he should go to a fork in the road, find a big ant carrying a load, put it in a copper tube, seal it well, shake it up, take the ant and say 'Your load is on me, and my load (sickness) is on you.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Huna):</span> If someone else did so to this ant, he invites that person's sickness on himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, he should say 'Your load and my load are on you.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If not, he should take a new cup to the river, say 'I am borrowing a cup of water for my journey', wave it seven times around his head, throw it in back of himself and say 'Take back your water - my journey started and ended today.'</p>
