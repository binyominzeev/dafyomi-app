<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> Is it such an exertion to return one's belt?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> One may pray without a belt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to Objection #2):</span> It is proper to pray with a belt, on account of "Hikon Likras Elokecha Yisrael".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rabah bar Rav Huna would put on nice socks before praying on account of "Hikon Likras Elokecha Yisrael".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rava would pray without his mantle and clench his hands on his fingers, [to appear undistinguished and to show fear] like a slave in front of his Master.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> When there was suffering in the world, Rav Kahana would pray without his mantle and clench his hands, like a slave in front of his Master;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>At times of Shalom, he would dress nicely and cover himself with a Talis on account of "Hikon Likras Elokecha Yisrael".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rava saw Rav Hamnuna pray at length - he said, 'He abandons eternal life (Torah, to pray) for temporary life (prayer is mostly for matters of this world)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav Hamnuna holds that Torah and Tefilah each have their time (we do not rush Tefilah in order to return to learning).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Yirmeyah was learning with R. Zeira (his Rebbi), the time to pray was expiring. R. Yirmeyah quickly rose to pray - R. Zeira cited "Mesir Ozno mi'Shmo'a Torah Gam Tefilaso To'evah" (Hash-m despises the prayer of one who does not want to learn)!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE TIME FOR JUDGMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered the beginning of judgment?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmeyah or R. Yonah):</span> It is from when the judges cloak themselves (cover their heads, to have more fear of Hash-m).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (The other of R. Yirmeyah and R. Yonah):</span> It is from when the litigants begin to state their claims.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>They do not argue - Answer #2 is when the judges had already been judging, Answer #1 is when they were not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Ami and R. Asi were learning between the pillars [that support the Beis Medrash]; they would periodically rap the bolt on the door and say 'If anyone has a case, come in!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rav Chisda and Rabah bar Rav Huna were judging the whole day, and they were getting weak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chiya bar Rav mi'Difti):</span> "Va'Ya'amod ha'Am Al Moshe Min ha'Boker Ad ha'Erev" - if Moshe indeed judged Yisrael the entire day, when did he learn?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, if one judges a case to its ultimate truth, even for a short time, the Torah considers him Hash-m's partner in creation - it says "Min ha'Boker Ad ha'Erev", like it says regarding creation, "Va'Yhi Erev va'Yhi Boker Yom Echad".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Until when do we sit in judgment?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> We sit until the time to eat (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chama):</span> He learns from "I Lach Eretz she'Malkech Na'ar v'Sarayich ba'Boker Yochelu Ashrech Eretz she'Malkech Ben Chorim v'Sarayich ba'Es Yochelu bi'Gvurah v'Lo va'Shesi" - they eat in the Gevurah (might) of Torah, not in the drinking of wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The first hour of the day is when Ludim eat (they are cannibals, they immediately fulfill their ravenous appetites);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Bandits eat in the second hour (they stay up at night), heirs [who did not work for their money] eat in the third hour, workers eat in the fourth hour, most people eat in the fifth hour...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> But Rav Papa taught that most people eat in the fourth hour!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, most people eat in the fourth hour, workers eat in the fifth hour, Chachamim eat in the sixth hour;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>(If one did not eat before noon,) eating after this does not help (it might be harmful) - it is like throwing a rock into a pouch with little wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This is only if he did not taste anything all morning - but if he ate [even a bit], there is no problem.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>DIVREI KEDUSHAH</i> IN A BATHHOUSE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> One may pray in the bathhouse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> In a bathhouse:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>[In the outer room,] where people are clothed, it is permitted to say Shma and pray, there is no need to say that one may give (greet someone with) 'Shalom'; one may put on Tefilin, there is no need to say that one need not remove Tefilin; (Ran - an Amora must explain his words, we cannot say that Rav Ada referred only to the outer room.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>[In the middle room,] where some people are clothed and others naked, one may give Shalom, it is forbidden to say Shma or pray; one need not remove Tefilin, but he may not put them on;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>[In the inner room,] where everyone is naked, one may not give Shalom, there is no need to say it is forbidden to say Shma or pray; one must remove Tefilin, there is no need to say he may not put them on.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav Ada permits prayer in an empty bathhouse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> But R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina taught that all Isurim of a bathhouse apply even when no one is there; all Isurim of a bathroom apply even when no excrement is there!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rav Ada permits prayer in a new bathhouse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ravina never resolved this question!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> If one designated a place to be a bathroom, does it take effect (to forbid Divrei Kedushah there before it is used)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The same question applies to a bathhouse!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps the question only pertains to a bathroom, for it is more repulsive.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> [In the inner room] one may not give Shalom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>This supports Rav Hamnuna:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> It is forbidden to give Shalom in a bathhouse [for this is a name of Hash-m - "Va'Yikra Lo Hash-m Shalom".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should also be forbidden to mention 'Emunah' in a Beis ha'Kisei, for it says "Ha'Kel ha'Ne'eman"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is indeed forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav permitted mentioning 'Emunah' in a Beis ha'Kisei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is different, for Emunah [is an attribute of Hash-m, it] is not His name - the Targum of Ha'Kel ha'Ne'eman is Eloka Mehemna (who is faithful).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m Himself is called Shalom - "Va'Yikra Lo Hash-m Shalom".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE GIVER SHOULD INFORM THE RECEIVER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava bar Machsiya citing Rav):</span> One who gives a gift should inform the receiver - "Lada'as Ki Ani Hash-m Mekadishchem".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> "Lada'as Ki Ani Hash-m Mekadishchem" - Hash-m told Moshe, I have a great gift in my treasure house, Shabbos, I want to give it to Yisrael - go tell them;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, this teaches that one who gives bread to a child should inform the child's mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How should he do this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> He should smear some oil between the child's eyes and paint around the eyes (when the mother asks about this, the child will mention that he received bread).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Nowadays, people would suspect that this was for the sake of witchcraft - what should one do instead?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> He should smear between the child's eyes some food like he gave to the child.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rav Chama b'Rebbi Chanina taught that one who gives a gift need not inform the receiver - "U'Moshe Lo Yoda Ki Karan Or Panav" (Moshe did not know that his face was radiating)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the receiver will find out anyway, the giver need not inform him; if not, he must.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Hash-m told Moshe to inform Yisrael about Shabbos, even though they would find out anyway!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They would not find out about the reward for guarding Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rav Chisda had two [sets of] Matanos (Zero'a, Lechayayim and Kevah given to a Kohen from a Chulin animal) from oxen - he offered them to whoever would tell him a teaching of Rav he had not yet heard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rava bar Machsiya citing Rav):</span> One who gives a gift should inform the receiver - "Lada'as Ki Ani Hash-m Mekadishchem".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Rav Chisda gave the Matanos to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Are Rav's teachings so dear to you?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> This is like Rav taught - a garment is dear to the wearer (you are Rav's Talmid, therefore his teachings are dear to you)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> I like that more than the first teaching - if I had more Matanos, I would give them to you!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>MORE TEACHINGS OF RAVA BAR MACHSIYA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava Bar Machsiya):</span> One should not favor one child over the others - a small amount of fine wool which Yakov added to Yosef's garment caused [his brothers to envy him, resulting in] the descent of our ancestors to Mitzrayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava Bar Machsiya):</span> One should strive to live in a city that was settled recently, for then its sins are fewer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Hine Na ha'Ir ha'Zos Krovah...v'Hi Mitz'ar" - what does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It (Tzo'ar) is nearby; "v'Hi Mitz'ar" - it is small.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There would be no need to say this, they could see it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, because it was settled [more] recently (one year after Sedom), its sins are fewer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin):</span> He learns from "Imaltah Na" - the Gematri'a (numerical value) of Na is 51 (alluding to 51 years), whereas Sedom was settled for 52:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sodom was serene for 26 years (for 26 of the 52 years it was afflicted) - "Shteim Esre Shanah Ovdu Es Kedarla'omer u'Shlosh Esre Shanah Maradu; Uv'Arba Esre Shanah..."</p>
