<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rav Katina taught that even when Yerushalayim stumbled, faithful people did not cease from it - "...Simlah Lechah Katzin Tihyeh Lanu" - you know matters that others seek to cover up [their ignorance about them] like with a garment;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Veha'Machshelah ha'Zos Tachas Yadecha" - you know matters that others understand only after stumbling in them, so you will be our leader.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW MUCH MAY ONE SAVE ON SHABBOS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may save a whole basket of loaves [from a fire], even if it has enough for 100 meals, or a [big] ring of figs or barrel of wine;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may tell others 'Come save for yourselves' - if they are clever, after Shabbos they will make a calculation with him.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We may save to a Chatzer that has an Eiruv;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ben Beseira):</span> We may save even to a Chatzer without an Eiruv;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Also, one may also save to there all Kelim that he uses [for eating and needs for Shabbos];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>He may wear and wrap himself with as much as he can;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>He may tell others 'Come save with me'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The Reisha permits saving only enough for three meals!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> One may save one basket, even if it has a lot; Lekapel (Rashi (19B) - to gather baskets in one big Kli; Tosfos - to save and go back and save again), he may save only enough for three meals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Aba bar Zavda):</span> Both discuss Lekapel - there is no limit when saving to the same Chatzer, he may save only for three meals to another Chatzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> If one spread his garment and put (Tosfos; Rashi - emptied) many Kelim into it, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is this like saving one Kli, or like Lekapel (because it is many exertions)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [A Beraisa teaches that if a barrel broke on the roof, one may bring and put a on the ground Rav Shizbi taught Rav Chisda 'on condition that he does not bring a Kli that holds more than three meals', and Rava said that this is a mistake (a big Kli is permitted) - this shows that it is like saving.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Why is Rav Shizbi wrong?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava - Seifa of Beraisa):</span> He may not bring another Kli to catch the falling stream in midair or where it leaves the roof.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Another Kli is forbidden, but the first Kli may be any size!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A ring of figs...[after Shabbos they make a calculation with him].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they calculate? What they took was Hefker (Rashi - for he said 'Save for yourselves'; Ran - because the owner may not save more himself)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> The Mishnah discusses Midas Chasidus (they go beyond the letter of the law - they return the food to him and he pays them for their toil).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> A Chasid would not take wages for what he did on Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Mishnah discusses one who fears Shomayim - he does not want to benefit from another [who was forced to Mafkir his food] - however, he does not want to [go beyond the letter of the law and] go unrewarded for his toil;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It teaches that if they are clever, and know that this is not wages for Shabbos, after Shabbos they will make a calculation with him.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding food, the owner cannot take more than three meals [the rest is Hefker] - regarding clothing, there is no limit to how much he can save.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> He may wear [clothes], go out, and remove them; wear, go out, and remove them, the whole day;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Nanas):</span> One may spread a [moist] kid's skin over a box that caught fire, because it gets charred [but does not burn, it will save the rest of the box];</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi forbids new Klei Cheres full of water, for they will break and extinguish the fire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> If one end of a Talis caught fire, one may put water on the other side - if it extinguishes, this is no problem.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yehudah holds like Ben Nanas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ben Nanas permits spreading a skin because it gets charred [and contains the fire] - does he permit Geram [causing] to extinguish?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes - in the Seifa, R. Yosi forbids new Klei Cheres full of water, for they will break and extinguish the fire - this implies that the first Tana permits!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a lamp is on a board, one may shake the board and it will fall - if it extinguishes, this is no problem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(D'vei R. Yanai):</span> This is only if he forgot it - if he intentionally left it on the board, the board is a Bosis for Isur (the lamp, so he may not shake the board).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a lamp is in back of a door, one may open and close it normally - if the lamp extinguishes, this is no problem.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Why did Rav curse them?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav holds like R. Yehudah (who forbids Davar she'Eino Miskaven), the Beraisa is like R. Shimon (who permits).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is no reason to curse them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> Even R. Shimon forbids this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye and Rava):</span> R. Shimon agrees that a Pesik Reisha is forbidden.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A normal wind is blowing - Abaye decrees lest one will open even when a very strong wind blows, Rav Yehudah does not decree.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>GRAMA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may make a Mechitzah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Chachamim permit Gram Kivuy (causing to extinguish), R. Yosi forbids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Elsewhere, they taught oppositely!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may make a Mechitzah with empty Kelim or with full Kelim that don't usually break, i.e. metal Kelim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, even [earthenware] Kelim of [clay of] Kefar Sichin and Kefar Chananyah don't usually break. (He is more lenient than Chachamim!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We can switch the opinions in our Mishnah (R. Yosi permits causing to extinguish, Chachamim forbid); in the Beraisa, R. Yosi addresses Chachamim according to their reasoning. (I permit causing to extinguish - even though you forbid; you should permit Kelim of Kefar Sichin, for they don't usually break!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rabah bar Tachlifa taught that R. Yosi forbids causing to extinguish!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not switch the Mishnah; the entire Beraisa is R. Yosi, it is abbreviated, it means as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may make a Mechitzah with empty Kelim or with full Kelim that don't usually break, e.g. metal Kelim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also Kelim of Kefar Sichin and Kefar Chananyah may be used, for they don't usually break - R. Yosi taught this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Chachamim and R. Yosi both contradict themselves!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Hash-m's name was written on a person he may not wash or anoint [lest this erase His name] or stand in a filthy place (it is disgraceful to His name);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he has a Mitzvah to immerse, he wraps a reed around it and immerses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yosi says, he immerses normally, as long as he does not rub it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Resolution (for R. Yosi):</span> Erasing Hash-m's name is different, for it says "V'Ibadtem Es Shemam...; Lo <i>Sa'asun</i> Ken la'Shem Elokeichem" - explicitly erasing the name is forbidden, Grama is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also regarding Shabbos, it says "Lo Sa'aseh Chol Melachah" - we should likewise expound, doing is forbidden, Grama is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because a person is frantic about [losing] his money, if we permit Grama he may overtly extinguish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the contradiction in Chachamim is even stronger!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim permit Grama regarding Shabbos, even though people are frantic about money - all the more so they should permit it regarding erasing Hash-m's name!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Surely, Chachamim do not require the reed on account of Chatzitzah - it would not help!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is tight, it is a Chatzitzah; if it is not tight, water will go through (and erase His name)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are we concerned that the reed is Chotzetz - the ink [of His name] itself is Chotzetz!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the ink is moist.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following are a Chatzizah if they are dry, not if they are wet - blood, ink, honey, and [a woman's] milk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Shila):</span> Chachamim forbid immersing because one may not be naked in front of Hash-m's name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Yosi permit to be naked in front of Hash-m's name?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, he covers the name with his hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim should also permit this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They forbid, lest he forget and remove his hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Yosi should also be concerned for this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> All agree that if a reed is available, he must use it - they argue about whether or not he must toil to find a reed:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi holds that Tevilah bi'Zmanah (to immerse at the first opportunity to become Tahor) is a Mitzvah - therefore, if he cannot find one, he immerses without it.</p>
