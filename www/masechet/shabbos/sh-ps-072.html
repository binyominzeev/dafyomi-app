<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CHILUK ASHAMOS FOR SHIFCHAH CHARUFAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> According to the opinion that one can bring an Asham Vadai without Yedi'ah (he is not yet sure that he sinned), if one had five acts of relations with a Shifchah Charufah (a [half] slave designated for an Eved Ivri, even if he found out in between each Bi'ah, the Yedi'os are unimportant and hence do not Mechalek), he brings only one</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Hamnuna):</span> If Reuven had relations with a Shifchah Charufah, was Makdish an Asham and said 'Do not offer it until I have relations again [so it will atone for both]', will you say that he is liable only once?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> I never said that a Korban atones for a transgression after Hafrashah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> According to the opinion that Asham Vadai requires Yedi'ah, if one had five acts of relations with a Shifchah Charufah (and found out in between each Bi'ah, the Yedi'os Mechalek, R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish agree that) he brings five Ashamos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> [Hakravas] Chatas requires Yedi'ah, yet R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish argue about it! (Reish Lakish surely holds that Yedi'os are not Mechalek.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rav Dimi could not answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Perhaps you mean, each Bi'ah after Hafrashah requires another Korban, like Rav Hamnuna taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Dimi:</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> All agree about Shifchah Charufah, all agree about [another law of] Shifchah Charufah, there is an argument about [a third law of] Shifchah Charufah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All agree that one is liable only once for many Bi'os [before Hafrashah], like Ula taught [according to the opinion that Asham Vadai does not require Yedi'ah];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>All agree that one is liable for each Bi'ah [after Hafrashah], like Rav Hamnuna taught;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>According to the opinion that Asham Vadai requires Yedi'ah, R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish argue [about whether or not Yedi'os are Mechalek].</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE WHO INTENDED TO PERFORM A PERMITTED ACTION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>If one intended to pick up something detached, and picked up something attached (Tosfos - he did not realize that it was attached; Rashi - he was trying to pick up something else), detaching it, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If he intended to cut something detached, and he cut something attached, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> He is Chayav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rava exempts, for he did not intend to cut something that may not be cut;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Abaye obligates, for he intended to cut in any case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rava, for himself - Beraisa):</span> There is a stringency of Shabbos over other Mitzvos, and there is a stringency of other Mitzvos over Shabbos:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The stringency of Shabbos - if two Melachos were done in one Helam, he is liable for each one, this is not so regarding other Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The stringency of other Mitzvos - if someone transgressed b'Shogeg without intention he is liable, this is not so regarding Shabbos. (We seek to explain the Reisha, the support for Rava comes at the end (73A).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Reisha):</span> The stringency of Shabbos over other Mitzvos is that if two Melachos were done in one Helam, he is liable for each.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he reaped and grinded - the corresponding case of other Mitzvos is eating Chelev and blood, also there he is liable for each!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We must say, regarding other Mitzvos he ate Chelev twice [in one Helam].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Also regarding Shabbos, if he reaped twice [in one Helam] he is liable only once!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, he reaped and grinded - the corresponding case of other Mitzvos is idolatry, as R. Ami taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> If someone slaughtered, burned and poured libations to idolatry in one Helam, he is liable only one Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot establish it regarding idolatry on account of the Seifa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> The stringency of other Mitzvos - if someone transgressed b'Shogeg without intention he is liable, this is not so regarding Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could someone transgress idolatry b'Shogeg without intention?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he thought he was bowing to a synagogue, and it really was idolatry, he intended to serve Hash-m (this is not idolatry)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, he bowed to a statue.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If he accepted it to be his god, he was Mezid; if not, he did not serve idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he served idolatry on account of love or fear [of a person].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Abaye, who obligates for serving on account of love or fear - according to Rava, who exempts, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> He thought that idolatry is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, in such a case regarding Shabbos, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rava only asked whether a person who forgot that it was Shabbos and forgot Melachos brings one Chatas, or for each Melachah - there was no side to say that he is totally exempt!</p>
