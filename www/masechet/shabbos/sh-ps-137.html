<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven had two babies to circumcise, one on Shabbos and one the next day, and he mistakenly circumcised the latter on Shabbos, he is Chayav [Chatas];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Eliezer says, if one baby should have been circumcised on Erev Shabbos and the other on Shabbos, and he mistakenly circumcised the former on Shabbos, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehoshua exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Huna):</span> The text in the Reisha is 'Chayav' (like our text).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The text is 'exempt'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Huna - Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua agree that if one mistakenly circumcised on Shabbos a [seven day old] baby due to be circumcised the next day, instead of the [eight day old] baby due to be circumcised on Shabbos, he is liable (he circumcised too early, this is not a Mitzvah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about one who mistakenly circumcised a nine day old [who should have been circumcised on Erev Shabbos] instead of the eight day old - R. Eliezer is Mechayev, R. Yehoshua exempts;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Both learn from idolatry (all Chayavei Chatas are equated to it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Eliezer holds, just like idolatry is a Lav [with Kares], and one who transgresses b'Shogeg is Chayav Chatas, the same applies to every such Lav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yehoshua holds, our case is unlike idolatry - there, he transgressed without doing a Mitzvah - here, he did a Mitzvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Yehudah - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua agree that if one mistakenly circumcised on Shabbos a nine day old instead of the eight day old, he is exempt (he did a Mitzvah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about one who mistakenly circumcised a seven day old instead of the eight day old - R. Eliezer is Mechayev, R. Yehoshua exempts;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Both learn from idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Eliezer holds, just like idolatry is a Lav [with Kares], and one who transgresses b'Shogeg is Chayav Chatas, the same applies to every such Lav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yehoshua holds, our case is unlike idolatry - there, he was not obsessed with doing a Mitzvah - here, he was obsessed with a Mitzvah (he needed to circumcise the eight day old)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Chiya):</span> R. Meir taught that R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua agree that if one mistakenly circumcised on Shabbos a nine day old instead of the eight day old, he is <i>liable</i>;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about one who mistakenly circumcised a seven day old instead of the eight day old - R. Eliezer is Mechayev, R. Yehoshua exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If R. Yehoshua exempts in the Seifa, when he did not do a Mitzvah, all the more so he should exempt in the Reisha, when he did a Mitzvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (D'vei R. Yanai):</span> The case [in the Reisha] is, he circumcised the baby due to be circumcised on Shabbos on Erev Shabbos - he had no Heter to circumcise on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Seifa, he had a Heter to circumcise on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Also in the Reisha, there is a Heter to circumcise other eight day babies in the world!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> [They are not the responsibility of this man,] he has no Heter to override Shabbos. (Rosh (5) - some learn from here that Hatafas Dam Bris is not needed for a baby without foreskin; Rif - the Halachah follows Rabah, Hatafas Dam Bris is on account of Safek covered foreskin, we do not override Shabbos on account of the doubt.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE EARLIEST AND LATEST WE MAY CIRCUMCISE A CHILD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A [healthy] baby is circumcised on day eight, nine, 10, 11 or 12, not earlier or later.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Normally, he is circumcised on day eight;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he was born Bein ha'Shemashos (Safek day, Safek night - we will call the morning before the birth day one), we must wait until day nine to circumcise (if he was really born at night, day nine is his eighth day, we cannot circumcise before this; if he was born during the day, day nine is his ninth day);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he was born Bein ha'Shemashos of Erev Shabbos, day nine is Shabbos, we cannot circumcise on Shabbos (only a Vadai eighth day Milah overrides Shabbos), we must wait until day 10;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the day after Shabbos is Yom Tov, we must wait until day 11;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We must wait until day 12 if the two days of Rosh Hashanah follow Shabbos. (Rambam - both days are like one long Kedushah - but we may circumcise on the second day of other Yomim Tovim; Rosh - it is forbidden on any Yom Tov Sheni.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>We do not circumcise a sick baby until it gets healthy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Shmuel):</span> If a baby had a fever, we wait seven days after he recovers before circumcising.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must we wait seven full (24-hour) days [or may we circumcise on the eighth Halachic day, even if less than 168 hours have elapsed]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ludah taught, the day of recovery is like the day of birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like we need not wait seven full days from the time of birth [before circumcising - a baby born in the afternoon may be circumcised on the morning of day eight], we need not wait seven full days from the time of recovery!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No - [the similarity is that both require waiting seven days, but] the day of recovery is more severe than the day of birth - the [wait after the] day of birth does not require full days, but [that of] the day of recovery does.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN MORE OF THE FORESKIN MUST BE CUT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following strands invalidate Milah - flesh which covers the majority of the crown;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>[A Kohen with such strands is an Arel,] he may not eat Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If his Ever is thick [and it looks like foreskin remains,] we trim it so he will not look like an Arel.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">137b----------------------------------------137</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he circumcised but [left foreskin and] did not expose the Milah, it is as if he did not circumcise.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Avina):</span> [Rashi - even; Rambam - only] flesh which covers the majority of the height of the crown [invalidates Milah].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If his Ever is thick...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If a child is fleshy [and the Milah appears to be covered]:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If during erection he appears circumcised, this is fine; if not, [mid'Rabanan] we must cut away the flesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> If a child is fleshy - if during erection he appears uncircumcised, we must cut the flesh; if not, not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between Shmuel and R. Shimon ben Gamliel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about if [during erection] he appears partially circumcised [some of the crown is covered - Shmuel requires cutting more, R. Shimon does not].</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>BERACHOS ON MILAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he circumcised but did not expose the Milah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who circumcises blesses 'Asher Kidshanu b'Mitzvosav v'Tzivanu Al ha'Milah'; the baby's father blesses '...v'Tzivanu Lehachniso bi'Vriso Shel Avraham Avinu";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Everyone present says 'Just like he entered the Bris, he should progress to Torah, marriage and good deeds!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Someone (it need not be the Mohel or father) blesses 'Asher Kidesh Yedid mi'Beten...Baruch Atah Hash-m Kores ha'Bris.''</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>One who circumcises a convert blesses 'Asher Kidshanu b'Mitzvosav v'Tzivanu Al ha'Milah'; someone blesses '...v'Tzivanu Lamul Es ha'Gerim u'Lehatif Mehem Dam Bris'; if not for Dam Bris, Shomayim and Aretz would not endure - "Im Lo Vrisi Yomam va'Laylah Chukos Shomayim va'Aretz Lo Samti"; Baruch Atah Hash-m Kores ha'Bris.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>One who circumcises a slave blesses '...v'Tzivanu Al ha'Milah'; someone blesses '...v'Tzivanu Lamul Es ha'Avadim u'Lehatif Mehem Dam Bris'; if not for Dam Bris...; Baruch Atah Hash-m Kores ha'Bris.'</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>HANGING A <i>MESHAMERES</i> ON SHABBOS AND YOM TOV</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> One may hang a Meshameres (a cloth through which wine is strained) on Yom Tov; one may strain wine through a hanging Meshameres on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim forbid both of these - however, one may strain wine through a hanging Meshameres on Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> R. Eliezer does not even allow adding onto a temporary Ohel (roof) - how can he permit [hanging a Meshameres, and] making an Ohel from the beginning?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where do we find that R. Eliezer forbids adding onto a temporary Ohel?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If a window stopper is tied and hangs [above the ground], one may use it to close a window; if not, not</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, in either case one may use it to close.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> All agree that one may not make a new temporary Ohel on Yom Tov, there is no need to say it is forbidden on Shabbos - they argue about adding to an Ohel:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Eliezer forbids adding on Yom Tov, there is no need to say that he forbids on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim permit adding on Shabbos, there is no need to say that they permit on Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer holds like R. Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The only difference between Yom Tov and Shabbos is preparation of food;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, also Machshirei Ochel Nefesh (even though they are forbidden on Shabbos, they are permitted on Yom Tov).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah permits only Machshirim that cannot be done before Yom Tov - the Meshameres could be hung beforehand!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer is more lenient than R. Yehudah (he permits even Machshirim that could be done beforehand)!</p>
