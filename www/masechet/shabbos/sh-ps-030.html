<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>EXTINGUISHING A LAMP FOR A <i>CHOLEH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven extinguished a Ner because he fears that Nochrim or bandits will see it [and harm him], because the light depresses him, or to enable a Choleh (sick person) to sleep, he is exempt (the entire Mishnah will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he extinguished to save the Ner [from breaking], to save oil or the wick, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi exempts in every case, except for saving the wick, for he makes a singed wick (which lights better).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The middle clause obligates [for Melachah she'Einah Tzerichah l'Gufah, i.e. it does not bring benefit (Tosfos - like in the Mishkan)], like R. Yehudah - what is the case in the Reisha?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Choleh is in mortal danger, it should not say 'exempt' (implying that it is forbidden), it is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he is not in mortal danger, Reuven is Chayav Chatas!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, he is in mortal danger, it should say 'permitted' - it says 'exempt' for parallel structure with the Seifa, which says 'Chayav'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we explain the following Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya - Beraisa):</span> It is forbidden to extinguish a Ner to enable a Choleh to sleep; if one did so, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, there is no mortal danger; it is like R. Shimon [who exempts Melachah she'Einah Tzerichah l'Gufah].</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DO THE DEAD TRANSCEND THE LIVING?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (to R. Tanchum of Noy):</span> May one extinguish a Ner to enable a Choleh to sleep? (He prefaced his answer with a related Agadata.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (R. Tanchum):</span> How do we understand the words of Shlomo, the greatest Chacham - not only do they contradict the words of David, they are self-contradictory!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>David said "Lo ha'Mesim Yehalelu Kah"; Shlomo said "V'Shabe'ach Ani Es ha'Mesim [...Min ha'Chayim]", but also said "L'Chelev Chai Hu Tov Min ha'Arye ha'Mes"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> David arouses one to glorify Hash-m by engaging in Torah and Mitzvos while he is alive, for he cannot do so after death;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Ba'Mesim Chofshi" - once someone dies, he is exempt from Torah and Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Shlomo said "V'Shabe'ach Ani Es ha'Mesim", for the Zechus of the Avos helped where Moshe's Zechus did not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Moshe said many prayers to save Yisrael after Chet ha'Egel, but was not answered until he said 'Zechor l'Avraham l'Yitzchak and ul'Yisrael Avadecha".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Another supremacy of the dead - normally, a mortal officer decrees, people might or might not fulfill it; even if they do, this is only during his life, not after his death;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Another supremacy is like Rav Yehudah taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yehudah):</span> What does it mean "Ase Imi Os l'Tovah v'Yir'u Son'ai v'Yevoshu"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> David asked forgiveness for his sin [with Bas Sheva] - Hash-m granted it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> In my lifetime, give me a sign that you forgave me!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> I will not do this in your life, only in the life of your son Shlomo;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>When Shlomo built the Beis ha'Mikdash and wanted to bring the Aron into the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim, the gates clung to each other and would not let it enter. Shlomo sang 24 praises to Hash-m, they remained closed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>He said "Se'u She'arim Rosheichem...v'Yavo Melech ha'Havod", they thought that he referred to himself, they sought to swallow him - 'Who is the King of honor?'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Shlomo:</span> "Hash-m Izuz v'Gibor; Se'u She'arim Rosheichem...v'Yavo Melech ha'Havod...Hash-m Tzevakos Hu Melech ha'Havod". The gates remained closed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>When he said "Zochrah l'Chasdei David Avdecha", they opened; the faces of David's enemies turned black (from shame), all knew that Hash-m forgave David.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>This explains why it says [after the celebration over Binyan Beis ha'Mikdash] "...Va'Yelchu l'Ohaleichem Semechim v'Tovei Lev Al Kol ha'Tovah Asher Asah Hash-m l'David Avdo ul'Yisrael Amo";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Va'Yelchu l'Ohaleichem" - everyone found his wife Tehorah; "Semechim" - because they enjoyed the radiance of the Shechinah; "v'Tovei Lev" - everyone's wife became pregnant and gave birth to a son; "ha'Tovah Asher Asah Hash-m l'David" - he forgave him for the sin; "ul'Yisrael Amo" - he forgave Yisrael for [feasting on] Yom Kipur [during the celebration].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Another teaching of Rav Yehudah explains "L'Chelev Chai Hu Tov Min ha'Arye ha'Mes":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "Hodi'eni Hash-m Kitzi..." - David asked to know how long he will live.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> I decreed that a person will not know this (so he will constantly repent)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> "U'Midas Yamai Mah Hi ..." - which day of the year will I die? (Maharsha - he would still be motivated to repent every year. Rashi - the first question was, what will happen to him in the rest of his life; this question was how long he will live.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> I decreed that a person will not know this (so he will repent every day)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> "Ed'ah Meh Chadel Ani"  - David asked to know which day of the week he will die.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> You will die on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> May I live another day, and die on Sunday (so people can take care of my body and eulogize me)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> The reign of your son Shlomo must begin that Shabbos, a king cannot usurp a moment of the reign destined for another king.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> May I die the day before, on Erev Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> [I do not desire this -] "Ki Tov Yom ba'Chatzerecha me'Elef", the Torah you learn each day is dearer to me than 1000 Olos that Shlomo will offer to me on the Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">30b----------------------------------------30b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span>Every Shabbos David would learn Torah the entire day (the Satan (angel of death) cannot kill one who is learning). The Shabbos he was due to die came; the Satan was unable to do anything, for he did not cease learning. David had an orchard in back of his house; the Satan made the trees move, David went to see what was happening. When he was ascending steps, the Satan removed a step; David ceased learning, and died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">Shlomo asked Chachamim:</span> My father is dead, in the sun [perhaps the body will rot], and his dogs are hungry - what should I do?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Cut up a Nevelah for the dogs to eat; put a loaf or child on top of your father, you may move his body together with the loaf or child. (Ben Yehoyada - this is a parable through which Shlomo asked, people used to taunt my father about the episode with Bas Sheva, he humbly bore their insults - if I do not nothing, they will speak more, now that he is dead! Chachamim told him to kill them, and publicly justify his father (prove that Bas Sheva was already divorced).)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span>Regarding this Shlomo said "L'Chelev Chai Hu Tov Min ha'Arye ha'Mes" (the dogs could be fed normally, David's body could not be moved normally (by itself, it is Muktzeh); alternatively, they answered about the dogs before about David</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to Question (h) - R. Tanchum):</span> A lamp is called Ner, just like a Neshamah ("Ner Hash-m Nishmas Adam)" - it is better to extinguish a mortal's Ner to preserve the Ner of Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OTHER TEACHINGS OF <i>KOHELES</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah brei d'Rav Shmuel):</span> Chachamim sought to bury Sefer Koheles, because of the [seeming] contradictions in it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't they bury it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They did not because it begins and ends with Divrei Torah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Near the beginning it says "Mah Yisron la'Adam b'Chol Amalo Tachas ha'Shemesh";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(D'vei R. Yanai):</span> Nothing is gained through toil under the sun, but there is gain in what preceded the sun (Torah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The end says "Sof Davar ha'Kol Nishma Es ha'Elokim Yera v'Es Mitzvosav Shemor Ki Zeh Kol ha'Adam";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "Ki Zeh Kol ha'Adam"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> The entire world was created only for this (fearing Hash-m and doing his Mitzvos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Aba bar Kahana):</span> This is worth as much as the entire world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ben Azai):</span> The entire world was created to be company for one who fulfills this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What contradictions are in Koheles?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer - Contradiction #1:</span> It says "Tov Ka'as mi'Sechok" (even anger is better than laughter), and it says "Li'Schok Amarti Mehulal" (it is praiseworthy)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction #2:</span> It says " V'Shibachti Ani Es ha'Simchah" and it says "Ul'Simchah Mah Zo Osah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to Contradiction #1):</span> The anger that Hash-m has against Tzadikim [to punish them] in this world is better than His laughter with the Resha'im in this world (they are rewarded for their Mitzvos here, and get no share in the world to come);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Sechok Hash-m will have with Tzadikim in the world to come is praiseworthy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to Contradiction #2):</span> Shlomo lauds the Simchah one has in a Mitzvah (Rashi - Simchah that is itself a Mitzvah, e.g. to gladden a Chasan and Kalah), but sees no value in other Simchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>We learn from that the Shechinah does not rest [on a person] amidst sadness, laziness, Sechol, lightheadedness, conversation or idle words, only amidst Simchah of a Mitzvah - "V'Hayah k'Nagen ha'Menagen va'Tehi Alav Ru'ach Hash-m".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Similarly, one must learn Halachah amidst Simchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Similarly, going to sleep amidst Simchah will cause good dreams.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rav Gidal taught that if a Talmid learns from his Rebbi and his lips are not dripping with bitterness [on account of awe], his lips should be burned!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "Sifsosav Shoshanim Notfos Mor Over" - we read this 'she'Shonim Notfos Mar' (lips that are learning drip with bitterness).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Rebbi should be amidst Simchah, the Talmidim must be in awe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Rebbi should begin amidst Simchah, afterwards he must be in awe.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rabah would begin with something amusing to make the Talmidim jovial - afterwards he would teach amidst awe.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>They also sought to bury Sefer Mishlei, because of the [seeming] contradictions in it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't they bury it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They said, just like we investigated and resolved the contradictions in Koheles, we can do the same for Mishlei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are contradictions in Mishlei?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer - contradiction:</span> It says "Al Ta'an Kesil k'Ivalto", and it says "Ane Chesil k'Ivalto"!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rebbi offered him wine; he drank and died. (Iyun Yakov - one who blemishes others, he himself has that blemish - the man was a Mamzer, [unknown] Mamzerim do not live (lest people marry them). Maharshal - some say, he intended for "Im Ra'ev Sona'acha...Hashkehu" (Mishlei 25:21); Maharal - a Tzadik humbling himself in front of a Rasha is called giving him to drink, it is like poison for the Rasha.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>A man came in front of R. Chiya (text of Ein Yakov - Rebbi) and said 'Your mother is my wife, your are my son (you are a Mamzer). R. Chiya offered him wine; he drank and died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> Rebbi's prayer helped prevent him from being considered a Mamzer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi used to pray 'May it be Your will to save me today from brazen people and from [accusations of] brazenness (i.e. that I am a Mamzer).'</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Gamliel was teaching that in the future, women will give birth every day - "Harah v'Yoledes Yachdav".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Talmid mocked this - "V'Ein Kol Chadash Tachas ha'Shamesh" (nothing ever changes)!</p>
