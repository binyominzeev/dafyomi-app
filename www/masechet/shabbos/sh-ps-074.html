<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Winnowing, Borer, grinding, sifting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Winnowing, Borer and sifting are all the same (removing the undesired part)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye and Rava):</span> Every labor done to build the Mishkan is listed [as an Av Melachah by itself], even if some of them are very similar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also pounding should be listed (even though it is like threshing, for spices were pounded)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> [The Tana begins by listing the Melachos used to make bread -] because an Oni does not pound [to make high quantity flour], it was excluded.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Our Mishnah is Rebbi, who expounds that there are 39 Melachos - if we would include pounding, there would be 40.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, he should include pounding (with threshing) and exclude winnowing, Borer or sifting [to teach two of each grouping of similar Melachos, instead of one of these and all three of those]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must answer like Abaye.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN IS SELECTING PERMITTED ON SHABBOS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one had several kinds of food in front of himself, he selects and eats, he selects and leaves over, he may not select; if he selected, he is Chayav Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula):</span> He selects [for himself] to eat today; he selects and leaves over, [for others to eat] today; he may not select for tomorrow - if he did, he is Chayav Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Chisda):</span> It is forbidden to bake or cook [or do any other Melachah, including Borer] to eat that day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Chisda):</span> He selects less than a Shi'ur (k'Grogeres), and eats; he selects less than a Shi'ur and leaves over; he may not select a Shi'ur - if he did, he is Chayav Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> It is forbidden to bake [or do any other Melachah, including Borer] less than a Shi'ur!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Yosef):</span> He selects by hand, and eats; he selects by hand, and leaves over; he may not select using a funnel or plate - if he did, he is exempt [for these are not special for Breirah]; he may not select using a sieve; - if he did, he is Chayav Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Hamnuna):</span> The Beraisa does not mention a funnel or plate!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Hamnuna):</span> He selects the food from the Pesoles (waste, what he does not desire), and eats; he selects food from the Pesoles, and leaves over; he may not select Pesoles from the food - if he did, he is Chayav Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> The Beraisa does not mention selecting food from the Pesoles!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Abaye):</span> He selects [for himself] to eat immediately; he selects and leaves over, [for others to eat] immediately; he may not select for later in the day; if he did, this is like selecting to store up, he is Chayav Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava approved of Abaye's answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi - Beraisa #1):</span> If there were two kinds of food, and one selected one of them [for himself] to eat or to leave [for others to eat], he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah mi'Difti):</span> The text says 'He is liable.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Ashi - Beraisa #2):</span> He is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beraisa #1 discusses selecting with a funnel or plate, Beraisa #2 discusses selecting with a sieve. (Rashi - Beraisa #2 is the above Beraisa (a); Tosfos - it must be another Beraisa, since Beraisa (a) permits in one case, and Breirah is never permitted with a sieve.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rav Dimi:</span> Rav Bivi was serving the Talmidim on Shabbos - he dumped out a basket of fruit in front of R. Ami and R. Asi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I do not know if he did so because he holds that it is forbidden to select food from Pesoles (the fruits from the leaves - dumping out the basket caused them to separate by themselves), or if he did so just to be generous.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> If one selects lupines from their Pesoles, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He holds that it is forbidden to select food from Pesoles!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, lupines are different, for one cooks them seven times;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">74b----------------------------------------74b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> If the Pesoles is not removed (some texts - if they are not cooked), they will spoil, therefore we [are stringent to] consider the lupines themselves like Pesoles, it is like Pesoles from food.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Mishnah Berurah):</span> Before they have been cooked seven times, they are bitterer than the Pesoles, therefore it is like Pesoles from food.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>EXAMPLES OF <i>CHIYUVIM</i> FOR <i>MELACHOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Grinding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If one dices beets, he is liable for grinding. (R. Chananel explains, he cut very finely, as if they were mashed; Aruch - some say, even if he cuts into large pieces. Rashba - it was not for immediate consumption; Tosfos - other vegetables are permitted; Rosh - Rav Papa discusses wood, but grinding a food [that is ready to be eaten] is permitted.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Menasheh):</span> If one chops wood finely for kindling, he is liable for grinding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> If he is particular about their length, he is liable for cutting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kneading and baking.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Our Tana lists baking, and not cooking, even though they cooked spices for the Mishkan - he lists the Melachos used to make bread. (In any case, one who cooks is liable for baking. Rashi - baking was not done <i>to build</i> the Mishkan (kneading is an Av because ingredients were kneaded with water in order to make dye). R. Tam (in Tosfos ha'Rosh 74A she'Chen) - they baked bread for the sake of testing Techeiles, cooking was far more important; Rav Hai Gaon - we learn Avos also from Melachos done for the sake of Menachos - see Rashi on the Mishnah 92A.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Rav Avira):</span> One who puts a wet peg into an oven to dry is liable for cooking.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he intends only to harden it - Rav Acha teaches, this is not so, he intends to soften it first [and one is liable for this], then it hardens.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> If one melts pitch he is liable for cooking,</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he is exempt because it hardens later - Rabah teaches, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one makes a barrel, he is liable seven Chata'os (for grinding clumps of dirt very finely, Borer (removing the big pebbles), sifting the dirt in a sifter, kneading it, smoothing it (Memachek), burning [to heat the furnace] and solidifying it (cooking));</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>He is liable eight Chata'os for making an oven (the above seven, and Makeh b'Patish, i.e. smearing plaster on it so it will hold the heat).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If one makes a chest of reeds, he is liable 11 Chata'os (two for pruning the reeds (reaping and planting), for gathering, selecting the nice ones, smoothing them, cutting each into two or three thin slices (grinding), cutting them to size (Mechatech), Meisach of the warp reeds (arranging them so the woof can be intertwined), intertwining a woof reed over and under the warp, so it will stay - this is like making two Batei Nirin, weaving, cutting off the excess after weaving (Makeh b'Patish);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he sewed an opening, he is liable another two (Rashi - he must tie it; Tosfos - he is liable for building a Kli).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>PLUCKING HAIR OR FEATHERS FROM ANIMALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Shearing wool and laundering it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> One who spins wool [still] on a sheep on Shabbos is Chayav three Chata'os - for shearing, Menapetz and spinning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> He is exempt - this is not the normal way to do any of these!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Nechemyah):</span> They washed [the hair while it was still] on the goats and they spun on the goats.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that it is normal (and thus within the category of spinning)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No - it was done through extra Chachmah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one plucked a feather from a bird's wing, cut off the [soft] end, then cut the hair off the other end, he must bring three Chata'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Plucking is liable for shearing, cutting off the end is liable for Mechatech, cutting the hair is liable for Memachek (smoothing).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><i>MELACHOS</i> INVOLVING ROPES AND THREADS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Tying, untying...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did they tie for the Mishkan?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> They would tie [the curtains] to pegs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That tying was with intent to untie (one is liable only for a permanent knot)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> If a thread [for the curtains] broke, they would tie it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> That explains tying - what did they untie for the Mishkan?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If a thread tore [and was tied] in two places [near each other], they would untie the knots and [pull the ends together and] make one knot (Tosfos (73A); Rashi - if two threads near each other tore [and were tied], they would untie one of them [after weaving, to avoid two bulges near each other. According to this (but not according to Tosfos), one is liable for untying even without intent to tie.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is unfit even for a mortal king, all the more so for Hash-m! (Rashi - the threads were six-fold, hence very thick, so the hole would be conspicuous - rather, on one torn thread they would tear a fair distance above and below the knot, and tie a thread to each torn end - this way, no two knots were near each other.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #3 to Question (i) - Rava):</span> They would tie and untie knots in nets to trap the Chilazon (the fish whose blood is used to make Techeiles).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Sewing two stitches.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Two stitches will come apart (anything that will not last is not a Melachah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> He is liable only if he tied them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Tearing in order to sew.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did they tear for the Mishkan?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah and R. Zeira):</span> If worms made a hole in a curtain, they would tear around the hole and sew it up (Rashi; Tosfos - they would tear off the whole curtain [which was sewn to other curtains] and replace it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra bar Tuvya citing Rav):</span> If parts of a garment are joined by a sewn thread which is not taut, and one pulls it taut [making the ends of the garment come together], he is liable for sewing;</p>
