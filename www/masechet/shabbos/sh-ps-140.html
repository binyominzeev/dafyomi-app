<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FOODS THAT REQUIRE A <i>SHINUY</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may put an egg in a mustard strainer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Yakov Korchah - Beraisa):</span> This is permitted because it is done only for color (one desires the yolk for its color, but the white is not Pesoles).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If mustard was kneaded before Shabbos, one may dissolve it [in water or wine] on Shabbos with a Kli (this is a Shinuy), but not with his hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Shmuel):</span> People normally use a Kli!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, on Shabbos, one may use his hand, but not a Kli.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Both of these are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Both of these are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye and Rava):</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Yochanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yochanan retracted and adopted R. Elazar's opinion; R. Elazar retracted and adopted Shmuel's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye and Rava):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yochanan [after he retracted].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Abaye's mother did this for him - he did not eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Ze'iri's wife did this for R. Chiya bar Ashi - he did not eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Ze'iri's wife:</span> I do this for your Rebbi (Ze'iri) and he eats it - you will not?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rava bar Sheva:</span> They mixed mustard for Ravina using the middle of a garlic; he ate it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> The Halachah does not follow any of these teachings, rather, like the following:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If mustard was kneaded before Shabbos, one may dissolve it on Shabbos with his hand or a Kli; he may put in honey;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He may not beat it, he just mixes it [gently].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If cress was beaten before Shabbos, on Shabbos one may add oil and vinegar and Amisa (this will be defined);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He may not beat it, he just mixes it [gently].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>If garlic was diced before Shabbos, on Shabbos one may add beans and grits;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>He may not crush it, but he mixes it [gently] and adds Amisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Amisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is mint.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This teaches that mint improves cress.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may make Anomalin on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may make Anomalin on Shabbos (it is a normal beverage), but not Aluntis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Anomalin is a drink composed of wine, honey and peppers; Aluntis is composed of old wine, clear water and balsam [oil] - people drink it after a steambath, to cool off (this is like for a cure, therefore it is forbidden on Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I once entered the bathhouse after Mar Ukva; after we left, they gave us a cup of Aluntis to drink, I was chilled from head to toe;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had I drank another, (Rashi - I would have needed a miracle to survive; Maharshal - I would have enjoyed it so much) it could have reduced my merits for the world to come!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Mar Ukva drinks this every day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he is used to it, it does not affect him so much.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CHILTIS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [On Shabbos] we may not soak Chiltis (a plant whose leaves are used as a spice, it is soaked and used for medicinal purposes) in lukewarm water, but we may put it in vinegar;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We do not put water on vetch (it is usually used for animal food) to remove the Pesoles, nor do we rub it, but we may put it in a sieve or basket.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We do not sift straw in a sieve, nor do we put it in a high place in order that the chaff will fall - but one may take it in a sieve to put in the feeding trough.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> If one soaked Chiltis, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ada Narsha'ah):</span> He is Chayav Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> If so, also one who soaked meat should be Chayav Chatas!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> It is forbidden only mid'Rabanan, for this is like one does on a weekday.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> May one soak Chiltis in cold water?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yanai):</span> It is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> The Mishnah forbids in lukewarm water - this implies that it is permitted in cold water!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yanai):</span> If we simply follow the Mishnah, there is no difference between me (the Rebbi) and you (the Talmid)! Our Mishnah is an individual's opinion:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not soak Chiltis in hot or cold water;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi forbids in hot water and permits in cold water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is soaked Chiltis used for?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is for one whose heart is heavy (heartburn?).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Rav Acha bar Yosef's heart was heavy; Mar Ukva told him to drink the weight of three gold coins of Chiltis for three days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>He drank on Thursday and Erev Shabbos; on Shabbos he went to the Beis Medrash to ask [if it is permitted on Shabbos].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Tana d'vei Rav Ada - Beraisa):</span> One may drink a Kav (about two liters) or two [of Chiltis on Shabbos], this is no problem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rav Acha:</span> I know that one may drink it - my question is whether or not one may soak it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> A case occurred - Rav Ada bar Ahavah did not know, Rav Huna permitted to soak in cold water and put it in the sun.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this like the opinion (R. Yosi) who permits?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No - even Chachamim permit when he already drank it the previous two days, for it would be dangerous not to drink it on the third day.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TAKING CARE OF GARMENTS ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha bar Yosef):</span> May one rub a [hard, laundered] linen garment (to soften it; this also makes it whiter)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Safra):</span> It is permitted, because he intends to soften it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak:</span> Why didn't you ask about a turban?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Acha:</span> I already asked Rav Huna (he permitted it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak:</span> You should have been able to derive that also a linen garment is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Acha:</span> A linen garment gets whiter, a turban does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> [On Shabbos] one may take a linen garment off a rod on which it was hanging [to dry], but one may not remove the rod (it is Muktzeh).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">140b----------------------------------------140b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If it was hanging on a weaver's rod, one may even remove the rod (it is a Kli).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If a bundle of vegetables (Aruch - palm leaves) is fitting for an animal to eat, one may move it; if not, not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Ashi):</span> One may move salted meat hanging to dry, but not salted fish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Katina):</span> If one stands in the middle of a bed [that a man and his wife normally sleep on,] this is [prone to arouse lust,] like standing on her stomach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>This is not true.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>RAV CHISDA'S ECONOMICAL TIPS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> When a Talmid buys a bundle of vegetables, he should buy a long bundle, since all cost the same, he gains the extra length.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> When a Talmid buys a bundle of sticks, he should buy a long bundle, since all cost the same.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> A Talmid [that has a meager amount of bread - some delete this from the text] should not eat [raw] vegetables, for this arouses appetite.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> I did not eat vegetables when I was poor, for this arouses appetite;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I do not eat after I became rich, for it is better to eat meat and fish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> A Talmid that has a meager amount of bread should not eat a little at a time, for this does not satiate (rather, he should gather enough and eat a proper meal).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> A Talmid that has a meager amount of bread should not [bless ha'Motzi and] cut the bread [and distribute pieces to everyone else], for he will not give generously.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> Before I became rich, I would not cut the bread until I felt around the bread basket and knew that there was enough for me.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> If someone could eat barley bread and eats wheat bread [it is more expensive], he transgresses 'Bal Tashchis (wasting money)'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> If someone could drink beer and drinks wine, he transgresses Bal Tashchis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>This is wrong - it is more important not to harm one's body (wheat and wine are healthier).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If a Talmid lacks oil, he should wash his hands [before Birkas ha'Mazon], in a pond in which algae grows (it is a good substitute).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> When a Talmid buys meat, he should buy the neck, for it contains three kinds of meat - fatty, lean and sinew.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> When a Talmid buys flax, he should buy from the Aba river and soak it for 30 days - I will be a guarantor that it will last 12 months.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The word Kitunisa (linen garment) is like Kisa Na'eh (it puts its owner in an elite Kas (caste)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> A Talmid should not sit on a new mattress of moist reeds, for this is bad for his clothes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> A Talmid should not ask his innkeeper to launder his clothes, lest she will see semen, and he will be disgraced in her eyes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda (to his daughters):</span> Act modestly in front of your husbands - do not eat bread in front of them (lest you will eat a lot), do not eat vegetables at night (it causes bad breath), do not eat dates or drink beer at night (they cause gas), do not relieve yourselves in the same place as your husbands;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When someone is at the door, ask <i>in the feminine</i> 'Who is it', not in the masculine (minimize speaking with men);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When with your husband, delay relations until his desire is great.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not put water on vetch [but we may put it in a sieve].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Our Mishnah is unlike the following Tana:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> One may not use a sieve at all [on Shabbos].</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>FEEDING ANIMALS ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Dosa):</span> One may sweep in front of a Petem (an animal being fattened, so its food will not get mixed with dirt) and remove [extra] food to the side so it will not get sullied with excrement;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim forbid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One may take food from in front of one animal and put it in front of another animal on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Do Chachamim argue with the first law (sweeping in front of a Petem, for he evens out holes in the floor) or with the latter (removing extra food, since it was already trampled and animals will not eat it)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Chachamim):</span> The law of both of these is the same - one may not clear the food to the side (they argue about both laws).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> They argue about a feeding trough with a dirt floor - if it is a Kli, all permit sweeping.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> No one would permit sweeping a dirt floor - he evens out holes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Chisda):</span> They argue about a Kli - if it is a dirt floor, all forbid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may take food from in front of one animal...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> One may take food from in front of an animal with a good mouth and put it in front of an animal with a bad mouth (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> One may take food from an animal with a bad mouth and put it by one with a good mouth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Resolution (Abaye):</span> Both of them permit taking from a donkey to an ox, and forbid vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beraisa #1 calls a donkey 'good mouthed' because it does not drool into its food, a cow is 'bad mouthed' because it drools into its food;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beraisa #2 calls a donkey 'bad mouthed' because it is not picky about its food, a cow is 'good mouthed' because it is picky.</p>
