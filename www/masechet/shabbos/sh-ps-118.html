<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHOSE OPINION IS REFLECTED IN THE MISHNAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the fire was on Shabbos night, one may save three meals.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It was before eating the evening meal (it is like Chachamim, who say that one eats three meals on Shabbos)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it was after eating (it is like R. Chidka, who says that one eats three meals after the evening meal)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the fire was on Shabbos morning, one may save two meals.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It was before eating (it is like Chachamim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it was after eating.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the fire was on Shabbos afternoon, one may save one meal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It was before eating.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it was after eating.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa - R. Yosi):</span> No matter when it was, one may save three meals.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This implies that the first Tana agrees that we eat three meals on Shabbos (but he only allows saving for remaining meals)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Our Mishnah is unlike R. Chidka.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> One who has food for two meals may not take from the Tamchuy (food that is collected and distributed daily to the poor), one who has food for 14 meals may not take from the Kupah (money collected and distributed weekly to those ashamed to take from the Tamchuy).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not like either Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim hold that one eats 15 meals each week [two each weekday, and three on Shabbos], R. Chidka adds one more, i.e. 16!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Really, it is like Chachamim - the third Shabbos meal is eaten [shortly before evening,] in place of what the Oni would normally eat at night on Motzei Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is like Chachamim, it is unlike R. Chidka!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection and Answer #2:</span> It can even be like R. Chidka - [also] the Shabbos night meal is in place of what the Oni would normally eat during the day on Erev Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is unreasonable to require him to fast [any day, but especially] Erev Shabbos! (Ta'anis 26A - Ma'amados do not fast on Erev Shabbos, because it is dangerous.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> It is like R. Akiva, who says that it is better to conduct on Shabbos like on a weekday [and have only two meals] than to (Mishnah Berurah 242:1 - begin to) receive Tzedakah. (Regarding Shabbos meals, it can be like Chachamim or R. Chidka.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an Oni passes through a city, we do not give less than a loaf bought for a Pundiyon (a 12th of a Dinar) when four Sa'im of wheat sell for a Sela (four Dinarim. It follows that a Pundiyon buys a 12th of a Se'ah, i.e. the volume of 12 eggs. A Pundiyon buys a loaf the size of six eggs, for half the price is for firewood and the baker's labor. The loaf is for the two meals he eats in one day).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he will stay for the night, we provide what he needs for the night;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is Shabbos, we give him food for three meals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is like Chachamim, it is unlike R. Chidka!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is even like R. Chidka - the case is, he already has a meal with him, he will eat it for the fourth Shabbos meal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Will we send him away with nothing?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We give him a meal when he leaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are 'needs for the night'? (We give a night meal even if he will not stay!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a bed and felt to put under his head.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE REWARD FOR HONORING SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may wash bowls that he ate in on Shabbos night for the sake of Shabbos morning; one may wash bowls used Shabbos morning for the sake of Shabbos afternoon;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may not wash [on Shabbos] bowls used Shabbos afternoon [since he will not eat another meal on Shabbos];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One may wash cups, jugs and flasks at any time, for one does not fix times for drinking.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> The three Shabbos meals are learned from three times it says "Yom"; one who fulfills them is saved from three harsh "Yomim" - the birth pangs of Moshi'ach, judgment in Gehinom, and the war of Gog and Magog:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding birth pangs of Moshi'ach it says "Hine Anochi Shole'ach Lachem Es Eliyahu ha'Navi Lifnei Bo Yom Hash-m"; we learn from there to judgment in Gehinom and to the war of Gog and Magog, about which it also says "Yom" - "Yom Evrah ha'Yom ha'Hu", "B'Yom Bo Gog"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Anyone who makes Shabbos a delight receives an inheritance without boundaries - "Az Tis'anag Al Hash-m...v'Ha'achalticha Nachalas Yakov" (Beis Yosef - this is Midah k'Neged Midah, for spending to honor Shabbos without limit);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">118b----------------------------------------118b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is not like the [limited] inheritance promised to Avraham, "Kum His'halech ba'Aretz l'Arkah [ul'Rachbah]", or that promised to Yitzchak, "Ki Lecha ul'Zar'acha Eten Es Kol ha'Aratzos ha'El";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, it is like what was promised to Yakov, "U'Foratzta Yamah va'Kedmah v'Tzafonah va'Negbah".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> He is saved from servitude in Galus - "V'Atah Al Bamoseimu Sidroch".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> He is given his heart's desires - " V'His'anag Al Hash-m va'Yiten Lecha Mish'alos Libecha";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What 'Oneg' does the verse discuss ("V'His'anag")?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Korasa la'Shabos Oneg".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does one makes Shabbos a delight?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah bar Shmuel):</span> One eats a dish of spinach, big fish and heads of garlic (these were prestigious foods).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Ashi):</span> Even a small matter for the honor of Shabbos fulfills Oneg.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this small matter?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> It is fish fried in its own oil with flour.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Anyone who guards Shabbos properly, even if he serves idolatry like the generation of Enosh, he will be forgiven - "Ashrei Enosh Ya'aseh Zos...[Shomer Shabos] <i>me'Chalelo</i>" - we read this 'Machul Lo' (he is forgiven).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Had [all of] Yisrael observed the first Shabbos, no nation could have ruled over them - it says "Va'Yhi ba'Yom ha'Shevi'i Yotz'u Min ha'Am Lilkot", and afterwards "Va'Yavo Amalek". (Tosfos 87B asks, this was not the first Shabbos - Hash-m commanded them about Shabbos in Marah, the Man fell more than a week later! Tosfos ha'Rosh - Moshe did not tell Yisrael until the Man fell, it was the first Shabbos after Yisrael were commanded.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If Yisrael would observe two Shabbosos properly, they would be redeemed immediately - it says "Asher Yishmeru Es Shabsosai", and shortly afterwards it says "Va'Havi'osim El Har Kodshi". (Tosfos Nidah 13A - there is a storehouse of Neshamos that must be born before the redemption - women would have multiple births to fulfill this speedily.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> May my portion be among those who eat three meals on Shabbos! (He said this because people do not realize how important it is.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>R. YOSI'S DICTUMS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> May my portion be among those who finish Hallel every day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it was taught that one who says Hallel every day blasphemes! (Rashi - Hallel was enacted to thank Hash-m at certain times - if one says it every day, it is a mere song! Maharsha - the enactment was to publicize Hash-m's miracles done at certain times - if one says it every day, he does not publicize these miracles - it is as if he denies Hash-m's ability.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi refers to those who say two psalms of praise in Pesukei d'Zimra ("Halelu Es Hash-m Min ha'Shomayim..." and "Halelu Kel b'Kodsho").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> May my portion be among those who pray when the sun is red (Shacharis at sunrise, and Minchah at sunset)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> It is a Mitzvah to pray when the sun is red.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> He learns from "Yira'ucha Im Shamesh v'Lifnei Yare'ach Dor Dorim".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> May my portion be among those who die from intestinal sickness (the pain atones for transgressions).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It was taught that most Tzadikim die from intestinal sickness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> May my portion be among those who die on the way to a Mitzvah (Maharsha - at the time of doing a Mitzvah - Sheluchei Mitzvah are not harmed on account of engaging in the Mitzvah, but there is no blanket protection from any harm at the time).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> May my portion be among those who bring in Shabbos early in Tiverya (it is in a valley, it gets dark very early), and those who end Shabbos late in Tzipori (it is elevated, and it is very late when it gets dark)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> May my portion be among Moshivei Beis ha'Medrash (Rashi - those who arouse Talmidim to come; Maharsha - those who sit, they are not quick to leave), not among Ma'amidei Beis ha'Medrash (those who tell them to leave [to eat]; Maharsha - those who stand).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> May my portion be among those who collect Tzedakah (one who causes others to give is greater than one who gives - Bava Basra 9A), not among those who distribute Tzedakah (it is hard to know how much to give to each Oni).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> May my portion be among those who are wrongly suspected of transgressing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> People wrongly suspected me.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> I did five Bi'os (acts of relations), producing five great Chachamim in Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who are they?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi, R. Elazar b'Rebbi Yosi, R. Chalafta b'Rebbi Yosi, R, Avtilas b'Rebbi Yosi and R. Menachem b'Rebbi Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There was also Vardimus!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Vardimus is Menachem - he is called Vardimus because his face was [pink] like Varad (a rose).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [Surely, 'I did five Bi'os' teaches that he had relations only five times, and each resulted in a Chacham -] did R. Yosi not fulfill the Mitzvah of Onah (having relations with his wives regularly)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, five times he did Bi'ah and repeated the act [to help cause the children to be males].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> I always call my wife 'my house' (she conducts the whole house), I always call my ox 'my field' (the produce is due to its strength).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> I never looked at my Milah (Ever).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rebbi [Yehudah ha'Nasi] was called Rabbeinu ha'Kodesh because he never looked at his Milah - R. Yosi should have also received this title!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi had another attribute - he never put his hands below his belt (to distance himself from things that arouse lust).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> The rafters of my house never saw the fringes of my garment (he would remove it only under a sheet, for Tzeni'us).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> I never transgressed the words of my colleagues:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I know that I am not a Kohen - nevertheless, if they would tell me go to the Duchan [at the time of] Birkas Kohanim, I would go! (Maharsha - he would ascend the Duchan, but he would not say the Berachos, a Yisrael is forbidden to do so. Tosfos ha'Rosh - this is just a parable for how far he would go to comply.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> I never said something and retracted [when the one I spoke about came. Alternatively - I never said something and turned around to see if the one I spoke about was there. Maharsha - R. Yosi permits statements like, "There is fire in Ploni's house" - surely, if Ploni was there, it was not said in a negative way.]</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>MITZVOS</i> THAT THE <i>CHACHAMIM</i> WERE ESPECIALLY CAREFUL ABOUT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> I will receive (Rashi - reward; Maharsha - help from Hash-m) for fulfilling three meals on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> I will receive for concentration in prayer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> I will receive for not going four Amos with my head exposed. (Maharshal (Teshuvah 72) - this shows that this is only Midas Chasidus. Taz (O.C. 8:3) - now that baring the head is a Nochri rite, it is letter of the law.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> I will receive for fulfilling the Mitzvah of Tefilin (not going four Amos without them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> I will receive for fulfilling the Mitzvah of Tzitzis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef (to Rabah's son):</span> What was your father most careful about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rabah's son:</span> He was very careful about Tzitzis - once he was ascending a ladder, and his Tzitzis snapped - he did not descend until he put in a new thread to fix it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> I will receive, for when I see a Chacham finish learning a Maseches [by heart], I make a celebration for Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> I will receive, for when a Chacham comes in front of me for judgment, I do not sleep until I investigate all angles to vindicate him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> I am disqualified from judging a Chacham - I love him like myself, and a person does not see fault in himself!</p>
