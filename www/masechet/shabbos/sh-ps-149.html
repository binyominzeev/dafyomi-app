<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why is it forbidden [to read from a list]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Bivi):</span> This is a decree lest he [decide not to invite someone and] erase [a name].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> This is a decree lest people read secular (business) documents.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these answers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The list is written high on a wall - there is no concern for erasing, but the concern for reading secular documents applies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> Also Rav Bivi should be concerned for reading secular documents [in general, including this case]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> [Surely,] we are concerned lest one erase even if it is high [just like we are concerned lest one adjust a lamp]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not read by light of a lamp.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> This is forbidden even if it is twice the height of an [average] person above the floor (he is unlikely to tilt it to make it burn better), or two plowshare lengths above the floor, even the height of 10 houses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the list is written low on a wall - there is concern for erasing, but not for reading [secular documents], for people do not confuse a wall with a document.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also Abaye should be concerned lest he erase [in general, including this case]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, the list is etched into a tablet or ledger - there is no concern for erasing (it is difficult to erase, one would remember it is Shabbos before erasing), there is concern for reading.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also Rav Bivi should be concerned for reading!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps people do not confuse a tablet or ledger with a document!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> One may count which guests he will seat inside and which outside, and which courses have not yet been served, reading from [writing on] a wall, but not from a tablet or ledger.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it is written in ink, what is the difference between them?! (Both should be forbidden, lest he erase!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are etched.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Summation of objection:</span> One may read from a wall but not from a tablet or ledger (this shows that even on a tablet we are concerned for reading secular documents)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Defense of Answer #1:</span> Really, it is high on a wall - Tana'im argue about Rabah's concern (lest one adjust a high lamp):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may count his guests and courses by heart, but he may not read them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Acha permits to read from a list on the wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it is low, we should be concerned lest he erase!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is written very high.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>The first Tana holds like Rabah, R. Acha argues.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>The Tana'im argue like the following:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not look in a mirror on Shabbos (lest he cut uneven hairs);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir permits to look in a mirror fixed on the wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, R. Meir permits a fixed mirror because [by the time he gets a scissors] he will remember that it is Shabbos - the same applies if it is not fixed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about a metal mirror:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> One may not look in a metal mirror lest one [use its edge to] cut dangling hairs (he need not delay to get a scissors. Tosfos (Avodah Zarah 29A ha'Mistaper) - this refers to women, men may never look in a mirror on account of "Lo Yilbash Gever Simlas Ishah", adorning oneself like a woman. Rama (Y.D. 156:2) - nowadays, men look in mirrors, this is not considered Simlas Ishah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not read a caption under a picture or portrait on Shabbos (Rashi - lest he come to read secular documents (reading captions is more stringent than reading regular writing on a wall); R. Chananel - it is no better than secular documents);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Even during the week it is forbidden to look at a portrait (Tosfos - that was made for idolatry) - "Al Tifnu El ha'Elilim"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we learn this from the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanin):</span> Do not turn to what you make from the depths of your heart (Rashi - Elilim is like Chalalim; Aruch - do not clear Hash-m from your thoughts).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CASTING LOTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may make a lottery with his sons...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It is permitted with his sons and household, but not with others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel taught that if a group of people lend to each other and are insistent to get back no less than they gave, they transgress [on Shabbos and Yom Tov] measuring, weighing and counting, lending and repaying on Yom Tov, and according to Hillel, also usury.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">149b----------------------------------------149b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should be forbidden even with one's household!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav taught that one may lend to his household and take usury, to give them a taste of usury (so they will know how terrible it is. Since he feeds them, it is all his money, it is not really usury; similarly, since there is no concern of overcharging (they measure merely to avoid jealousy), they do not transgress measuring, weighing...]</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should be permitted to intend to make some portions bigger than others!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, it is - the Mishnah is abbreviated, it means as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may make a lottery with his sons and household at the table, even if some portions are bigger than others;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this permitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is permitted like Rav taught.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>It is permitted with his sons and household, but not with others.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it forbidden with others?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>It is forbidden like Shmuel taught.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>With others, one may not make some portions bigger than others, even during the week.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like gambling, (It is Asmachta - even though everyone agrees that the winner will profit, if the losers would know the outcome beforehand they would not agree; they lack sufficient intent to transfer ownership, hence the winner steals.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may make a lottery [regarding Kodshim, but not regarding the portions].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'But not regarding the portions'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yakov brah d'Bas Yakov):</span> One may not make a lottery on Yom Tov to divide portions from a weekday Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought, since Kohanim are quarrelsome - "V'Amcha ki'Mrivei Chohen" - it should be permitted even to divide weekday portions [to avoid strife] - the Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE EVIL OF NEBUCHADNETZAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yakov brah d'Bas Yakov):</span> If someone is punished on account of Ploni (Iyun Yakov - and Ploni desires this), Ploni does not enter Hash-m's Mechitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from "Va'Yomer Hash-m Mi Yefateh Es Ach'av...; Va'Yetzei ha'Ru'ach...Ani Afatenu...; V'Hayisi Ru'ach Sheker... Va'Yomer...Tzei";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was this Ru'ach?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It was the Ru'ach of Navos (whom Ach'av framed and killed).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Hash-m say "Tzei"?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Hash-m told him 'Leave My Presence' (because Ach'av will be punished through him).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps He told him to leave because he offered to lie - "Dover Shekarim Lo Yikon l'Neged Einai".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from "Sovata Kalon..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Sovata Kalon mi'Kavod" alludes to Nebuchadnetzar (he intended to sodomize Tzidkiyahu, Hash-m made his Orlah grow tremendously, an awesome disgrace);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Shese Gam Atah veha'Arel" refers to Tzidkiyahu (he was punished because Nebuchadnetzar was being punished on account of him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> The entire verse refers to Nebuchadnetzar!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> Tzidkiyahu was a Tzadik - he did not do anything wrong (surely, he is not accountable)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> When that Rasha intended to do so to that Tzadik...(he calls Tzidkiyahu a Tzadik).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We learn from "Gam Anosh la'Tzadik Lo Tov" - Lo Tov is Ra;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "Ki Lo Kel Chofetz Rasha Atah Lo Yegurcha Ra" - Hash-m is a Tzadik, Ra will not dwell in His dwelling.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah discusses casting 'Chalashim' on Kodshim - what is the source that this means 'lotteries'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Eich Nofalta mi'Shomayim...Cholesh Al Goyim";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> He (Nebuchadnetzar) used to cast lots on the great kings, to decide who to sodomize each day;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> [When Nebuchadnetzar died "Nachah Shoktah Kol ha'Aretz...] Kol Malchei Goyim" - the kings had respite from forced homosexual relations.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> As long as Nebuchadnetzar was alive, no one laughed - "Nachah Shoktah Kol ha'Aretz Potzchu Rinah" - this implies that during his life, no one rejoiced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> It is forbidden to stand in Nebuchadnetzar's house - "U'S'irim Yerakdu Sham" (Rashi - only Mazikim should be there - when people enter, they leave; Maharsha - it is forbidden to enter on account of danger).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> When that Rasha intended to do so to that Tzadik, his foreskin stretched 300 Amos, the size of the entire assemblage - "Sovata Kalon mi'Kavod Shese Gam Atah veha'<i>Arel</i>" - the Gematri'a of Arel is 300.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> When that Rasha descended to Gehinom, everyone there clamored, unsure if he came to rule over them (it is better to punished directly by Hash-m than through people) or to be punished with them - "Gam Atah Chulesa Chamonu Eleinu <i>Nimshalta</i>" (this is like Memshalah, kingship);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>A Bas Kol announced "Mi'Mi <i>No'omta</i> Redah v'Hashkevah Es Arelim" (it will not be more Na'im (pleasant) for you than for them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "Eich Shovas Nogesh Shovsah <i>Madhevah</i>" - this nation (Bavel) that said Medod v'Havei (measure out and give [gold] - how did it cease)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Alternatively, it said Me'od Me'od Havi (bring very much) without measure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "U'Rvu Yatirah Husfas Li" - this teaches that [after being an animal for seven years, he returned to his kingship and] he rode on a lion and tied a snake to its (Maharsha - his) head, to fulfill "V'Gam Es Chayas ha'Sadeh Nosati Lo Le'ovdo".</p>
