<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DOES THE ISUR DEPEND ON MEAT OR MARROW?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> No, it obligates when it has a k'Zayis in the place of breakage, whether the k'Zayis is external (meat) or internal (marrow).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> "V'Etzem Lo Sishberu Vo" - this applies to bones with or without marrow (the Ase to eat does not override this Lav).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we fulfill "V'Ochlu ha'Basar ba'Laylah ha'Zeh?" (Surely, the Torah would not command to extract the meat using coals, for this is likely to lead to a transgression!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We eat only meat on the bones [but not marrow].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is also a Mitzvah to eat the marrow!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, how do we fulfill "V'Etzem Lo Sishberu Vo?"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It applies to bones without marrow, but one may break bones with marrow to eat the marrow!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This is not surprising - an Ase (eating the meat) overrides a Lav!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "V'Etzem Lo Sishberu Vo" regarding Pesach Sheni - this is extra, for it already says "K'Chol Chukas ha'Pesach Ya'asu Oso;"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The repetition teaches that the Isur applies to bones with and without marrow.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Reish Lakish - Mishnah (Amud B)):</span> If part of a limb left [Yerushalayim], we cut [through the meat to divide between what left and what stayed inside] to the bone and peel off the meat [inside] until reaching a joint; at the joint we cut.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one may break a limb in a place without a k'Zayis, there is no need to peel so far - we can peel a bit of meat off and cut the bone there!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> This is forbidden lest striking the bone where the meat was peeled will make the bone break [elsewhere, where there is a k'Zayis of meat].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> The Beraisa discusses a bone with a k'Zayis of marrow inside.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TUM'AH OF PASUL KODSHIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Pigul and Nosar are Metamei the hands.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna or Rav Chisda):</span> This is [a decree] on account of Kohanim who are suspected [to intentionally Mefagel Korbanos of people they dislike];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Huna and Rav Chisda):</span> This is on account of lazy Kohanim (Rashbam - and Yisraelim, who are not zealous to finish in time).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first opinion explains the decree about Pigul; the latter opinion explains the decree about Nosar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna or Rav Chisda):</span> A k'Zayis is Metamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Huna and Rav Chisda):</span> A k'Beitzah is Metamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first opinion says that Chachamim fixed the Shi'ur for Tum'ah to be like the Shi'ur for [liability for the] Isur; the second opinion adopts the Shi'ur for [mid'Oraisa] Tum'ah of food.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did Chachamim decree that Yotzei is Tamei?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps they decreed about Nosar, for people are prone to be lazy about eating Kodshim - but they did not need to decree about Yotzei, for people would not explicitly take Kodshim outside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps we are concerned also for this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> If part of a limb left, we cut to the bone and peel off the meat [inside] until reaching a joint; at the joint we cut.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Yotzei is Tamei, this does not help - the Yotzei was Metamei the Nish'ar (the meat that remained inside)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This is Tum'as Beis ha'Starim (they touched internally), it is not Metamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ravina holds that a food is considered to be cut (it is as if the Yotzei and the Nish'ar are separate), so this is not Tum'as Beis ha'Starim - how can he answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The case is, there is less than a k'Zayis or k'Beitzah (the Shi'ur Tum'ah of Yotzei).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one takes meat of Pesach from one Chaburah to another, even though he transgresses a Lav, it is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is Tahor but forbidden - Yotzei from Chaburah to Chaburah is like Yotzei from its permitted place (Yerushalayim) - even though it is forbidden, Chachamim did not decree Tum'ah on it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, it is Tahor and permitted - Yotzei from Chaburah to Chaburah is unlike Yotzei from its permitted place.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Seifa):</span> One who eats it transgresses a Lav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> According to the opinion that the Shi'ur of Yotzei to be Tamei is k'Beitzah, we can say that there is a k'Zayis but not k'Beitzah - therefore one transgresses, but it is not Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that the Shi'ur is k'Zayis, how can we answer? (From the Seifa we know that there is a k'Zayis!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> All agree that Yotzei of Pesach is not Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Benei Chaburah are zealous; they warn each other to be careful.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>The question is about other Kodshim; it is not resolved.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TAKING PESACH FROM ONE CHABURAH TO ANOTHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to forbid taking Pesach from one Chaburah to another?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Lo Sotzi Min ha'Bayis Min ha'Basar Chutzah."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This forbids taking from one house to another - what is the source to forbid from one Chaburah to another [in the same house]?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Chutzah" - you may not take it out from where it may be eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> One who takes Pesach from one Chaburah to another is not liable until Hanachah (setting it at rest), for it says "Sotzi" - it is like Hotza'ah (transferring from Reshus to Reshus) of Shabbos:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One is not liable for Hotza'ah on Shabbos unless he does Akirah (uproots it from a resting position) and Hanachah - the same applies to Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba bar Mamal - Mishnah):</span> [Regarding Chata'os that must be burned outside Yerushalayim, it says "V'Hotzi Es ha'Par" (Vayikra 4:21).] If the animal was being carried out on poles, when the people in front have left the Azarah but not the people in back, those in front are Metamei Begadim, those in back are not [Tamei until they themselves leave].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There was not Hanachah yet!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba bar Mamal):</span> The case is, it is being dragged on the ground (this is considered Hanachah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>KEDUSHAH OF GATES AND DOORWAYS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If part of a limb left [Yerushalayim], we cut to the bone and peel off the meat [inside] until reaching a joint; at the joint we cut.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding other Kodshim, we cut the bone itself with a chopping knife, for there is no Isur to break bones.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Inside from the Agaf (where the door rests when it is closed) is considered inside; outside the Agaf is considered outside; windows in the wall and the thickness [of the top] of the the wall itself are like inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> The same applies to prayer (Rashi - to join to form a Minyan; Tosfos - to answer to things that may be said only with a Minyan).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>He argues with R. Yehoshua ben Levi:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Even an iron wall cannot separate between Yisrael and Hash-m (it does not matter if one is outside and the Minyan is inside).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> The Reisha says that inside from the Agaf is considered inside - this implies that the Agaf itself is considered outside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Seifa says that outside the Agaf is considered outside - this implies that the Agaf itself is considered inside!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> The Agaf of a gate of the Azarah [except for Sha'ar Niknor, between Ezras Nashim and the Azarah] is like inside, since the gate itself was Hukdash [to be like the Azarah; this pertains to limbs of Kodshei Kodoshim, which may not leave the Azarah];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Agaf of a gate of Yerushalayim is like outside, since the gate itself was not Hukdash [to be like Yerushalayim].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> The gates of Yerushalayim were not Hukdash, to allow Metzora'im [who may not enter the city] to take shelter underneath from sun and rain;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> Sha'ar Niknor (the gate between Ezras Nashim and the Azarah) was not Hukdash, to allow a Metzora [in the final stage of Taharah, who may not yet enter the Azarah] to stand inside and stick in his ear, thumb and toe so the blood of his Asham can be put on them. (Tosfos Yevamos (7B) - here also, the intent was to shelter him from sun and rain; alternatively, he could not stand outside the gate and stick his ear inside for the blood, for even if the gate was Hukdash, it would not be "Lifnei Hash-m".)</p></div>
