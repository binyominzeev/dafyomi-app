<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHAT MUST REMAIN TO ALLOW ZERIKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 2:h):</span> Rav holds like R. Yehoshua:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehoshua):</span> Regarding [almost] all Zevachim, whether the Chelev became Tamei and the meat is intact, or the meat became Tamei and the Chelev is intact, we Zorek.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Regarding Pesach [and Shalmei (the ram of a) Nazir - Tosfos deletes this from the text], if the Chelev became Tamei and the meat is intact, we Zorek;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If the meat became Tamei and the Chelev is intact, we do not Zorek; if Zerikah was done, it was Meratzeh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If the owner(s) became Tamei, we do not Zorek; if Zerikah was done, it was not Meratzeh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Other Zevachim are different...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Our Mishnah is R. Yehoshua:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehoshua):</span> If a k'Zayis of the meat or Chelev remains, we Zorek;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If half a k'Zayis of the meat and half a k'Zayis of Chelev remain, we do not Zorek;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>However, regarding an Olah we Zorek - since both the meat and Chelev are offered, they join.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Even if a Minchah is fully intact, we do not Zorek.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Zerikah does not apply to a Minchah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> This refers to Minchas Nesachim (that accompanies a Korban) - one might have thought that it is just like the Korban [and we may Zorek on account of the Minchah as if meat remained] - the Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Zerikah may be done on account of Chelev?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan citing R. Yishmael):</span> ["V'Zorak ha'Kohen Es ha'Dam...v'Hiktir ha'Chelev l'Re'ach Nicho'ach" - it suffices that there is Chelev to be offered, even if there is no meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about Chelev - what is the source to permit Zerikah on account of Yoseres ha'Kaved (diaphragm) or the kidneys [which are offered with the Chelev]?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The questioner assumes that we Zorek on account of them - what is his source?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We said that we may not Zorek on account of Minchas Nesachim - this implies that one may Zorek on account of any part of the Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan himself):</span> "L'Re'ach Nicho'ach" - anything [from the animal] offered on the Mizbe'ach [is a remnant to permit Zerikah].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>The Torah had to write Chelev and l'Re'ach Nicho'ach:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it written only Chelev, we would have said that we may Zorek on account of Chelev, but not on account of Yoseres ha'Kaved or the kidneys - therefore it also says l'Re'ach Nicho'ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it written only l'Re'ach Nicho'ach, we would have said that we may Zorek on account of anything offered on the Mizbe'ach, even a Minchah - therefore it also says Chelev.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN IS PESACH BROUGHT B'TUM'AH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Tzibur or its majority became Tamei, or if the Kohanim were Temei'im and the Tzibur was Tahor, Pesach is brought b'Tumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If the minority of the Tzibur became Tamei, the Tehorim bring Pesach Rishon, and the Temei'im bring Pesach Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> If Yisrael, the Kohanim or the Klei Shares were Temei'im, Pesach is brought b'Tum'ah, because we do not divide a Korban Tzibur (it is disgraceful if Chaburos offering b'Taharah are insistent not to touch others offering it b'Tum'ah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Pesach is brought b'Tum'ah on account of Klei Shares only if the knives became Tamei Mes:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Ba'Chalal Cherev" - a sword [or any metal Keli that touched a Mes] becomes like a Mes, and is Metamei one who touches it - if an individual slaughtered Pesach with such a knife he would become Tamei, and hence Chayav Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But if the knives became Tamei through a Sheretz, they Metamei only the meat but not people, so only Tehorim bring Pesach [Rishon];</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It is better that Tehorim eat Tamei meat, for [normally] this is forbidden only by a Lav, than for Temei'im to eat, for this is punishable by Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This shows that Rav Chisda holds that Tum'ah is Nidcheh b'Tzibur (he allows the bare minimum).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Tum'ah is Nidcheh b'Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Even Tamei people may bring Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Veha'Basar Asher Yiga b'Chol Tamei Lo Ye'achel...Kol Tahor Yochel Basar" - the Seifa [which implicitly forbids Temei'im to eat Kodshim] applies only when the Reisha applies [but not when Tamei meat may be eaten].</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN HALF OF YISRAEL ARE TEHORIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If exactly half of Yisrael were Tehorim, half is like a majority, therefore all bring Pesach Rishon - Tehorim by themselves (in Taharah, since they are like a majority) and Temei'im by themselves (they are like a majority, which is not detained to Pesach Sheni);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> Half is not like the majority;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Therefore, Tehorim bring Pesach Rishon (even a minority of Tehorim brings it), and Temei'im bring Pesach Sheni [like a minority that is detained];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Therefore, Tehorim bring Pesach Rishon, and Temei'im do not bring either Pesach;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">79b----------------------------------------79b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>They do not bring Pesach Rishon because they are not a majority; they do not bring Pesach Sheni because they are not a minority. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Mishnah):</span> If the Tzibur or its majority became Tamei, or if the Kohanim were Temei'im and the Tzibur was Tahor, Pesach is brought b'Tumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A majority [of Temei'im] may bring Pesach b'Tum'ah - half may not!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No - when a majority is Tamei, everyone brings Pesach b'Tum'ah; when half are Tamei, Tehorim bring by themselves and Temei'im by themselves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Seifa):</span> If the minority of the Tzibur became Tamei, the Tehorim bring Pesach Rishon, and the Temei'im bring Pesach Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A minority [of Temei'im] are detained to Pesach Sheni - but if it is half-half, all bring Pesach Rishon - Tehorim by themselves and Temei'im by themselves!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is difficult for Rav Kahana!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, we infer differently - if the minority became Tamei, the Tehorim bring Pesach Rishon, and the Temei'im bring Pesach Sheni;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But if it is half-half, Tehorim bring Pesach Rishon, and Temei'im do not bring either Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This answers for Version #2 - but how can we answer for Version #1, which says that Temei'im bring Pesach Sheni?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, even if it is half-half the Tehorim bring Pesach Rishon, and the Temei'im bring Pesach Sheni - the Tana discusses when the minority is Tamei for parallel structure with the Reisha, when the majority is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Rav - Beraisa #1):</span> If Yisrael was half Tehorim and half Temei'im, Tehorim bring by themselves and Temei'im by themselves.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tana holds that it is Reshus (optional) for women to bring Pesach Rishon - we follow the majority of [people who are obligated, i.e.] men.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 1 (for Rav):</span> Half the males of Yisrael were Tehorim and half were Temei'im, and most women were Temei'os;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He says that Tana'im argue about this - this Tana holds that half is like a majority, and the Tana'im of Beraisos 2 and 3 hold that half is not like a majority.</p></div>
