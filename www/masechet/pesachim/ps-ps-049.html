<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DO WE WAIT UNTIL SHABBOS TO DO BI'UR?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> When the 14th falls on Shabbos (we cannot do Bi'ur at the proper time, the sixth hour on Erev Pesach), so we do Bi'ur before Shabbos;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chachamim say, Bi'ur is done in its proper time. (Mishnah Berurah 444:15-21 - some permitted methods on Shabbos are scattering crumbs where they will be trampled on or swept, giving or selling it to Nochrim, Bitul and covering with a Keli [until after Yom Tov, when he will burn it], and casting it into a latrine.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Eliezer bar Tzadok says, we Meva'er Terumah before Shabbos [only Kohanim can eat it - we are unlikely to find new people to eat it] and Chulin in its time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Eliezer bar Tzadok):</span> Once, my father was in Yavneh and the 14th was on Shabbos; Zunin, the appointee of R. Gamliel told us that it was time to do Bi'ur; I followed my father and we did Bi'ur.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN MUST ONE RETURN TO DO BI'UR?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was on his way to a Mitzvah, i.e. to slaughter Korban Pesach, circumcise his son, or eat Seudas Kidushin (a meal celebrating engagement) in his father-in-law's house, and he remembered that he has Chametz in his house:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he has time to return to his house, do Bi'ur, and return to the Mitzvah, he must do so;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If not, he does Bitul in his heart [and does the Mitzvah].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If Yisraelim are in danger on account of Nochrim, a raging river, a fire or a house that collapsed, and one is heading to save them, he does Bitul in his heart.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If one is going to make Shevisah (Rashi - Eruv Techumim, Tosfos - to lodge elsewhere on Yom Tov) of Reshus (not for the sake of a Mitzvah), he returns immediately.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Similarly, if one left Yerushalayim and remembered that he is carrying Kodesh meat (it became Pasul upon leaving):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he already passed Tzofim (i.e. he is too far away to see the Mikdash), he burns it where he is;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If not, he returns to burn it in front of the Mikdash (alternatively - in Har ha'Bayis), from wood designated for the Ma'arachah (the fire on the Mizbe'ach).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What quantity [of Chametz or meat] obligates one to return?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Meir):</span> The quantity for both of them is k'Beitzah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehudah):</span> The quantity for both of them is k'Zayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Chachamim):</span> The quantity for Kodesh is k'Zayis, the quantity for Chametz is k'Beitzah. (Tosfos - we are more lenient about Chametz, for one can Mevatel it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Contradiction:</span> If one was going to his father-in-law's house for Seudas Kidushin, or was heading to make Shevisah of Reshus, he returns immediately.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> Our Mishnah is R. Yosi; the Beraisa is R. Yehudah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Seudas Kidushin is Reshus;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi says, it is a Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> All agree that the first meal is a Mitzvah - they argue about the second meal [that is eaten with Sivlonos, i.e. nice Kelim that one sends to his betrothed].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>This suggests another resolution.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #2:</span> The Mishnah and Beraisa are both R. Yehudah - the Mishnah discusses the first meal, the Beraisa discusses the second.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> I only heard that Seudas Kidushin is a Mitzvah, but not Seudas Sivlonos;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>R. Yosi says, I heard that Seudos Kidushin and Sivlonos are both Mitzvos.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MARRYING A BAS KOHEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> A Chacham may not benefit from any meal which is not a Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is an example?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> This is a meal celebrating the marriage of a Bas Kohen to a Yisrael (she should have married a Kohen; Maharsha - Chachamim are called Kohanim) or a Chacham's daughter to an ignoramus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Marriage of a Bas Kohen to a Yisrael will not go well.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What will happen?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> She will be widowed, divorced, or will not have children (these are the three outcomes the Torah discusses for such a marriage).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> She will bury him [prematurely], or vice-versa, or she will lead him to poverty.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Yochanan said that one who wants to get rich should cling to the seed of Aharon - all the more so Torah [if he is a Chacham] and Kehunah will make one rich!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is good for a Bas Kohen to marry a Chacham Yisrael, but not an ignoramus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>R. Yehoshua married a Bas Kohen and fell sick - he understood that he was punished because he was unworthy to marry the seed of Aharon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Idi bar Avin married a Bas Kohen and had two sons that were authorized to give Halachic rulings, Rav Sheshes and R. Yehoshua brei d'Rav Idi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> Had I not married a Bas Kohen, I would not have become rich.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Kahana:</span> Had I not married a Bas Kohen, I would not have been exiled (Maharsha - out of humility, he did not consider himself to be a Chacham).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">His Talmidim:</span> But you were exiled to a place of Torah (Eretz Yisrael - this was beneficial)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Kahana:</span> I was not exiled [to a place of Torah] like people normally are (willingly - he fled the kingdom).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Anyone who benefits from a meal of Reshus will ultimately be exiled - it says [about people who indulge in physical pleasures] "V'Ochlim Karim mi'Tzon...; Lachen Atoh Yiglu b'Rosh Golim."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Chacham eats excessively, he will ultimately destroy his house, widow his wife (Rashi - he will abandon her to pursue income, making her like a widow), orphan his children, forget his learning, and have many arguments (because he forgot his learning; alternatively, with creditors);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>His words are not heeded; he desecrates Hash-m's name, his Rebbi's name and his father's name; and he gives a bad repute to himself and his descendants for all generations.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the bad repute?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> They call him [or them] 'the one (Maharsha; Rashi - the son of the one) who [constantly] heats the oven [for his own consumption]'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> They call him 'the one who dances in the pub [so people will give drinks to him]'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> They call him 'the one who licks (finishes all the food in serving) bowls'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Shemayah):</span> They call him 'the one who folds his garment and crouches [to sleep, for he is too drunk to walk home]'.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHOM ONE SHOULD MARRY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One should sell all his property [if necessary] in order to marry a Chacham's daughter - even if he will die or be exiled, his children will [learn from her and] be Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One should not marry the daughter of an Am ha'Aretz (here, this refers to an ignoramus) - if he will die or be exiled [from his house], his children will be Amei ha'Aretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One should sell all his property in order to marry a Bas Chacham and to marry his daughter to a Chacham;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like [planting pits of] grapes of a vine with grapes of a vine - it is a nice match and yields proper progeny;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One should not marry a Bas Am ha'Aretz - this is like grapes of a vine with grapes of a shrub - it is repulsive and does not yield proper progeny (it is like Kil'ayim - Iyun Yakov).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">49b----------------------------------------49b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One should sell all his property in order to marry a Bas Chacham;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he cannot, the order or preference for the girl's father is as follows - a great Tzadik; a head of the congregation; a treasurer of Tzedakah; a Rebbi of children;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>He should not marry a Bas Am ha'Aretz, for an Am ha'Aretz is Sheketz and his wife is Sheretz (Rashi - not careful about Mitzvos; ha'Rif - issue of something Tamei is Tamei); regarding their daughters it says "Arur Shochev Im Kol Behemah" (they lack understanding; like animals).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> An Am ha'Aretz may not eat meat (Maharsha - because it has many prohibitions one must be careful about - slaughter, meat and milk...)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "Zos Toras ha'Behemah veha'Of" - only one who engages in Torah may eat meat of animals and fowl.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> One may Nocher (tear the windpipe and esophagus) an Am ha'Aretz, even on Yom Kipur that is on Shabbos. (Tosfos - he intentionally angers Hash-m - he is prone to kill others; Maharsha - one may shame him, which is likened to murder, even on a day of Shalom amidst Yisrael; Ya'avetz, citing Sefer Chasidim - if he is pursing someone to kill him, anyone may kill him, even if he could be stopped by wounding him.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Talmidim:</span> Why don't you say that one may slaughter him?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One blesses on slaughter [of animals], but not on killing an Am ha'Aretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> One may not accompany an Am ha'Aretz on the road - "Ki Hu Chayecha v'Orech Yomecha" - if he is not concerned for his own life (he does not learn), all the more so he is not concerned for another's life!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> One may tear an Am ha'Aretz like a fish.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Yitzchak):</span> He tears him from the back [to kill him immediately].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> When I was an Am ha'Aretz, I used to say 'if you give me a Chacham, I will bite him like a donkey!'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">His Talmidim:</span> You should have said 'like a dog' (it is more wont to bite)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> A dog bites but does not break bones - a donkey bites and breaks bones.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Marrying one's daughter to an ignoramus is like tying her up in front of a lion:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like a lion tramples and eats [without waiting for his prey to die] without shame, an Am ha'Aretz hits his wife and has relations [without waiting for her to consent] without shame.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If Amei ha'Aretz did not need the business of Chachamim, they would kill us!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Chiya):</span> Learning Torah in front of an Am ha'Aretz is [shameful to him] like having relations with the latter's betrothed in front of him - "Torah Tzivah Lanu Moshe <i>Morashah</i> Kehilas Yakov" - we read this it is as if said Me'orasah (engaged, to all Yisraelim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>Amei ha'Aretz hate Chachamim more than Nochrim hate Yisrael; their wives hate Chachamim even more (Pesach Einayim - because Chachamim's wives do not lend Kelim to them and distance themselves from them at a time when there is Taharah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Chacham who ceased to learn hates Chachamim even more than wives of Amei ha'Aretz (he knows how much Chachamim despise him).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Six laws were taught regarding an Am ha'Aretz:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We do not give testimony in front of him (Me'iri - with two other judges - we need not say that we do not summons him to be a witness, this follows from the next law), and we do not accept testimony from him;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We do not reveal secrets to him, we do not make him an overseer over orphans, or over Tzedakah, and one may not accompany him on the road.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>Some add, if we find something which was surely lost by an Am ha'Aretz (it is clear from the object or location), we do not announce it [to return it].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>The first Tana holds that we return it - perhaps he will have worthy children that will benefit from it - "Yachin v'Tzadik Yilbash."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE SHI'UR FOR WHICH ONE MUST RETURN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Similarly, if one left [Yerushalayim... R. Meir requires one to return for a k'Beitzah of Kodshim or Chametz; R. Yehudah says, for a k'Zayis].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Meir holds that k'Beitzah is an important amount, and R. Yehudah holds that even k'Zayis is important.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Elsewhere, they hold the opposite!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> How much must one eat to be included in a Zimun (a responsive invitation to bless after eating)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He must eat at least a k'Zayis (we assume that the anonymous first Tana is R. Meir);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehudah):</span> He must eat at least a k'Beitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> The opinions must be switched (in the other Mishnah - Tosfos Berachos 49B (R. Meir)).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> We need not switch the opinions:- Zimun is learned from verses, Kodshim and Chametz depend on reasoning:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir expounds "V'Ochalta" refers to eating, which is normally a k'Zayis; "v'Sovata" refers to drinking (mid'Oraisa, one is obligated to bless only if he satisfied his thirst);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah expounds "V'Ochalta v'Sovata" - eating which satiates, i.e. k'Beitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Meir holds that the Shi'ur to obligate returning for Kodshim and Chametz equals the Shi'ur for Tum'ah, i.e. k'Beitzah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Yehudah holds that the Shi'ur for returning equals the Shi'ur for Isur, i.e. k'Zayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Noson):</span> The Shi'ur for both of these is two k'Beitzim.</p></div>
