<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHAT IS CONSIDERED TZELI ESH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not roast Pesach [on a spit or griddle...R. Gamliel once told his slave to roast the Pesach on a griddle].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The episode contradicts the law!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated, it means as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is permitted if the griddle has holes (Rashi - the Pesach is totally in the gap between crossbars of the griddle);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Tzadok says, R. Gamliel once told his slave to roast the Pesach on a griddle with holes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chinena bar Idi):</span> (Tana'im (26B) argue about the permissibility of bread baked using forbidden wood.) If an oven was heated with peels of Orlah and [the coals were] swept out and bread was baked inside, according to the opinion that forbids [when bread baked on the coals themselves, because Yesh Shevach Etzim b'Pas], what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> It is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chinena bar Idi):</span> But Rav Chinena Sava said in the name of R. Yochanan that if an oven was heated and [the coals were] swept out and Pesach was roasted inside, this is not called Tzeli Esh (it is invalid);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "Tzeli Esh" twice [to require roasting directly by a fire].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had it not written "Tzeli Esh" twice, we would call it "Tzeli Esh" (likewise, we should say that the bread was baked by the Orlah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ada):</span> We learn from Pesach [that cooking in an oven heated by a fire is unlike cooking by the fire].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ada):</span> It says "Tzeli Esh" twice there - otherwise, we would have thought to Machshir even if the coals were swept out;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Here, the Torah forbids [benefit from] Orlah - the Orlah is not here.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHAT IS CONSIDERED FIRE?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If one made cuts in the Pesach [to help it roast quickly - he did not separate it into pieces] and roasted it on coals, this is Tzeli Esh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Achdevoy bar Ami):</span> Elsewhere, Rebbi does not consider coals to be fire!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1) Question:</span> "Michvas Esh" refers to a scald through fire (it has special laws regarding Tzara'as) - what is the source to include a scald through a coal, hot ashes, boiling plaster or anything else heated by fire, i.e. even water?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Michvah" twice to include these.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is only because it says "Michvah" twice - otherwise we would not consider coals to be fire! (The Gemara does not explain why this is according to Rebbi. Tzelach - Rebbi does not use the repetition of "Tzeli Esh" to exempt one who eats Pesach Na before night [unlike Chachamim - see Maharsha 41B], therefore he uses it to teach that we do not learn from Michvah that things other than fire are called "Esh.")</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> No verse is needed for a wooden coal (surely, it is considered fire) - the Beraisa discusses a metal coal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A metal coal is considered fire!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a Bas Kohen transgresses adultery, "Ba'Esh Tisaref" - yet Rav Masnah taught that molten lead is used (it is poured into her mouth and burns her innards)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ba'Esh <i>Tisaref</i>" is extra, to include any burning that comes from fire.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> All the more so, fire itself is valid - we should surround her with bundles of twigs and burn her!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Sereifah-Sereifah" from Nadav and Avihu - just like their Neshamos were burned (i.e. they were killed) but their bodies remained intact, death by burning should be similar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should kill through boiling water!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> [The person would die slowly -] Rav Nachman expounded "V'Ohavta l'Re'echa Kamocha" - [Chachamim must] choose a nice death for one who must be executed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why do we need the Gezeirah Shavah to disqualify burning the body?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We know that burning the Neshamah but not the body is called burning only from the Gezeirah Shavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We would fulfill Rav Nachman's teaching by making a big fire to kill her quickly;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The verse teaches, this is not so (we need not burn the body).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "Ba'Esh"? (It would suffice to say "Tisaref"!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This includes naturally molten lead [the ground].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Sometimes "Ba'Esh Tisaref" does not include any burning that does not come from fire!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says about Parim ha'Nisrafim (inner Chata'os that are burned outside the Machaneh) "V'Soraf Oso Al Etzim ba'Esh";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Ba'Esh" - not by boiling plaster or gypsum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> Regarding Misas Beis Din it says "Ba'Esh" and then "Tisaref" to include any burning that does not come from fire;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding Parim ha'Nisrafim it says "V'Soraf Oso Al Etzim ba'Esh" - Esh is at the end, to require actual fire.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also regarding Parim ha'Nisrafim it mentions [in another verse] burning at the end - "Al Shefech ha'Deshen Yisaref"!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">75b----------------------------------------75b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn different laws from that Yisaref:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Yisaref" - even if there are no ashes there; "Yisaref" - even after most of it catches fire [one must engage in burning it].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (b) - Ravina):</span> Beraisa #1 is erroneous, it should say as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "Michvas Esh" applies only to a scald through fire <i>or a coal</i> - what is the source to include a scald through hot ashes, boiling plaster or anything else heated by fire, i.e. even water?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Michvah" twice to include these.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE COALS USED ON YOM KIPUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Here, Rebbi considers coals to be fire;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Gachalei" [regarding the coals the Kohen Gadol takes from the Mizbe'ach on Yom Kipur for the Ketores] refers to Omemos (fading coals)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Esh."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Esh" mandates a flame!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Gachalei."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> He takes glimmering coals (if one would insert a chip of wood, it would catch flame).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> First we suggest that Gachalei refers to fading coals - this implies that glimmering coals are called Esh;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Then it suggests that "Esh" mandates a flame - we reject this, because it says "Gachalei," therefore he takes glimmering coals instead - this shows that glimmering coals are not called Esh!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> First we suggest that Gachalei refers to fading or glimmering coals - we reject this, because it says "Esh" (this excludes fading coals);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Then we say that had it written only "Esh," we would require a flame - we reject this, because it says "Gachalei";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Therefore, he takes glimmering coals [which are called Gechalim <i>and</i> Esh].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> This shows that coals are not called Esh (had it written only "Esh," we would require a flame), unlike Rebbi!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Rather, first we suggest that Gachalei refers to fading or glimmering coals - we reject this, because it says "Esh";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Then it says that had it written only "Esh," we would allow a flame or glimmering coals - since it also says "Gachalei," glimmering coals are required.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> How could one bring a flame without coals?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He anoints a Keli with oil, and catches it on fire.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is improper in front of a mortal king (it exudes smoke) - all the more so we do not do so in front of Hash-m! (The Kodesh ha'Kodoshim gets filled with smoke of the Ketores (Yoma 53A), and Haktaras Olas ha'Of with its feathers makes much smoke! Perhaps here is different, for the flame is merely Hechsher Avodah, but those are actual Avodos in which Hash-m desires smoke - "Ki be'Anan Era'eh Al ha'Kapores" (Vayikra 16:2), and to make the Mizbe'ach appear satiated with an Ani's Korban (Vayikra Rabah 3:5 according to Rashi Vayikra 1:17).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rather, first we suggest that Gachalei refers only to coals that are fading, not glimmering - we reject this, because it says "Esh";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Then it says that had it written only "Esh," we would allow half coals and half flame - by the time he takes them in [to the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim], they will be all coals!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"V'Lokach Malei ha'Machtah Gachalei Esh" mandates that from the time he takes them they are all coals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is 'Omemos' spelled with an Aleph, or with an Ayin?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda bar Avdimi):</span> We learn from "Arazim Lo Amamuhu" (it is spelled with an Ayin).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>REMOVING PARTS OF A KORBAN PESACH THAT BECAME FORBIDDEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Korban touched the ceramic wall of the oven [the outer surface of the meat was cooked by the oven and not by the fire, therefore] one must peel off a layer of meat from the place that touched;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If juice dripped onto the Cheres (ceramic, and is cooked by it) and splattered back onto the Korban, one must remove [more than just a layer of meat] from that place [for the drop gets absorbed);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If juice dripped onto flour, one must remove a handful of flour [and burn it, for the juice is cooked by the flour and absorbed into it].</p></div>
