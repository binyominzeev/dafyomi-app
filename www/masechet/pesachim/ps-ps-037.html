<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THICK MATZAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> One may not bake thick bread on Pesach;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Beis Hillel permit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered thick bread?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> It is a Tefach thick, like Lechem ha'Panim (see note in Appendix).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objections (Rav Yosef):</span> Lechem ha'Panim was made by Zerizim, was worked greatly (the dough was rolled 300 times and beaten 500 times), was baked using dry wood in a [periodically] hot oven of metal, therefore it could be so thick;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We cannot be as lenient regarding people who are not Zerizim, do not work it so much, use wet wood in a Cheres oven that is [usually] cold!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav or Rebbi):</span> 'Thick' bread refers to a large quantity [of loaves];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is called thick because the dough is thick during kneading [before it is separated into loaves].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Alternatively, a large quantity is called 'thick' in the Tana's locale.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it forbidden?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is on account of excess exertion, this applies to every Yom Tov, not only Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, this is true - the Tana mentioned Pesach because he was discussing Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> One may not bake thick bread on Yom Tov;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Hillel permit.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MATZAH WITH DESIGNS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One is Yotzei with bread that is clean, coarse, or has designs, even though it is forbidden to bake Matzah with designs on Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, Chachamim told Baisus ben Zunin that it is forbidden because a woman delays [while making the designs], and it is prone to become Chametz. (It is clear from Tosefta 2.12 that the text must say <i>R.</i> Yehudah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Baisus:</span> It is possible to make a mold [so there will be no delay]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Will we say that all designed Matzah is forbidden except for yours (others do not have molds)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer bar Tzadok:</span> I once saw designed Matzah brought in front of R. Gamliel during Pesach - I asked my father, 'didn't Chachamim forbid this'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - R. Tzadok:</span> It is forbidden only for [professional] bakers, regular people are permitted (they are not so particular about the design, so there is not a large delay).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - R. Tzadok:</span> It is permitted for bakers (they are proficient to make it quickly, and they have molds), it is forbidden for regular people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yosi says, one may make designs in wafers, but not in buns (because they are thick, even a small delay can cause Chimutz).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>FROM WHAT MUST CHALAH BE SEPARATED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are exempt from Chalah - Sufganim (spongy bread), bread fried in honey, wafers made from a thin dough, 'Chalah of a [frying] pan' (this will be explained)', and Meduma (Terumah mixed with [less than 100 times its own volume of] Chulin - it is forbidden to Zarim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is 'Chalah of a pan'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> It is scalded bread of regular people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> These [first four breads in the Mishnah] are made in a pan (Chalah is separated only from what will be baked in an oven).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Chalah is taken even from things made in a pan - the Mishnah exempts things baked in the sun.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If the following were made in a pan, Chalah must be taken - Sufganim, bread fried in honey and wafers made from a thin dough;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they were made in the sun, they are exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Reish Lakish is [seemingly] refuted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ula, on behalf of Reish Lakish):</span> The Beraisa discusses when the pan was heated and then the dough was stuck to it (this is like baking in an oven).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If the dough was stuck to it and then the pan was heated, it would be exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Seifa exempt when they were made in the sun - it should distinguish within the case of a pan, and exempt when the dough was stuck first!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is abbreviated, it means as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is when the pan was heated and then the dough was stuck to it - but if the dough was stuck first, it is as if it was made in the sun, it is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One is Yotzei with Matzah that is Heina (not fully cooked), or with Matzah baked in a pan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here also, the pan was heated and then the dough was stuck to it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered Heina?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> This is when one cuts it and strands do not extend from one side to the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The same applies to Lachmei Todah (slaughter of the Todah is Mekadesh them if they were baked to this extent (Rashi); elsewhere, the Gemara says that Kedushah depends on having formed a crust - these must coincide (Tosfos Menachos). Sefas Emes - the Rambam explains, not having strands is a later degree of baking; it is the final degree of baking required.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious - both of them are called 'Lechem'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding Lachmei Todah it says "V'Hikriv Mimenu Echad mi'Kol Korban" - a full loaf must be taken from each of the four kinds of bread;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">37b----------------------------------------37b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that because Heina loaves can fall apart, they are considered to be broken - Rava teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> Ma'isa (this will be explained) is exempt from Chalah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Hillel obligate it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Shamai say, Chalitah (this will be explained) is obligated;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Beis Hillel exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Ma'isa is flour put on top of boiling water; Chalitah is boiling water put on top of flour.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi exempts both of them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Some say, he obligates both of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>Chachamim say, both of them are exempt if they were made in a pan, and obligated if they were made in an oven.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the first Tana distinguish Ma'isa from Chalitah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah and R. Yochanan or R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Indeed, no one distinguishes them - two Tana'im taught the Reisha! (The first Tana taught that Beis Shamai exempt Ma'isa and Beis Hillel obligate - [he holds that] the same applies to Chalitah; the second Tana taught that Beis Shamai obligate Chalitah and Beis Hillel exempt - he says the same about Ma'isa.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Chachamim exempt both if they were made in a pan, and obligate if they were made in an oven - this refutes R. Yochanan!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about this:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Chalah must be taken from Ma'isa and Chalitah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Lechem."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, only something baked in an oven is called 'Lechem'.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah does not argue with the first Tana!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about something cooked in a pan - the first Tana obligates, and R. Yehudah exempts.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all exempt something [only] cooked in a pan - they argue about if it was later baked in an oven:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Tana holds that since it was later baked in an oven it is considered bread; R. Yehudah holds that only something baked in an oven from the beginning is bread.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> R. Yehudah learns from "V'Ofu Eser Nashim Lachmechem b'Sanur Echad" - something is called bread only if it was baked in one oven [and not cooked elsewhere].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span><p><span class="cl">Rabah (to R. Zeira):</span> Ask Ula about a dough that was stuck to the inside (Rashi - of a pan; Tosfos - of an oven) and [the pan or oven was] heated from the outside!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(v)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> He will tell me that this is something cooked in a pan [which R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish argue about]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef (to R. Zeira):</span> Ask Ula about a dough that was stuck to the inside and was baked <i>facing</i> a flame [above]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> He will tell me that this is how most poor people bake [to save wood - surely R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish argue about this]!</p></div>
