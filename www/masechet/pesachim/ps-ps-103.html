<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE ORDER OF HAVDALAH AND KIDUSH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> When Yom Tov is on Motza'ei Shabbos, one blesses on wine, Kidush, light and Havdalah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The order is wine, light, Havdalah and Kidush;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> The order is wine, Havdalah, light, and Kidush (Rashbam explains many of the reasons for the different opinions);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Levi):</span> The order is Kidush, light, wine and Havdalah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> The order is Kidush, wine, light, and Havdalah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar brei d'Ravina):</span> The order is light, Kidush, wine and Havdalah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Marsa):</span> The order is light, wine, Havdalah and Kidush.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Shmuel's father):</span> What is the order of Havdalah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rebbi citing R. Yehoshua):</span> It is light, Havdalah, wine and Kidush.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> R. Yehoshua's order (Havdalah precedes Kidush) is like a king (Shabbos) leaving and a governor (Yom Tov) arriving - first they escort the king out, then they go out to greet the governor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the conclusion?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The order is wine, Kidush, Zeman, light and Havdalah (this is like Rav - Abaye adds that Zeman is said right after Kidush, for it is the reason Kidush is said);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> He says wine, Kidush, light, Havdalah and Zeman (Zeman is last, for it may be said any time during the festival, even without wine).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>The Halachah follows Rava (we delay Havdalah, so it will not look like we are eager to end Shabbos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>Rav Huna bar Yehudah visited Rava; Rava blessed on spices first.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna):</span> They do not argue about light (all agree that we bless on it first)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> [On a regular Motza'ei Shabbos] we bless on light, Birkas ha'Mazon, spices, and Havdalah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel say, we bless on light, spices, Birkas ha'Mazon, and Havdalah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> That is according to R. Meir - R. Yehudah says, all agree that Birkas ha'Mazon is first and Havdalah is last;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue about light and spices - Beis Shamai bless first on light, Beis Hillel bless first on spices.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> People follow Beis Hillel, according to R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN MUST ONE BLESS AGAIN ON WINE?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rav Yakov bar Aba visited Rava; he saw that he blessed Borei Peri ha'Gafen on the first cup, and again on the cup of Birkas ha'Mazon and drank it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yakov:</span> Why did you bless a second time?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> This is how we did in the Reish Galusa's house.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yakov:</span> We do so in the Reish Galusa's house because we are unsure whether or not we will receive wine - but here, the cup is in front of us, and we plan to have it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> I did like Talmidim of Rav [after they accepted the words of Rav Yeiva]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Beruna and Rav Chananel, Talmidim of Rav, were at a meal; Rav Yeiva the elder was serving them. They told him 'give us [wine] and we will bless [Birkas ha'Mazon]'l they reconsidered and said 'give to us and we will drink.'</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">103b----------------------------------------103b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yeiva:</span> Rav says that once you said that you will bless, you may no longer drink!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You decided not to drink any more.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rav Acha brei d'Rava was serving Ameimar, Mar Zutra and Rav Ashi; Ameimar blessed on every cup of wine, Mar Zutra blessed only on the first and [that of Birkas ha'Mazon, the] last, and Rav Ashi blessed only on the first.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha):</span> Whom should we follow?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Ameimar:</span> I [blessed on each because] I kept deciding not to drink more, and changed my mind;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Mar Zutra:</span> I hold like Rav's Talmidim (even deciding to say Birkas ha'Mazon mandates a new Berachah before drinking more);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> The Halachah does not follow Rav's Talmidim, for when Yom Tov is on Motza'ei Shabbos, Rav says to bless on wine, Kidush, light and Havdalah (Tosfos - just like these Berachos are not considered an interruption between Borei Peri ha'Gafen and drinking the wine, Birkas ha'Mazon is not an interruption)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>This is wrong! Saying Birkas ha'Mazon shows that he decided not to drink any more; saying Kidush and Havdalah does not show this.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>RAVA'S HAVDALAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>[When Rav Yakov was visiting Rava and] the time for Havdalah came, Rava's attendant lit a torch from the lamp.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yakov (to Rava):</span> Why do you need a torch? You could have used the lamp!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> I did not tell him to do so (see note in Appendix).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yakov:</span> Had you not said that it is proper, he would not do so on his own!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> It was taught that the ideal Mitzvah is with a torch - don't you agree?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rava blessed '...Who distinguishes between Kodesh and profane, between light and dark, between Yisrael and the nations, between Shabbos and the six days of action.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yakov:</span> Why must you say so much? Rav Yehudah taught that '...Who distinguishes between Kodesh and profane' is the Havdalah of Rebbi!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> I hold like R. Elazar, who says that one may not say less than three or more than seven [pairs that Hash-m distinguishes].</p></div>
