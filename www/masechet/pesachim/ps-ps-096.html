<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since he is permitted to eat the meat of Pesach b'Tum'ah, the same applies to the Eimurim;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One had to buy Pesach Mitzrayim on the tenth of Nisan; a bundle of hyssop was used to sprinkle the blood on the lintel and the two doorposts; it was eaten hastily in one night; and Pesach Doros is for seven days (this will be explained).</p></div>
