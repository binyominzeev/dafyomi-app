<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MAY WE LEARN FROM ISUREI NAZIR?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The Torah taught that Heter joins to Isur in two places - Isurei Nazir and absorptions of a Korban Chatas;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Whenever there are Shenei Kesuvim ha'Ba'im k'Echad (two verses that teach the same principle, and one of them could have been learned from the other), we do not learn from them to other cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The case of Nazir is as above; absorptions of a Chatas are as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> "Kol Asher Yiga bi'Vsarah Yikdash" (any food that touches a Chatas becomes Kodesh) - perhaps this is even if the food did not absorb!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "<i>Bi</i>'Vsarah" - it is Kodesh only if Chatas is [absorbed] in the meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"Yikdash" - the food it touched become like the Chatas - if the Chatas is Pasul [and may not be eaten], the food may not be eaten; if the Chatas is Kosher, the food may be eaten with the stringencies of Chatas (male Kohanim may eat it in the Azarah until dawn. Stringencies of the other food, e.g. if it was a Shelamim offered yesterday which may be eaten only until nightfall tonight, also apply.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim should agree that these are Shenei Kesuvim [ha'Ba'im k'Echad - why do they learn Ta'am k'Ikar from Nazir to all Isurim]?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They say that these are not Shenei Kesuvim because we could not learn either from the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Akiva holds that one is extra:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Granted, we could not learn Nazir from Chatas - we do not learn [stringencies] from Kodshim to Chulin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But we could learn Chatas from Nazir - we could learn from Nazir to the entire Torah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Chachamim say that both are needed - Chatas is needed to teach that Heter joins to Isur; this does not apply to Chulin, because we cannot learn Chulin from Kodshim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Mishras is needed to teach that Ta'am k'Ikar - we learn to all Isurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Akiva holds that both teach that Heter joins to Isur, therefore they are Shenei Kesuvim, and we may not learn from them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi - Beraisa):</span> "Mi'Kol Asher Ye'aseh mi'Gefen ha'Yayin me'Chartzanim v'Ad Zag" - this teaches that all Isurim [of vine products] of Nazir join with each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva holds that Heter joins to Isur - there is no need to teach that Isur joins to Isur!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> Heter joins to Isur only if they are eaten together, but Isur joins to Isur even if they are eaten one after the other.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN IS DOUGH BATEL IN A TROUGH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If dough is in cracks in a kneading trough:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If there is a k'Zayis in one place, he must destroy it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If not, it is Batel because it is so small. (This Bitul is not standard Bitul Chametz - rather, since it is unimportant, it is considered like part of the trough.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The same applies to Tum'ah - if one is Makpid about it (intends to remove it), it is a Chatzitzah; if he wants it to stay there, it is like part of the trough (this will be explained).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> This (the obligation to destroy a k'Zayis in one place) is only in a place where it does not strengthen [the trough] - but in a place where it strengthens it, one need not destroy it (one will surely leave it there, it is Batel to the trough).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This implies that one need not destroy less than k'Zayis even in a place where it does not strengthen it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - (Mishnah):</span> If not, it is Batel because it is so small.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This is only in a place where it strengthens it - but in a place where it does not strengthen it, one must destroy it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This implies that one must destroy a k'Zayis even in a place where it strengthens it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Version #1 - Beraisa #1):</span> If dough is in cracks in a kneading trough:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In a place where it strengthens it, it is not a Chatzitzah, and one does not transgress [Bal Yera'eh and Bal Yimatzei on account of it];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In a place where it does not strengthen it, it is a Chatzitzah, and one transgresses.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This refers to a k'Zayis - but less than k'Zayis is not a Chatzitzah, and one does not transgress, even in a place where it does not strengthen it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Version #2, and Contradiction - Beraisa #2):</span> If dough is in cracks in a kneading trough:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In a place where it strengthens it, it is not a Chatzitzah, and one does not transgress;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">45b----------------------------------------45b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In a place where it does not strengthen it, it is a Chatzitzah, and one transgresses.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This refers to less than a k'Zayis - but a k'Zayis is a Chatzitzah, and one transgresses, even in a place where it strengthens it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #1 (Rav Huna):</span> The lenient [Beraisa, i.e. #1, is erroneous; it] must be deleted on account of the stringent (Beraisa #2 is correct).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> [Both are correct -] Tana'im argue about this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One must destroy moldy bread, because one can grind it up and use it to ferment other dough (therefore, it is forbidden like Se'or);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, this is if it is being kept [for fermenting, which is] for the sake of eating - but Kofes Se'or (a block of heavily leavened dough) which was designated for sitting is Batel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Only R. Shimon says that it is Batel - the first Tana holds that even 'Bitul' (designation for sitting) does not help for a k'Zayis [it is still considered Chametz]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> You explain the argument about a k'Zayis - how do you explain the argument about less than k'Zayis? (Even R. Shimon would not say that it is Batel in a place where it does not strengthen it, for it is standing to be eaten!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #3 (Abaye):</span> Beraisa #1 and Beraisa #2 are both like R. Shimon [they do not argue, just they use the same words to refer to different places]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beraisa #1 discusses only where kneading is done (the bottom and walls, but not the rim) - it calls the bottom a place where it strengthens (even a k'Zayis is Batel, for it is urgently needed to hold water which gathers there), and it calls the walls a place where it does not strengthen (less than a k'Zayis is Batel, but a full k'Zayis is not Batel, for the walls need not be so watertight);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beraisa #2 discusses even where kneading is not done (the rim) - it calls the walls a place where it strengthens (less than a k'Zayis is Batel), and it calls the rim a place where it does not strengthen (no amount is Batel).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Do not think that 'Where kneading is not done' only refers to the back [outside] of the rim [but on top of the rim is considered a place of kneading] - rather, 'Where kneading is not done' refers [even] to on top of the rim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious (people do not knead on top)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that since sometimes the dough swells and covers the rim, it is considered a place of kneading - Rav Ashi teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Nachman citing Rav):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rav Yitzchak bar Ashi said in the name of Rav that if one plastered Kofes Se'or [to sit on it], it is Batel!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Amora'im argue about the opinion of Rav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Nachman citing Rav):</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Shimon, for Rav Yitzchak bar Ashi said in the name of Rav that if one smeared the outside of the dough with mud, it is Batel. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DO HALF K'ZEISIM JOIN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If two half k'Zeisim [of Chametz] are joined by a strip of dough:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If when one picks up the strip the Chametz comes with it, one must destroy them; if not, not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> This applies only to a kneading trough - but in the house, [in either case] he must destroy them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He might [sweep the house and] bring them together.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions (Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> Do the half k'Zeisim join if one is in the house and the other is in one of the following places:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The upper story; an Achsadra (a room open on one side); another house interior to the first?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>These questions are not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SPOILED CHAMETZ</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If bread became moldy and is not fit for people to eat but dogs can eat it, it has Tum'as Ochlim if it is k'Beitzah (the size of an egg), and [even if it is Terumah] it may be burned with Tamei [Chametz] on [Erev] Pesach;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Noson says, it does not have Tum'as Ochlim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the following Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The general rule is - anything [that was initially] fit for people to eat is Mekabel Tum'ah as long as dogs can eat it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is unlike R. Noson.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If flour was put in a tanning bowl:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was put within three days of Pesach, one must destroy it; if it was more than three days before Pesach, he need not destroy it (the smell of the Keli spoils it - excrement is used in tanning).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Noson says, this is if it was not put with hides - but if it was put with hides, in either case he need not destroy it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah follows R. Noson, even if it was put the same day [Erev Pesach], even a short time [before Bi'ur].</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>WHEN IS CHAMETZ A CHATZITZAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The same applies to Tum'ah - if one is Makpid about it, it is a Chatzitzah; if he wants it to stay there, it is like part of the trough.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is not 'the same' - Bi'ur depends on a Shi'ur, Tum'ah depends on Kepeidah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> Indeed, it means 'But Tum'ah is different...'</p></div>
