<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHICH PARTS OF PESACH MAY BE EATEN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may eat [to fulfill the Mitzvah of eating Pesach - Rashi; Rambam - it is not forbidden on account of breaking bones] in a tender kid anything that can be eaten in a mature ox (it does not get too hard), and the shoulder blade and cartilage.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference (Rabah):</span> Our Mishnah permits in a kid whatever can be eaten in an ox - but what cannot be eaten in an ox is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Seifa):</span> ...And the shoulder blade and cartilage.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>These cannot be eaten in an ox!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #1 (Rabah):</span> Different Tana'im taught the Reisha and Seifa - the Reisha permits anything that can be eaten in an ox;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Some permit even the shoulder blade and cartilage.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #2 (Rava):</span> The Seifa explains the Reisha - anything that can be eaten in an ox after much cooking may be eaten in a roasted kid, i.e. the shoulder blade and cartilage.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Rava - Beraisa):</span> Anything that can be eaten in an ox after much cooking may be eaten in a roasted kid, i.e. the shoulder blade and cartilage; soft sinews are considered like meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One may be Manuy on sinews that ultimately harden [in a mature animal - they are considered like meat].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> One may not be Manuy on them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>R. Yochanan considers their current state - now they are not hard;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Reish Lakish considers their final state - they will harden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish - Beraisa):</span> Anything that can be eaten in an ox may be eaten in a kid, i.e. the shoulder blade and cartilage. (Presumably, this is the above Beraisa - even though it does not mention cooking and roasting, it must mean 'what can be eaten in an ox after much cooking...', for above we said that cartilage cannot be eaten in an ox, and we did not ask from this Beraisa. Alternatively, perhaps it is the Mishnah, and 'i.e.' is an added explanation.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It permits the shoulder blade and cartilage, but not sinews that ultimately harden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It permits the shoulder blade and cartilage - the same applies to sinews that ultimately harden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The shoulder blade and cartilage may be eaten [in a roasted kid] because they can be eaten in an ox after much cooking - the same applies to sinews that ultimately harden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Did R. Yochanan really say that one may be Manuy on sinews that ultimately harden, because we consider their current state?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But Reish Lakish asked him if the skin of the head of a tender calf is Metamei [like food], and he answered that it is not;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This shows that he considers it as if it already hardened!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> This is a poor question - R. Yochanan retracted and said that the Mishnah [from which he learned that we consider the current state] is like an individual [but the Halachah follows Chachamim, who forbid something that, will harden].</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN IS IT FORBIDDEN TO BREAK BONES?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who breaks a bone of a Tahor Pesach receives 40 lashes;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One who leaves over meat of [even a] Tahor Pesach or breaks a bone of a Tamei Pesach does not receives 40 lashes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> We understand why one who leaves over meat is not lashed:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Lo Sosiru...veha'Nosar...[ba'Esh Tisrofu]" - the verse gives an Ase to fix the Lav, therefore one is not lashed for it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yakov):</span> No, one is not lashed because this Lav is transgressed without an action, one is not lashed for such Lavim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>But why is one who breaks a bone of a Tamei Pesach exempt?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Etzem Lo Sishberu <i>Vo</i>" - in a Kosher Pesach, not in a Pasul Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Etzem Lo Sishberu Vo" - in a Kosher Pesach, not in a Pasul Pesach;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rebbi says, "B'Vayis Echad Ye'achel...v'Etzem Lo Sishberu Vo" - the Isur to break bones applies only to a Pesach that may be eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these opinions?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmeyah):</span> They argue about [breaking bones in] Pesach ha'Ba b'Tumah - the first Tana permits, for [even though it may be eaten] it is not considered Kosher (Tum'ah is Nidcheh b'Tzibur), and Rebbi forbids for it may be eaten.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">84b----------------------------------------84b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> No, all permit regarding Pesach ha'Ba b'Tumah - [Rebbi comes to be lenient - Bach deletes this from the text], it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> Rather, they argue about a Pesach that was once permitted and became Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Tana forbids if it is Kosher - this was offered in a Kosher way;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rebbi forbids only if one may eat it - this may not be eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> No, all permit in such a case.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Now it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Abaye):</span> Rather, they argue about breaking bones before night - the first Tana forbids, for it is Kosher; Rebbi permits, for it may not be eaten yet.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> One can be Manuy on the brain, but not on marrow in bones.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can one be Manuy on the brain?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is because one can scrape it out [through the nose].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If Rebbi permits breaking bones during the day, he should allow Minuy on marrow, for one may break the bones during the day!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question (Abaye):</span> How do you explain why one may not be Manuy on marrow? Even after dark, one may put a hot coal on a bone to burn through, enabling us to remove the marrow!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The prohibition of breaking bones does not apply to sinews, nor to burning a bone.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> You must say we decree to forbid this;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>I say it is lest the coal cause the bone to break [elsewhere]; Rava forbids lest one burn some of the marrow.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Likewise, Rebbi does not allow Minuy on marrow, lest one break bones after dark!</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Tana forbids [breaking any part of it], for it (the part inside) is Kosher; Rebbi permits [breaking where it left], for [there] it may not be eaten:</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Tana forbids, for it is Kosher; Rebbi permits, for it may not be eaten - it is offered to Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> All agree that the Lav of breaking bones does not apply to the tail, for it may not be eaten at all!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #7 (Rav Ashi):</span> They argue about a limb with less than k'Zayis of meat:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Tana forbids, for it is Kosher; Rebbi permits, for he requires something that may be eaten, i.e. it has a Shi'ur that is considered eating.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Ravina):</span> All permit in this case, for it lacks a Shi'ur fit for eating;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #8 (Ravina):</span> They argue about a limb with a k'Zayis of meat that was broken in a place without a k'Zayis:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Tana forbids, for it is Kosher; Rebbi permits, for he requires something with a Shi'ur that is considered eating in the place of breakage.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for answers 2,3,6 and 7- Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "B'Vayis Echad Ye'achel...v'Etzem Lo Sishberu Vo" - the Isur to break bones only applies to a Kosher Pesach, not to a Pasul one;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it once was permitted and became Pasul at the time of eating, the Isur does not apply;</p></div>
