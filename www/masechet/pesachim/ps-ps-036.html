<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MATZAH WITH WHICH ONE IS NOT YOTZEI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Tevel should be forbidden also on account of Chametz!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> The Beraisa is R. Shimon, who says that Ein Isur Chal Al Isur (a second prohibition does not take effect on something that is already forbidden):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> If one ate a Neveilah on Yom Kippur [b'Shogeg] he is exempt [from a Chatas, since the Isur of eating on Yom Kipur was not Chal on it. Even if it died on Yom Kipur, it was Asur on account of Ever Min ha'Chai or Eino Zavu'ach beforehand, therefore the Isur of Yom Kipur is not Chal on it.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> It is even like Chachamim - one is Yotzei with Matzah that [had it become Chametz] would be forbidden only on account of Chametz, but not with something which is forbidden also on account of Tevel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Beraisa does not say that it is forbidden <i>only</i> on account of Chametz!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must answer like Rav Sheshes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Gelili) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one is Yotzei with Ma'aser Sheni in Yerushalayim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Lechem Oni" - it must be permitted to an Onen (one who lost a relative today) - Ma'aser Sheni is forbidden to an Onen ("Lo Achalti v'Oni Mimenu"), it is eaten in joy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Akiva says, "Matzos" includes [Ma'aser Sheni].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what do we learn from "Lechem Oni"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It excludes a dough kneaded with wine, oil or honey.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Akiva's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Lechem Oni" is written without a Vov, so we can read it 'Ani' (with a Komatz, a poor person) - had it been written with a Vov, we would have to read it 'Oni'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>R. Yosi ha'Gelili argues, because it is pronounced "Oni," not 'Ani'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>R. Akiva explains the pronunciation like Shmuel:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> "Lechem Oni" - Onim (we recite) many things on account of it (Hallel and Hagadah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THINGS THAT CAN SPEED CHIMUTZ</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Akiva allows a dough kneaded with wine, oil or honey!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> During Pesach, one may not knead a dough with wine, oil or honey;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if one did so, one must burn it immediately (it becomes Nuksheh very quickly - one cannot prevent this);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chachamim say, it may be eaten (if it was baked promptly).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Akiva says, I once made a dough for R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua [during Pesach] with wine, oil and honey, and they did not comment.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Even though one may not knead with them, one may smear the dough after it is arranged into loaves;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is according to the first Tana</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Chachamim say, one may smear only with things with which one may knead.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>All forbid kneading with lukewarm water (this speeds Chimutz).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He disqualifies it on the first night [when it is an obligation to eat "Lechem Oni"], and permits on the second day (the rest of Pesach - he is not concerned for Chimutz);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua (to his children):</span> Do not knead for me with milk on the first day - afterwards, you may do so.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Beraisa):</span> We may not knead a dough with milk; if this was done, all the bread is forbidden, lest it be eaten with meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, he told them not to knead with honey on the first day, but afterwards they may.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, he allowed to knead with milk after the first day, like Ravina taught:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Ravina permits the amount of an ox's eye (such a small amount will be finished before people forget that it is dairy) - R. Yehoshua permitted an amount like this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> All agree that one may not knead with lukewarm water.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> All Menachos are kneaded with lukewarm water (Tif'eres Yisrael - this is best for bread, but it speeds up Chimutz); we must guard them from becoming Chametz (standard Menachos may not be Chametz).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We permit lukewarm water for Menachos, for they are made by Zerizim (zealous people, i.e. Kohanim) - we do not permit [regarding Pesach, which applies to everyone, including] people that are not Zerizim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Lesisah (soaking wheat before pounding to remove the bran, to make nice Soles) should also be permitted - but Shmuel forbids this for Menachos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If we would permit Lesisah, it would be done by people (Yisraelim) that are not Zerizim - kneading is done by Zerizim (Kohanim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Kneading is not done [exclusively] by Zerizim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Va'Yitzok Aleha Shemen...; Ve'Hevi'ah El Benei Aharon ha'Kohanim [v'Komatz]," from Kemitzah and onwards, Kohanim must do the Avodah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This teaches that anyone may pour the oil and knead it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Even though kneading is not done by Zerizim, it is done in the place of Zerizim (the Mikdash):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It was taught that a Zar may knead, but if it was kneaded outside the Azarah it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Lesisah is not done by Zerizim, nor in the place of Zerizim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this different than the Omer?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We Loses [barley for] the Omer and make a pile of it [so the water will drain off].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Korban Tzibur is different (Beis Din supervises everything).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MATZAH OF BIKURIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one is Yotzei with Bikurim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (R. Yosi ha'Gelili):</span> "<i>B'Chol Moshvoseichem</i> Tochlu Matzos" - one is Yotzei only with Matzah which may be eaten anywhere; Bikurim must be eaten in Yerushalayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (R. Akiva):</span> The verse equates Matzah and Maror - just like Maror cannot be from Bikurim (Bikurim applies only to the seven species of Eretz Yisrael, none of which are bitter), also Matzah.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">36b----------------------------------------36b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Matzah cannot be from wheat and barley, for Bikurim applies to them [but not to Maror]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Matzos" includes them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Matzos includes even Bikurim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> R. Akiva retracted [and learned like R. Yosi ha'Gelili]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one may be Yotzei with Bikurim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "B'Chol Moshvoseichem" - one is Yotzei only with Matzah which may be eaten anywhere - Bikurim must be eaten in Yerushalayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one is not Yotzei with Ma'aser Sheni [for the same reason]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Matzos" includes Ma'aser Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> [These verses do not specify what to include or exclude -] why do we include Ma'aser Sheni and exclude Bikurim, and not vice-versa?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We include Ma'aser because it has a Heter b'Chol Moshvos (anywhere, if it became Tamei and was redeemed), like R. Elazar taught; we exclude Bikurim, for it has no Heter b'Chol Moshvos.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Tamei Ma'aser Sheni can be redeemed even in Yerushalayim [since it cannot be eaten] - "Ki Lo Suchal <i>Se'eiso</i>" refers to eating, like it says "Va'Yisa <i>Mas'os</i> me'Es Panav."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>This Beraisa is like R. Akiva, who says that one is Yotzei with Ma'aser Sheni, and it excludes Bikurim from "B'Chol Moshvoseichem" - this shows that he retracted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yosi ha'Gelili should exclude Bikurim from "Lechem Oni" - Matzah that is permitted b'Aninus!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like R. Shimon:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Bikurim are forbidden to an Onen;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon permits.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's source?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Lo Suchal Le'echol bi'Sh'arecha [Masar...u'Srumas Yadecha]" - "U'Srumas Yadecha" is Bikurim, and they are Hukshu (equated) to Ma'aser [Sheni] - just like Ma'aser is forbidden to an Onen, also Bikurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Shimon says that they are called Terumah to teach that just like Terumah is permitted to an Onen, also Bikurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, R. Shimon does not expound the Hekesh - but the Torah explicitly says that they are eaten in joy - "V'Somachta b'Chol ha'Tov"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That teaches that one recites the Parashah ("Arami Oved Avi...") only during the period of joy [over the harvest]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> From Shavu'os until Sukos, one who brings Bikurim recites the Parashah; from Sukos until Chanukah one may bring, but he does not recite. (One may not bring afterwards, for the fruits are no longer in the field for Chayos.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>BREAD OF POVERTY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Lechem Oni" - not [esteemed bread, e.g.] scalded or Ashisha (a big bun);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one is Yotzei only with coarse [bran] bread!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Matzos" includes even like Shlomo's [of fine flour].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say "Lechem Oni"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This excludes scalded or a big bun.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Ashishah denotes esteemed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [When David returned the Aron, he gave to everyone] "...V'Eshpar Echad va'Ashishah Echas";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanan bar Aba):</span> ESHPaR is Echad of SHishah (a sixth) of a PaR (ox); ASHiSHaH is [a bun the volume of 72 eggs,] Echad of SHiShaH of an Eifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Chanan argues with Shmuel:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Ashisha is a barrel of wine - "V'Ohavei Ashishei Anavim."</p></div>
