<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They hold like R. Binyamin bar Yefes:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Binyamin bar Yefes citing R. Yochanan):</span> We bless on fire on Motza'ei Shabbos and on Motza'ei Yom Kipur.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> We bless on fire only on Motza'ei Shabbos, for, that is when it was created; one blesses immediately upon seeing it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, one says them (the Berachos on fire and fragrances) over a cup [of wine].</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Rebbi used to scatter them (he would say the Berachos on fire and fragrances at the first opportunity for each); R. Chiya would gather them (say them together over a cup with the Berachah of Havdalah).</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THINGS CREATED AT THE BEGINNING AND AT THE END</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Was fire really created on Motza'ei Shabbos?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Ten things were created on Erev Shabbos Bein ha'Shemashos - the well (that accompanied Benei Yisrael in the Midbar), the manna, the rainbow, the [forms of the] letters [in the Luchos], the engraving [of the letters on the Luchos], the Luchos, the burial place of Moshe, the cave in which Moshe and Eliyahu stood [when Hash-m passed by], the opening of the mouth of Bil'am's donkey (Bartenura - the decree that it would talk), and the opening of the earth's mouth to swallow Resha'im (Korach's congregation - see note in Appendix);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Nechemyah says, also fire and a mule [were created then - one cannot make a new species by crossbreeding - "V'Ein Kol Chadash Tachas ha'Shamesh." Seemingly, we could answer that the first Tana holds that fire was created on Motza'ei Shabbos - perhaps it was known that <i>all</i> agree to this!]</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yoshiyah says, also the ram [offered in place of Yitzchak], the Shamir (a worm that can bore through anything hard, it was used to carve the names of the Shevatim on the stones of the Choshen).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, also tongs - to make tongs, one needs tongs [to hold the metal while beating it] - only Hash-m could create the first pair!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yoshiyah:</span> Perhaps tongs were made by man - molten metal was poured into a mold!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Earthly fire was created on Motza'ei Shabbos; fire of Gehinom was created on Erev Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The fire of Gehinom was not created on Erev Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Seven things were created before the world - Torah, repentance, Gan Eden, Gehinom, the Kisei ha'Kavod, the Beis ha'Mikdash, and the name of Moshi'ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Torah - it says "Hash-m Konani Reishis [Darko Kedem Mif'alav me'Az ";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>'Repentance - it says "B'Terem Harim Yuladu," and "Teshev Enosh Ad Daka va'Tomer Shuvu Venei Adam;"</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span><p>The name of Moshi'ach - "Yehi Shemo l'Olam Lifnei Shemesh Yinun Shemo" (his name (Yinun) existed before the sun).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The pit of Gehinom was created before the world, its fire was created on Erev Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The fire of Gehinom was not created on Erev Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> The fire Hash-m created on the second day will never be extinguished - "Ha'Anashim ha'Posh'im Bi...v'Isham Lo Sichbeh" (the most severe sinners are punished eternally - normally, punishment in Gehinom is at most 12 months - Rosh Hashanah 17A).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Bana'ah) Question:</span> Why doesn't it say "Ki Tov" on the second day?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The fire of Gehinom was created that day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Even though it doesn't say "Ki Tov" on the second day, the creations of that day are included in "Va'Yar Elokim Es Kol Asher Asah v'Hine Tov Me'od" (it is good that Resha'im be judged).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the pit of Gehinom was created before the world, its fire was created on Yom Sheni; Hash-m had intent to create earthly fire on Erev Shabbos, but He did not create it until Motza'ei Shabbos:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> Hash-m had intent to create two things on Erev Shabbos, but He did not create them until Motza'ei Shabbos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>On Motza'ei Shabbos He gave to Adam a semblance of Divine wisdom, and brought two rocks to him - Adam rubbed them together and fire came out;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He brought two animals to him - Adam mated them and a mule resulted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, mules arose in the days of Anah - "Hu Anah Asher Motzo Es ha'Yemim ba'Midbar."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Expounders of secretive verses explain that Anah himself was a Mamzer, therefore he brought 'Mamzerim' (crossbred animals) to the world. (Even though the Isur of Mamzer does not apply to Benei Noach, there is a spiritual blemish.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> It says "Eleh Benei Se'ir ha'Chori...v'Tziv'on v'Anah" (Tziv'on was his brother) - it also says "V'Eleh Venei Tziv'on v'Ayah v'Anah" (Tziv'on was his father)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Tziv'on had relations with his mother, and fathered Anah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps there were two people named Anah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava or Rav Papa):</span> "Hu Anah" - he is the same Anah mentioned previously ("Venei Tziv'on v'Ayah v'Anah").</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Ten things were created on Erev Shabbos Bein ha'Shemashos - the well, the Manna, the rainbow, the letters, the engraving, the Luchos, the burial place of Moshe, the cave in which Moshe and Eliyahu stood, the opening of Bil'am's donkey's mouth, and the opening of the earth's mouth to swallow Resha'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Some say, also Aharon's staff and its almonds and flowers [which sprouted after Korach's rebellion];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Some say, also Mazikim (harmful spirits);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Some say, also Adam ha'Rishon's garment [which later passed to Nimrod and Esav; perhaps it was the leather cloak Hash-m made for him].</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">54b----------------------------------------54b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Seven things are hidden from a person - the day of death, the day of consolation [from his worries], the exactness of Din (judgment for seemingly miniscule misdeeds - Mesilas Yesharim Perek 4; alternatively, the profundity of monetary cases), what another person is thinking, how he will earn a living, when Malchus Beis David will return, and when the evil Malchus (Romi) will end.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> There are three things for which Hash-m intended, and had He not intended, it would have been fitting for Him to intend:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Corpses should rot (otherwise, people would leave dead relatives around and constantly feel sorrow).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>People should forget about one who died;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Grain should rot (otherwise, farmers would hoard it, and others would be hungry).</p></div>
