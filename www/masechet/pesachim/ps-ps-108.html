<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>PREPARING TO EAT MATZAH WITH APPETITE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A Mishnah teaches that wine arouses appetite:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may drink between these (the first two of the four) cups; one may not drink between the third and fourth cups (it looks like one adds to the enactment of four cups).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If wine satiates, it should be forbidden between the first two cups, lest he eat Matzah Achilah Gasah! (Rashbam - it would be forbidden on account of adding to the enactment, if it did not arouse appetite for Matzah! This does not apply between the third and fourth cups, which are after the Matzah was eaten.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Rather, wine arouses appetite. (Tosfos - this refers to a large amount, but a small amount satiates.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rav Sheshes used to fast every Erev Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He holds that the Mishnah forbids shortly before Minchah Gedolah, lest the meal get drawn out and he will neglect to offer Pesach, and he holds like R. Oshaya, who says that Ben Beseira is Machshir a Pesach slaughtered in the morning of the 14th;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Also the morning is Kosher for slaughter - the time for Pesach is the entire day;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He explains that Bein ha'Arbayim means between the Erev of the previous day (after the end of the night, i.e. dawn) until the [beginning of] today's Erev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No - Rav Sheshes fasted because his nature was such that if he would eat [even earlier] during the day, he would not have appetite at night.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN IS RECLINING OBLIGATORY?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Even the poorest Yisrael may not eat until he reclines.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Matzah requires reclining [while eating it, for it symbolizes freedom]; Maror does not (it symbolizes slavery).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Rav Nachman holds that wine requires reclining;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> He does not require reclining for wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>These versions do not argue - one refers to the first two cups, the other refers to the last two cups.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version A:</span> The first two cups require reclining, for they begin the [recounting of] freedom; the last two cups do not require reclining, for we already reclined to show freedom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version B:</span> The last two cups require reclining, for then [after saying the Berachah of redemption] we are free; the first two cups do not require reclining, for then we say Avadim Hayinu (we were slaves).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Since we are unsure which require reclining, we must recline for all of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Lying on one's back is not considered reclining;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Reclining on the right side is not considered reclining (it is inconvenient to eat with one's right hand this way) - further, it is dangerous, lest the food enter the windpipe instead of the esophagus (Rashbam).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>A woman [in front of her husband - some delete this from the text] need not recline (his fear is upon her); if she is esteemed, she must recline.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>A son in front of his father must recline.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must a Talmid in front of his Rebbi recline?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Abaye taught that in Rabah's house, we (Talmidim) would recline on each other's knees; in Rav Yosef's house, he said that we need not recline - the fear of one's Rebbi is like fear of Shomayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One reclines in any case, even a Talmid in front of his Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to an apprentice carpenter (he does not fear his teacher).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must a waiter recline?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehoshua ben Levi taught that if a waiter ate a k'Zayis of Matzah while reclining, he was Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he ate without reclining, he was not Yotzei!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE FOUR CUPS OF WINE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Women must drink four cups of wine, for <i>even</i> they were saved by the miracles [of Yetzi'as Mitzrayim, e.g. Kri'as Yam Suf, even though the harshest decrees were against the men - "Im Ben Hu va'Hamiten Oso," "Tichbad ha'Avodah Al ha'Anashim" - Maharam Chalavah; Sefas Emes (Megilah 4A); Rashi - Yetzi'as Mitzrayim was in their merit.]</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">108b----------------------------------------108b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The four cups of wine must contain enough wine to mix a nice cup. (Wine used to be very strong; it was normally diluted with two or three times its own volume of water.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If one drank them undiluted, he was Yotzei; if one drank them at once (Rashi - from one big cup; Rashbam - he did not drink according to the Mishnayos (116A and onwards) - the last three cups must follow Hagadah, Birkas ha'Mazon and Hallel).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If one gave from them to his household to drink, he was Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one drank them undiluted, he was Yotzei the Mitzvah of wine, but he was not Yotzei Cherus [the ideal Mitzvah, to drink the way free men drink].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one drank them at once he was Yotzei the Mitzvah of [Simchah on Yom Tov by drinking] wine, but he was not Yotzei the four cups.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> If one gave from the cup to his household to drink, he was Yotzei - this is only if he drank the majority (Ramban; Tosfos - Malei Lugmav, which for most people is the majority of a Revi'is, the Shi'ur for the cup).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Yehudah - Beraisa):</span> The four cups must contain a Revi'is, whether it is mixed or undiluted; it can be new or old;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it must have the appearance of wine and the taste of wine (this excludes new wine; Sanhedrin 70A - wine less than 40 days is not addicting).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> The Beraisa requires a Revi'is altogether, but Rav Yehudah requires only enough (a <i>quarter</i> Revi'is) to mix a nice cup (a Revi'is) in all! (Rashi; Tosfos - the Beraisa requires a Revi'is in each cup, and Rav Yehudah requires only a quarter Revi'is in each!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> These are the same - Rav Yehudah means, each cup must have enough to mix a nice cup, in all they hold a Revi'is (Rashi; Tosfos - Rav Yehudah requires each cup to have a Revi'is after it is mixed - the Beraisa also requires this)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> It must have the taste and appearance of wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> He learns [about appearance] from "Al Tere Yayin Ki Yis'adam."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Everyone must drink four cups - men, women and children;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> Why give wine to children?! (Ran - they do not enjoy it, and it does not show freedom.) Rather, we give to them parched grain and nuts on Pesach night, in order that they will stay awake and ask.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>R. Akiva used to do so.</p></div>
