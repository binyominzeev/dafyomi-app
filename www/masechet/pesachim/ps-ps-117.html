<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Therefore, we are obligated [...and we will say Halleluyah].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Each of the following is one word (we do not say that the 'Yud-Kei' at the end is a separate word) - Halleluyah, Kesyah (Hash-m's throne), at the end of Parashas Beshalach) and Yedidyah (the name Noson called Shlomo - Shmuel 2:12:25);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Kesyah and [ba']Merchavyah (an expanse - Tehilim 118:5) are each one word;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> Only Merchavyah is one word.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Rav Chisda say about Merchavyah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>This question is not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Rav say about Yedidyah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav taught that Yedidkah is two words - therefore, Yedid is profane and Kah is Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Rav say about Hallelukah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav said that he saw Sefer Tehilim in R. Chiya's house - Hallelu was written at the end of a line, and Kah at the beginning of the next line.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>He argues with R. Yehoshua ben Levi:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Halleluyah means, praise Him with many praises (it is one word).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>R. Yehoshua ben Levi contradicts himself! (R. E. M. Horowitz - he holds that sometimes it is one word, and sometimes two.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Tehilim uses 10 words to denote praise - Nitzu'ach, Nigun, Maskil, Mizmor, Shir, Ashrei, Tehilah, Tefilah, Hoda'ah, and Hallelukah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Hallelukah is the greatest - it combines praise and Hash-m's name itself.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHO WROTE HALLEL?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Surely, Shiras ha'Yam was first sung by Moshe and Yisrael when they left Yam Suf;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who enacted saying Hallel [on Rosh Chodesh and festivals]?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Nevi'im enacted to say it at every festival and every time Yisrael are saved from distress.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> David wrote all the praises in Tehilim - "<i>Kalu</i> Tefilos David Ben Yishai" - we read this 'Kol Elu'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who composed Hallel?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar ben R. Yosi):</span> Moshe and Yisrael sang it when they left Yam Suf;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Chachamim):</span> David wrote it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> Presumably, my son is right - surely, [even before David] Yisrael sang Hallel while offering Pesach or taking the Lulav!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Also - Yisrael would not [begin to] say Hallel [which demeans idolatry] when Michah's idol was in Bechi [in the days of David! Rather, they started saying it in the days of Moshe, and never ceased.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> David said all songs and praises in Tehilim on account of events in his own life;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Yehoshua says, he said them for Yisrael [to request redemption from their future exile];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Chachamim say, some are for Yisrael, and others are on account of himself:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Those in the singular (e.g. "Koli El Hash-m Ez'ak") were on account of himself; those in the plural (e.g. "Az Yimalei Sechok Pinu") are for Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>'Nitzu'ach' and 'Nigun' (e.g. "La'Mnatze'ach bi'Nginos," Tehilim 4,6,...) allude to the future.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"Maskil" means that David would whisper to one who would broadcast his words to a multitude.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>"L'David Mizmor" teaches that the Shechinah (Ru'ach ha'Kodesh) rested on David, then he sang;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>"Mizmor l'David" teaches that he sang, then Shechinah rested on him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>This teaches that Shechinah does not rest [on a person] amidst laziness, sadness, frivolity, lightheadedness or idle words, only amidst Simchah of a Mitzvah - "Kechu Li Menagen...va'Tehi Alav Yad Hash-m."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The same applies to Halachah (one must learn amidst Simchah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> [Going to sleep amidst] Simchah is also the means to a good dream.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Yehudah):</span> But Rav Gidal taught that if a Talmid learns from his Rebbi and his lips are not dripping with bitterness [on account of awe], his lips should be burned!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "Sifsosav Shoshanim Notfos Mor Over" - we read this 'she'Shonim Notfos Mar' (learning lips drip with bitterness).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Rebbi should teach amidst Simchah, the Talmid must be in awe.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Rebbi should begin amidst Simchah, afterwards he must be in awe.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rabah would begin with something amusing to make the Talmidim jovial - afterwards he would teach amidst awe.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> Who said Hallel (Rashbam - first)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Eliezer):</span> Moshe and Yisrael said it when they left Yam Suf;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They said "Lo Lanu Hash-m Lo Lanu" (Maharsha - not for our sake do we request salvation, for we lack merit - rather, save us for Your honor); Hash-m answered "L'Ma'ani l'Ma'ani E'eseh."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehudah):</span> Yehoshua and Yisrael said it when the kings of Eretz Yisrael opposed them - they said "Lo Lanu..." and Hash-m answered "L'Ma'ani..." [and similarly for the coming answers].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Eliezer ha'Moda'i):</span> Devorah and Barak said it when Sisera attacked;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Elazar ben Azaryah):</span> Chizkiyah and his contemporaries said it when Sancheriv attacked;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5 (R. Akiva):</span> Chananyah, Misha'el and Azaryah said it when Nebuchadnetzar threw them into the furnace;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #6 (R. Yosi ha'Gelili):</span> Mordechai and Esther said it when Haman decreed to destroy Yisrael;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #7 (Chachamim):</span> Nevi'im enacted to say it at every festival and every time Yisrael are saved from distress.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HALLELUYAH BETWEEN PERAKIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> [When it says "Halleluyah" once between chapters of Tehilim,] Halleluyah ends the previous Perek;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> It begins the next Perek.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> I saw Sefer Tehilim in Rav Chanin bar Rav's house - Halleluyah was written in the middle of a Perek;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Chanin was unsure whether it ends the previous Perek or begins the next Perek.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chanin bar Rava):</span> All agree that Halleluyah following "Tehilas Hash-m Yedaber Pi...l'Olam va'Ed" (the last verse of Tehilim 145 - in prayer, we say "Va'Anachnu Nevarech Kah..." afterwards, but this is from a different Perek) begins the next Perek;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The Halleluyah following "Rasha Yir'eh v'Cha'as...Ta'avas Resha'im Toved" begins the next Perek, also the one after "She'Omdim b'Veis Hash-m...";</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Experts in written Torah add the ones after "Mi'Nachal ba'Derech Yishteh..." and "Reishis Chachmah Yir'as Hash-m..."</p></div>
