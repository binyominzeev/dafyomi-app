<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHY IS ONE LIABLE FOR A PASUL SLAUGHTER?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he slaughtered Pesach Lo l'Ochlav...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Obviously, since the Korban is Pasul he is liable [for Chilul Shabbos]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This is for parallel structure with the Seifa, which exempts [for l'Ochlav and Lo l'Ochlav].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also that is obvious - since the Korban is Kosher he is exempt!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, it is for parallel structure with the Reisha, which obligates for Lo Lishmah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also the Reisha is obvious [since it is Pasul]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Reisha was taught to introduce the argument of R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua [about other Korbanos l'Shem Pesach - but all agree about Pesach Lo Lishmah].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna bar Chinena):</span> According to the opinion that one who wounds unproductively is exempt, why is one liable for slaughtering Lo l'Ochlav - it is not productive!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [Regarding Pesulim that apply only in the Mikdash] 'Im Alu Lo Yerdu' (if the Chelev was brought on the Mizbe'ach it is offered, it is not brought down).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If he slaughtered and found that it has a Mum, he is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>What did the slaughter accomplish?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mum was a film over the eye - this is like R. Akiva, who says 'Im Alu Lo Yerdu' about such [minor] Mumim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If he slaughtered it and then found that it has an internal Tereifah, he is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If it was openly Tereifah, he is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>What did the slaughter accomplish? (R. Akiva admits that we never offer a Tereifah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The slaughter prevents the animal from becoming [Tamei like a] Neveilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina - Beraisa):</span> If on Shabbos one slaughtered a Chatas outside the Mikdash for idolatry, he brings three Chata'os.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>What did the slaughter accomplish? (The carcass is forbidden and Tamei because it was offered to idolatry!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Avira):</span> Slaughter makes it cease to be Ever Min ha'Chai (it is now permitted to Nochrim).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>IS AKIRAH NEEDED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he slaughtered it and then found [that the owners withdrew...]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna citing Rav):</span> If an Asham (which cannot be offered, e.g. the owner offered a different animal for his Asham) was Nitak (given to a shepherd) to graze [until it becomes blemished, and to buy Nedavah (Olos of the Tzibur) with its Damim (redemption money)] and slaughtered Stam (without special intention), it is a Kosher Olah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that Akirah is not needed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, also Nituk should not be required!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, letter of the law it is not needed [after the owner got Kaparah by offering a different animal for his Asham] - Chachamim decree to require Nituk after Kaparah on account of before Kaparah (then it is still an Asham).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> If the owner of an Asham died, or if he brought a different animal in place of it [because it was lost], the Asham grazes and the Damim is used for Nedavah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer says, it must die;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehoshua says, Olah is brought with the Damim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Olah is brought with the Damim, but it itself is not offered for an Olah - we decree after Kaparah on account of before Kaparah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda - Mishnah):</span> If he slaughtered it and then found that the owners withdrew...</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">73b----------------------------------------73b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If this happened on a weekday, it would be burned immediately.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We understand this if Akirah is required - it is a Pesach without owners, which is Pesul ha'Guf (intrinsically Pasul), therefore it is burned immediately;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>But if Akirah is not required, it is automatically a Shelamim - it is not Pesul ha'Guf, rather, because it was slaughtered after the afternoon Tamid - it should require Ibur Tzurah (to become Nosar before burning it)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Any Pesul ha'Guf is burned immediately; if it is Pasul on account of the blood or the owners, it is burned in Beis ha'Sereifah after Ibur Tzurah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, Rav Huna must have said that if it (an Asham Nitak to graze) was slaughtered l'Shem Olah, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that Akirah is needed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Chiya bar Gamda said that Akirah is needed when the owners were Tamei Mes on Pesach and detained to Pesach Sheni (the Korban is destined to be offered l'Shem Pesach Sheni);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A normal Pesach [which cannot be offered l'Shem Pesach] does not need Akirah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>How can he answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> [Really, Rav Huna is Machshir even if it was slaughtered Stam;] the case is, the Pesach was Hukdash before midday and the owners died after midday;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It was Nir'eh v'Nidcheh (it was once Kosher to be offered, then it became Pasul) - this can never become Kosher again (therefore, Ibur Tzurah is not required).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We seek to explain Rav's teaching - Rav holds that a living being is never Nidcheh (when the Pesul goes away, it is Kosher again)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> The Beraisa is R. Eliezer, who says (Zevachim 2A) that another Korban slaughtered l'Shem Pesach is Pasul, it is Pesul ha'Guf (it is not on account of the owner or blood).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If it is R. Eliezer, he should be Chayav Chatas, for R. Eliezer does not exempt one who erred due to obsession with a Mitzvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Yosef brei d'Rav Sala Chasida):</span> The Beraisa is Yosef ben Chunai:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Yosef ben Chunai):</span> Any other Korban slaughtered l'Shem Pesach or Chatas is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is Pesul ha'Guf - therefore, Ibur Tzurah is not required;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He exempts [one who erred due to obsession with a Mitzvah] like R. Yehoshua.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rav Ashi):</span> Rav holds like R. Yishmael, son of R. Yochanan ben Brokah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael, son of R. Yochanan ben Brokah):</span> If there was time during the day to find out that the owners withdrew, died, or became Temei'im, he is liable; it is burned in Beis ha'Sereifah after Ibur Tzurah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is not burned immediately because it does not need Akirah (it was a Shelamim; the only Pesul is that it was slaughtered after the afternoon Tamid)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps he holds like Tana d'vei Rabah bar Avuha, who says that even Pigul requires Ibur Tzurah - he learns from a Gezerah Shavah "Avon-Avon" from Nosar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> We must say this to explain when the owners became Temei'im - surely Akirah is needed (the Korban can be brought for Pesach Sheni)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Gamda):</span> The case is, the owners were Tamei Mes on Pesach and detained to Pesach Sheni - therefore it needs Akirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must rely on Answer #4, the Beraisa is Yosef ben Chunai.</p></div>
