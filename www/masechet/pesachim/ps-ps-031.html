<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DOES A LENDER COLLECT RETROACTIVELY?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>All agree that if the borrower sold or was Makdish, the lender takes [the property from the buyer] or redeems it [from Hekdesh for a token amount. Really, it is not Hekdesh at all - one cannot sell or Makdish something not under his jurisdiction - just we do not want it to <i>look</i> like Hekdesh becomes Chulin without redemption.]</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He (the lender) 'lends' another Dinar, uses it to redeem the property, and keeps the property.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>They argue about when the lender sold or was Makdish:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Abaye says that a lender collects retroactively - when the due date comes and payment was not made, this shows that retroactively the property belonged to the lender - it was a proper sale or Hekdesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rava says that he collects from now - since the borrower could have paid money and kept his property, it is as if the lender buys the property now [so his prior sale or Hekdesh is invalid].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava contradicts himself!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rami Bar Chama):</span> Reuven sold a field to Shimon with Acharayos (responsibility to compensate him if it is taken by a creditor), and Shimon [could not pay and] wrote a document for what he owes. Reuven died, and Reuven's creditor Levi took the field from Shimon; Shimon persuaded Levi to take money in place of the field.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Reuven's children can say to Shimon, you owed [money, i.e.] Metaltelim (movable property, i.e. not land) to our father, and a creditor has no lien on Metaltelim of orphans (Levi had no rights to collect the money you owe us, so you still must pay us. We did not inherit land, therefore we need not pay you on account of the Acharayos of our father's sale.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Shimon is clever, he will pay the orphans with land, and he can collect compensation from it, like Rav Nachman taught:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If orphans collected land for their father's debt, a creditor of their father can collect from it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If a lender collects retroactively, we understand why the creditor can collect from it - it is as if the orphans collected it in their father's lifetime;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>But if a lender collects from now, why can he collect from it - it is as if the orphans bought property after their father died - their father's creditor cannot collect such property!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rami's case is different, because Shimon can say, just like I owed your father, I owed his creditor, on account of R. Noson's law:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Noson):</span> "V'Nosan la'Asher Asham Lo" - this teaches that if Levi owes David and David owes Moshe, we take from Levi to pay Moshe.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If a Nochri lent to a Yisrael on the Yisrael's Chametz, it is permitted after Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a lender collects retroactively, we understand why it is permitted (it is as if the Nochri owned it during Pesach);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But if a lender collects from now, why it is permitted - the Yisrael owned it during Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the Chametz was deposited in the Nochri's residence during Pesach (R. Chananel - payment was due before Pesach; Rashi does not require this).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue as Abaye and Rava do:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Yisrael lent to a Nochri on the Nochri's Chametz, after Pesach one does not transgress [if he benefits from it];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir says, he transgresses.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The first Tana holds that a lender collects from now, and R. Meir holds that he collects retroactively!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This cannot be!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If a Nochri lent to a Yisrael on the Yisrael's Chametz, after Pesach all agree that one transgresses.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Each Tana should say the opposite from the Reisha - if he does not transgress there, he should transgress here, and vice-versa!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">31b----------------------------------------31b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Rather, the case is, the borrower put the Chametz in the lender's Reshus - they argue about R. Yitzchak's law:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> A lender acquires a security - "U'Lecha Tihyeh Tzedakah";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he did not acquire it, returning it would not be called Tzedakah (since it belongs to the borrower)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The first Tana holds that this is only when "U'Lecha Tihyeh Tzedakah" applies, i.e. to a Yisrael who lent to a Yisrael - but a Yisrael does not acquire a security from a Nochri;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Meir learns a Kal va'Chomer - if a Yisrael acquires a security of a Yisrael, all the more so he acquires a security from a Nochri!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>But if a Nochri lent to a Yisrael on the Yisrael's Chametz, after Pesach all agree that one transgresses - surely, a Nochri does not acquire a security from a Yisrael!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Nochri lent to a Yisrael on the Yisrael's Chametz, it is permitted after Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, we can say that the borrower put the Chametz in the lender's Reshus - but all agree that a Nochri does not acquire a Yisrael's security!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the Mishnah, when he put the Chametz in the lender's Reshus, he said '[If I do not pay you by the due date, it is yours] from now'; in the Seifa of the Beraisa he did not say 'from now'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that it makes a difference whether or not he said 'from now'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If a Nochri borrowed from a Yisrael and put a big bread in the Yisrael's Reshus [for collateral], the Yisrael does not transgress on account of it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he said 'it is yours', the Yisrael transgresses.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the Reisha and Seifa?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that in the Seifa he said 'from now', but in the Reisha he did not say 'from now' - this makes a difference!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven's bread and wine are sold in Shimon's store, and Nochri workers bring Chametz there, Chametz found there after Pesach is Asur b'Hana'ah; there is no need to say that one may not eat it (we do not say that it was the workers');</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>If a Nochri's bread and wine are sold in a Nochri's store, and Yisrael workers bring Chametz there, Chametz found there after Pesach may be eaten, there is no need to say that one may benefit from it (we assume that it was the Nochri's);</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>BURIED CHAMETZ</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a house collapsed on top of Chametz, it is as if Bi'ur was done.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, this is when a dog could not find the Chametz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Chisda):</span> One must Mevatel it [lest it be unearthed and he would transgress Bal Yera'eh and Bal Yimatzei].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A dog can find [buried Chametz] up to three Tefachim [deep].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Yosef):</span> Shmuel taught that the only proper place to guard money is in the ground - must one bury it at least three Tefachim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> A dog can smell Chametz, therefore three Tefachim are required - but we bury money so it will not be visible, so three Tefachim are not required.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How deeply must money be buried?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rafram bar Papa):</span> One Tefach is required.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ONE WHO ATE WORTHLESS TERUMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Zar (non-Kohen) ate Chametz of Terumah on Pesach b'Shogeg, he pays Keren (principal, the amount he ate) and Chomesh (and an added fifth - see note in Appendix).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he ate b'Mezid he is exempt from payment, even from its value as [fuel in place of] wood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara -Mishnah):</span> If a Zar ate Terumah b'Shogeg, he pays Keren v'Chomesh; this applies to one who eats, drinks or anoints, whether the Terumah was Tahor or Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He pays the Chomesh and [if he eats the Chomesh b'Shogeg after giving it to the Kohen, which makes it Terumah] a Chomesh of the Chomesh.</p></div>
