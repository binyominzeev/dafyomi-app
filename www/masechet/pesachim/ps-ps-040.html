<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THINGS THAT WILL NOT BECOME CHAMETZ (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> One may not Cholet two grains of wheat at the same time - perhaps one will be in a crack of the other, and the heat of the water will not reach it from all sides [to Cholet properly], and it will become Chametz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> One may not roast two ears of grain at the same time - perhaps juice will leave one and be absorbed in the other, and it will become Chametz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If so, even one should be forbidden - perhaps juice will leave one end and be absorbed in the other end, and it will become Chametz!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rather, we are not concerned [in either case] because Mei Peiros cannot cause Chimutz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Abaye retracted [and permitted for a different reason], because nothing become Chametz while falling:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If grain was parched in a jug in an oven:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the mouth faces down [so juice that exudes will fall out], it is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If the mouth faces up, it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> In both cases it is permitted - Mei Peiros do not Mechametz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not Loses barley (soak it before removing the bran) during Pesach; if one did:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the kernels split, they are forbidden; if not, they are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Yosi says, [if one sees them inflating] he soaks them in vinegar - this impedes Chimutz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The Beraisa does not mean that they truly split - rather, they would split by themselves if put on top of a barrel of wine [on account of the smell; Tosfos - if put on top of a porous Keli on which grain is parched, they would split on account of the heat].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It means that they truly split.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>A case occurred - Shmuel was lenient, because they had not truly split.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> A Ba'al Nefesh (one who goes beyond the letter of the law; alternatively - fears Shomayim) will not Loses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa forbids everyone to Loses barley during Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rabah means that a Ba'al Nefesh will not Loses even wheat, which is hard [and does not become Chametz so quickly. On 48A, Tana'im argue about whether dough of wheat or barley is more prone to become Chametz - perhaps all agree that Lesisah is more prone to Mechametz barley.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> One who heeds Rabah eats moldy (i.e. inferior) Matzah! They Loses in the houses of Rav Huna and Rava bar Avin!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>IS LESISAH PERMITTED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It is forbidden to Loses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa forbids to Loses barley - this implies that one may Loses wheat!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa teaches a bigger Chidush:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Not only wheat, which has cracks, is forbidden - rather, even barley, which is smooth, is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction (Rava):</span> It is permitted to Loses:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One is Yotzei with bread that is clean or coarse.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The only way to make clean bread is through Lesisah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa - Beraisa):</span> Flour and Soles of Nochrim - that of villages is Tahor; that of cities is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>That of villages is Tahor because Lesisah was not done - nevertheless, it can be Soles (from which one can make clean bread)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> No, the Beraisa is Metaher only flour of villages (Soles is found only in the cities, where they Loses).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (after Rava left - Rav Papa):</span> R. Zeira taught that we do not Loses wheat of Menachos, even though Soles is required!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction (Rava):</span> It is a Mitzvah to Loses - U'Shmartem Es ha'Matzos - if we need not Loses, why must we guard the Matzos?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It cannot refer to Shmirah during kneading - this is not considered Shmirah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> One may gorge himself on dough of Nochrim [on the first night], as long as he eats a k'Zayis of Matzah [of Yisraelim] at the end. (The dough was baked afterwards - otherwise, one is not Yotzei even with a Yisrael's, for it is not Lechem! Rashi - the Nochri made the dough, the Yisrael can see that it is not Chametz; Ritva - a Yisrael supervised that it was done properly - some say that Shimur of a Yisrael while the Nochri kneads would suffice.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Matzah must be at the end [when he eats it with Pesach, when satiated, and intends to fulfill the Mitzvah], not at the beginning - the Nochri dough is invalid, because it was not Shamur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He could Shomer it after it was baked!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that Shmirah must be from the beginning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Nochri dough is invalid because it was not Shamur from when this is necessary (when it became wet) - but it suffices to Shomer from this time, i.e. of kneading!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>In spite of this question, Rava did not retract [from requiring Shmirah before kneading]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rava told people who were turning over sheaves [and tying them in bundles] to do so l'Shem Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This shows that he requires Shmirah from the beginning until the end.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Mar brei d'Ravina's mother was Shomer wheat for him in troughs from the beginning of the harvest.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">40b----------------------------------------40b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>A ship carrying wheat capsized in a river [before Pesach]; Rava permitted to sell the wheat to Nochrim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar Livai - Beraisa):</span> If Sha'atnez was lost in a garment, one may not make it into a saddle [lest he remove it and sew it into another garment] or sell it to a Nochri, but it may be used for shrouds (one may not benefit from shrouds).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He may not sell it to a Nochri lest the Nochri resell it to a Yisrael [since the Isur is not evident - similarly, we should be concerned lest the Nochri resell the wheat to a Yisrael, since the Chimutz is not evident. Normally, Yisraelim may buy wheat from Nochrim to use for Pesach - presumably, Nochrim are careful to keep it dry, lest it spoil!]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>Rava retracted and commanded to sell it to Yisraelim, a bit to each buyer, in order that it would be finished before Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DOES VINEGAR IMPEDE CHIMUTZ?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not put flour in a Tavshil [off the fire. We explain like R. David; see note in Appendix.]</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is permitted if he first puts in flour [while it is on the fire - this is Chalitah] and then vinegar;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Some say, he may put the flour in after the vinegar [which is always added after it is removed from the fire - even so, the vinegar is Cholet].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the latter Tana?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is R. Yehudah (R. David - all the more so it is like Chachamim that argue with him, they say that even without vinegar a Keli Rishon cooks even off the fire, and hence is Cholet):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one removed a frying pan or pot from the fire, one may not put spices into it [on Shabbos];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One may put spices into a bowl (a Keli Sheni, into which food that was on the fire was poured).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it is always permitted [to put spices in a Keli Rishon], unless it contains vinegar or brine [for then it can cook; it can also Cholet].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We could establish it to be R. Yosi!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> [If one sees the barley inflating] he soaks it in vinegar - this impedes Chimutz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi teaches that pure vinegar impedes Chimutz - we have no source that he says so about a mixture of vinegar [and a Tavshil].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> It is forbidden whether the vinegar was put first or last on account of 'Lech Lech Amrinan Nezira...' (a Nazir should stay far from a vineyard; similarly, everyone must distance himself from sin)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Rav Papi permitted bakers of the Reish Galusa's house to thicken a Tavshil with Chasisi (Rashi - parched flour; Rif - Matzah meal; Tosfos - lentil flour).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rava:</span> Does one permit such a matter in a place where slaves [who are not careful about Mitzvos] are found?! (Perhaps they will use wheat flour that was not fully parched or baked!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Rava himself thickened a Tavshil with Chasisi.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>FLOUR PUT INTO CHAROSES OR MUSTARD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not put flour into Charoses (a dip containing vinegar - this is not the dip used at the Seder) or mustard - if one did so, he should eat it immediately [before it will become Chametz];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Meir forbids eating it (see note in Appendix).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One may not cook Korban Pesach with liquids or Mei Peiros, but one may smear it with or dip it in them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The water a baker uses [to cool his hands] must be spilled out, for it becomes Chametz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Kahana):</span> They argue about flour put into mustard - but all agree that if flour was put into Charoses it must be burned immediately.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> One may not put flour into Charoses - if it was put, it must be burned immediately;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir says, if flour was put into mustard, it must be burned immediately;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, he should eat it immediately.</p></div>
