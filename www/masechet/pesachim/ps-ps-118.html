<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We finish Hallel over the fourth cup, and say <i>Birkas ha'Shir</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is 'Yehalelucha Hash-m Elokecha' (the closing Berachah of Hallel);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> 'Nishmas Kol Chai' is also part of (Tosfos; Rambam - is also called) Birkas ha'Shir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Tarfon):</span> We finish Hallel over the fourth cup, and say Hallel ha'Gadol.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Some say, we say "Hash-m Ro'i Lo Echsar."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Hallel ha'Gadol?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is [Tehilim 136, i.e.] from "Hodu [la'Shem Ki Tov]" until [but not including] "Al Naharos Bavel;"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> It from "Shir ha'Ma'alos" (the last one, Tehilim 134 - Yerushalmi) until "Al Naharos Bavel;"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> It is [Tehilim 135 and 136,] from "Ki Yakov Bachar Lo Kah" until "Al Naharos Bavel." (In our Tehilim, "Ki Yakov..." is verse 135:4 - presumably, Rav Acha considered it the beginning of a Perek - see Tosfos 117A and Yefe Einayim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it called Hallel ha'Gadol?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It says ["Nosen Lechem l'Chol Basar,"] that Hash-m from above gives food to all creations.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> The 26 repetitions [of "Ki l'Olam Chasdo"] in Hodu correspond to the 26 generations from creation until Matan Torah - during that time Hash-m's Chesed fed the world (Maharsha - normally, one should not feed an ignoramus - Bava Basra 8A).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda) Question:</span> How do we understand "Hodu la'Shem Ki Tov"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Thank Hash-m who collects a person's liability through the good that He gave him - He takes the ox of a rich man, the goat of an Oni, the egg of an orphan, or the hen of a widow (the monetary loss atones for the person).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>'DIFFICULT' CHASADIM OF HASH-M</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> [Obtaining] food is twice as hard as birth - regarding birth it says "B'Etzev [Teldi Vanim]," and regarding food it says "B'Itzavon (double pain) [Tochalenah]." (This teaches how much one must pray for food!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Food is harder than redemption!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A simple angel brings redemption - "Ha'Mal'ach ha'Go'el Osi" - but Hash-m Himself gives food - "Ha'Elokim ha'Ro'eh Osi."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> When Hash-m told Adam "V'Kotz v'Dardar Tatzmi'ach Lach," he cried profusely - 'Will I eat from the same trough (i.e. the same food) as a donkey?!'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When Hash-m said "B'Ze'as Apecha Tochal Lechem," he was assuaged.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> It would have been better had man borne the first decree (we would not need to toil for food)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We still have a remnant of that situation - we eat still vegetation of the field [without toil - it grows by itself].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> We are fortunate that we did not bear the first decree [to eat the same food as animals].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We still have a remnant of that situation - we eat still vegetation of the field [like animals]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shizbi):</span> Providing food is as 'hard' as Kri'as Yam Suf - it says "Nosen Lechem l'Chol Basar" shortly after "L'Gozer Yam Suf li'Gzarim." (Ha'Rif - the 'difficulty' of Kri'as Yam Suf was to overcome the prosecution that Yisrael had also sinned and were not worthy of a miracle - likewise, it is 'difficult' to feed Resha'im`)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar ben Azaryah):</span> Constipation is painful like the day of death, and [then] eliminating is as hard as Kri'as Yam Suf - it says "Miher Tzo'eh (this is like Tzo'ah with an Aleph, excrement) Lehipase'ach [v'Lo Yamus la'Shachas]," and then "Roga ha'Yam va'Yehemu Galav."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> One who disgraces the festivals (he works on Chol ha'Mo'ed; Rambam (on Avos) - he does not honor Yom Tov) is like one who serves idolatry - right after "Elohei Masechah Lo Sa'aseh Lach" it says "Es Chag ha'Matzos Tishmor."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> One who speaks or believes Lashon ha'Ra or testifies falsely should be cast to dogs - right after "La'Kelev Tashlichun Oso" it says "Lo Sisa Shema Shav" (do not bear a vain or false report) - we [also] read this "Lo Sasi" (do not cause others to bear it. Rashbam - "Lo Sisa" itself connotes one who speaks it - he bears it on his lips.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since Hallel ha'Gadol is so special, why was standard Hallel enacted [for festivals and salvations]?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Standard Hallel mentions five matters - Yetzi'as Mitzrayim, Kri'as Yam Suf, Matan Torah, revival of the dead, and the birthpangs of Moshi'ach:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Yetzi'as Mitzrayim - "B'Tzeis Yisrael mi'Mitzrayim;"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Kri'as Yam Suf - "Ha'Yam Ro'oh va'Yanos;"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Matan Torah - "He'Harim Rokdu ch'Eilim;"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Techiyas ha'Mesim - "Es'halech Lifnei Hash-m;"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Chevlei Moshi'ach - it says "Lo Lanu Hash-m Lo Lanu"</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> This refers to subjugation by the [four] kingdoms.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> This refers to the war of Gog and Magog.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It teaches that Tzadikim are spared from Gehinom - "Anah Hash-m Moltah Nafshi."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Chizkiyah):</span> It alludes to Tzadikim (Chananyah, Misha'el and Azaryah) entering a fiery furnace and emerging:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When descending, Chananyah said "Lo Lanu Hash-m Lo Lanu;" Misha'el said "Ki l'Shimchah Ten Kavod;" Azaryah said "Al Chasdecha v'Al Amitecha;" all of them said "Lamah Yomru ha'Goyim;"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>When ascending, Chananyah said "Hallelu Es Hash-m Kol Goyim;" Misha'el said "Shabchuhu Kol ha'Umim;" Azaryah said "Ki Govar Aleinu Chasdo;" all of them said "V'Emes Hash-m l'Olam Halleluyah."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Some say that Gavri'el said "V'Emes Hash-m l'Olam Halleluyah:"</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>When Nimrod threw Avraham into the furnace, Gavri'el asked Hash-m permission to cool it and save him; Hash-m refused - 'I am unique in My world, and he is unique in his - it is fitting that the Unique save the unique';</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Hash-m does not withhold the reward of any creature - He told Gavri'el that he may save three of Avraham's descendants.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ha'Shiloni):</span> When Nebuchadnetzar threw Chananyah, Misha'el and Azaryah into the furnace, the angel of hail asked Hash-m permission to cool it and save them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Gavri'el:</span> You will not demonstrate Hash-m's might - everyone knows that water extinguishes fire! I am the angel of fire - I will cool the furnace from the inside and heat it from the outside [to burn those who throw them in], it will be a double miracle!</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Hash-m agreed; Gavri'el said "V'Emes Hash-m l'Olam Halleluyah:</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Noson):</span> Fish in the sea said this verse:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> In that generation [of Yetzi'as Mitzrayim], Yisrael had little faith in Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Mari):</span> "Va'Yamru Al Yam b'Yam Suf" - Yisrael rebelled and said, just like we came up from the sea, the Mitzriyim will come up from another side!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Hash-m told the Sar (angel) of the sea to spit the Mitzriyim onto the dry land.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">The Sar:</span> Does a Master give a gift to His slave, and take it back?! (I want the Mitzriyim to be food for the fish!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> I will return to you one and a half times as much (this will be explained)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">The Sar:</span> A slave is too embarrassed to claim from his Master (perhaps You will have mercy on them and not give them to me)!</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>The sea spit them up - "Va'Yar Yisrael Es Mitzrayim Mes Al Sefas ha'Yam."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Hash-m say that He will return one and a half times as much?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Paro's army had 600 chariots - "Shesh Me'os Rechev Bachur;" Sisera's army had 900 - Tesha "Me'os Rechev Barzel."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Sisera came against Yisrael with soldiers in iron armor; Hash-m took the stars out of their paths [to defeat them] - "Min ha'Shomayim Nilchamu ha'Kochavim;"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The stars descended and made the armored soldiers very hot; they entered Nachal Kishon to cool off; Hash-m told Nachal Kishon to repay the loan for which it was a guarantor - it cast them to the sea - "Nachal Kishon Gerafam Nachal Kedumim;"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Nachal Kedumim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is the Nachal (river) that was a guarantor mi'Kedem (from of old).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [The most pious part of] Keneses Yisrael says to Hash-m, Your children [through their sins in exile] made me [lowly] like a weasel that dwells in IKaRei Batim (underneath houses).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Keneses Yisrael says to Hash-m, I am beloved to You when You hear Tachanunai (my supplications.

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> When R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi fell sick, Rebbi asked him to retell some his father's teachings:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yishmael citing R. Yosi) Question:</span> It says "Hallelu Es Hash-m Kol Goyim [Ki Govar Aleinu Chasdo]" - why should they praise Hash-m [on account of what He did for us]?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They should praise Hash-m for His mighty and wondrous acts for them - all the more so we should praise Him, for His Chesed with us has been overwhelming!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yishmael citing R. Yosi):</span> In the future, Mitzrayim will bring a gift to Moshi'ach, thinking that he will not accept from them - Hash-m will tell him to take it, for they hosted His children - "Ye'esayu ha'Shemanim Mini Mitzrayim;"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Kush will make a Kal va'Chomer - Mitzrayim enslaved Yisrael, nevertheless Moshi'ach accepts from them - we did not enslave Yisrael, all the more so he will accept from us! Hash-m will tell him to accept - "Kush Taritz Yadav lEi'lokim."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>The evil kingdom [Romi] will make a Kal va'Chomer - they are not the brothers of Yisrael, nevertheless Moshi'ach accepts from them - we are their brothers, all the more so he will accept from us! Hash-m will tell Gavri'el "Ge'ar Chayas Kaneh [Adas Abirim]" - reprimand an animal (the evil nation) and acquire for yourself a congregation (Yisrael);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Alternatively - reprimand an animal that dwells among Kanim (reeds) - "Yecharsemenah Chazir mi'Ya'ar v'Ziv Sadai Yir'enah."</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>"Misrapes b'Ratzei Chesef" - they Matir Pas (open their hands) to take money, and do not fulfill the deal [for which they took tribute];</p></div>
