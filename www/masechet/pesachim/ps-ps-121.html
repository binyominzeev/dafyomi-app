<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Pigul and Nosar are Metamei hands.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna or Rav Chisda):</span> This is [a decree] on account of Kohanim who are suspected [of intentionally being Mefagel Korbanos];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Huna and Rav Chisda):</span> This is on account of lazy Kohanim (they are not zealous to eat their portion in time).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The first opinion explains the decree about Pigul; the latter opinion explains the decree about Nosar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna or Rav Chisda):</span> A k'Zayis is Metamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Huna and Rav Chisda):</span> A k'Beitzah is Metamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>The first opinion says that the Shi'ur of [liability for the] Isur is the Shi'ur for Tum'ah; the second opinion adopts the usual Shi'ur for Tum'ah of food.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>BLESSING ON PESACH AND CHAGIGAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yishmael):</span> If one blessed for the Mitzvah of eating Pesach, he need not bless for the Zevach (Chagigah of the 14th); if he blessed for the Zevach, he must also bless for Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Akiva says, neither of them exempts the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> (The Torah requires Shefichah [pouring on the Mizbe'ach] for blood of Pesach, and Zerikah (throwing) for Shelamim.) R. Yishmael holds that Shefichah is considered [a form of] Zerikah (therefore, if one poured Dam of the Zevach like a Pesach, he was Yotzei - hence, a Berachah on Pesach exempts Chagigah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, Zerikah is not a form of Shefichah (if one threw Dam Pesach like a Shelamim, he was not Yotzei, so a Berachah on Chagigah does not exempt Pesach. Igros Moshe (Choshen Mishpat 1:108 u'Fele) sharply questions Rashi, who says here that we discuss the <i>leftover</i> blood; elsewhere, e.g. 89A, Rashi himself holds that we discuss the primary Matanos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Akiva holds that neither is a form of the other.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">121b----------------------------------------121b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Simlai went to a Pidyon ha'Ben (redemption of a firstborn son).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously, the father blesses Asher Kidshanu b'Mitzvosav v'Tzivanu Al Pidyon ha'Ben (it is his Mitzvah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Does the Kohen [who receives the money] bless Shehecheyanu, or the father?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Perhaps the Kohen blesses, for he benefits;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Or, perhaps the father blesses, for he does a Mitzvah! (Rashash - the Berachah is fitting for both of them - we ask which should bless to exempt the other, this is similar to our Mishnah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Simlai did not know.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabanan of Beis Medrash):</span> The father blesses both.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>The Halachah is, the father blesses both.</p></div>
