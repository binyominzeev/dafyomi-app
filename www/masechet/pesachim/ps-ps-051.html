<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Benei Chuzai used to separate Chalah from rice [bread].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> A Zar should eat rice 'Chalah' in front of them [to show that it is not Chalah].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> If some people [mistakenly] forbid certain things, you may not permit them to them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Rav Chisda taught that this refers to Kusim (Nochrim whom Sancheriv settled in place of the exiled 10 Shevatim - lions were eating them, so they converted, but they did not keep many of the Mitzvos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One may not permit things to Kusim, lest they come to be lenient about other things [that are truly forbidden] - the same applies here!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> If most of the bread they eat is rice bread, a Zar should not eat rice 'Chalah' in front of them, lest [amidst not separating anything] they will forget the law of Chalah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If most of the bread they eat is not rice bread, a Zar should eat rice 'Chalah' in front of them, lest they [think that Chalah applies to rice bread, and they will] separate Chalah from [dough that is] liable on behalf of [what is truly] exempt, or vice-versa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If some people [mistakenly] forbid certain things, you may not permit them to them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> This refers to Kusim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It applies to others also!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Two brothers may bathe together; in Kavul (a certain place), they do not;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It once happened that two sons of R. Gamliel, Hillel and Yehudah, bathed together there - the whole region was in an uproar - 'this was never done here'!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Hillel [left the bath and] went to the outer room - he did not want to tell them that it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>People may go out with light shoes on Shabbos; in Biri, people do not;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>It once happened that Hillel and Yehudah went out with light shoes on Shabbos in Biri - the whole region was in an uproar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Hillel and Yehudah removed them and gave them to their slaves [to wear] - they did not want to tell them that it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>One may sit on benches of Nochrim [on which merchandise is sold] on Shabbos; this is not done in Ako.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>It once happened that R. Shimon ben Gamliel sat on such a bench on Shabbos in Ako - the whole region was in an uproar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>He got off - he did not want to tell them that it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since Chachamim are scarcely found overseas, people there are [unlearned] like Kusim. (Regarding Gitin; some consider places where people are ignorant like Chutz la'Aretz; Tana'im argue about whether or not Ako is considered like Eretz Yisrael (2A-B).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand why Benei Ako do not sit on the benches - people might suspect that they are doing business;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We understand why Benei Biri do not go out with light shoes on Shabbos - they might come to take them off and carry them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But why shouldn't brothers bathe together?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> One may bathe with anyone, except for his father, father-in-law, step-father or his sister's husband [lest this cause him to think about procreation];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah permits with one's father, in order to honor the father [to serve him in the bathhouse]; the same applies to his stepfather.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>People in Kavul decreed about two brothers on account of one's sister's husband.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Talmid may not bathe with his Rebbi - if the Rebbi needs the Talmid, it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ADOPTING STRINGENCIES OF A NEW RESIDENCE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>When Rabah bar bar Chanah came to Bavel, he ate De'aisra (Chelev on the 'bow' (bent side) of the stomach - Benei Eretz Yisrael eat it, Benei Bavel do not eat it). Rav Avira Sava and Rabah bar Rav Huna came to see him - he covered it up.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rav Avira and Rabah bar Rav Huna told Abaye; he told them 'He treated you like Kusim (he did not want you to see that it is permitted)!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rabah bar bar Chanah did not follow our Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ...He must be stringent like his old and new residences.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> That only applies to one who goes from one place to another in Eretz Yisrael, or from one place to another in Bavel, or from Bavel to Eretz Yisrael;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It does not apply to one who goes from Eretz Yisrael to Bavel - since Bavel is subservient to Eretz Yisrael (Semichah (ordination) is only in Eretz Yisrael), he may keep his old practice.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> We can even say that one who goes from Eretz Yisrael to Bavel gets both stringencies - but only if he intends to stay there;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rabah bar bar Chanah intended to return to Eretz Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rabah bar bar Chanah (to his children):</span> Do not eat [De'aisra], not in front of me and not in my absence;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>I saw R. Yochanan eat it - he is so esteemed that I can rely on him to eat in front of him and in his absence;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>You did not see R. Yochanan - you may not eat in front of me or in my absence.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rabah bar bar Chanah contradicts himself!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah citing R. Yochanan ben Elazar):</span> I once followed R. Yosi ben Lekunya to a garden; he took Sefichim (things that grow by themselves) of cabbage [in Shemitah, after Bi'ur (Rashi) or even before (Tosfos)], ate some, and gave to me - he told me that I may eat, but only in front of him;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">51b----------------------------------------51b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>I (R. Yosi ben Lekunya) saw R. Shimon eat - he is so important that I can rely on him to eat in front of him and in his absence;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>You (R. Yochanan ben Elazar, since you did not see R. Shimon) may eat only in front of me. (The contradiction is not resolved.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Shimon permit?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> All Sefichim are forbidden, except for Sefichim of cabbage, which is unique among vegetables (Rashi - it has no Bi'ur, for it is never finished in the field; Tosfos - it remains in the ground and grows more leaves, like trees that grow fruits each year - other Sefichim come from seeds that fell);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim forbid all Sefichim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Both of them hold like R. Akiva.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva) Question:</span> "Hen Lo Nizra v'Lo Ne'esof Es Tevu'asenu" - if we may not seed in Shemitah, there is nothing to harvest (why must the Torah mention both?)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This forbids Sefichim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim and R. Shimon argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim decree to forbid Sefichim of cabbage on account of other Sefichim [that are forbidden mid'Oraisa]; R. Shimon does not decree.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ONE MAY NOT DEVIATE FROM THE LOCAL PRACTICE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who goes from a place [where people work...or vice-versa... he may not deviate...]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand if in his old residence they work and in the new place they do not, we apply the stringency of the new place; and he may not deviate [from the local custom] lest this cause strife - therefore, he does not work;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But if in the old place they did not work and in the new place they do, since he may not deviate [from the local custom] he must work - but it also says that he follows the stringencies of both places!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> 'He may not deviate' refers only to the Reisha (in the old place they work).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> It applies to the Seifa - it means that [also here, he follows the stringencies of both places and does not work, even though this is unlike the local custom -] the Isur to deviate is solely to avoid strife, and here deviating will not cause strife;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps people who see him will say that he [disputes their practice and] forbids working!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, they will assume that he is like many other people that do not work [all year round].</p></div>
