<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>FROM WHOSE PESACH DOES A WIFE EAT?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When a woman is living with her husband, if her husband and father both slaughtered Pesach for her, she eats from her husband's Korban (we assume that she wanted to be Nimneh on it);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If she went to her father's house the first festival [after Nisu'in], and both slaughtered for her, she eats from whichever she wants.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If overseers of an orphan slaughtered for him, he eats from whichever he wants.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If a slave had two masters and both of them slaughtered for him, he may not eat from either one [unless one master allowed him to be Nimneh with the other];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>A half-slave may not eat from his master's Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> Our Mishnah teaches that Yesh Breirah (things can take effect retroactively - at night she decides which Korban she wants to eat, and it is as if she was Menuyah on it from the time of slaughter)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No - it means that she eats from whichever she <i>wanted</i> [at the time of slaughter].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> The first Pesach [after Nisu'in] she eats from her father's Korban; after this, she eats from whichever she wants.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> The Beraisa discusses a woman who constantly visits her father's house, and the Mishnah discusses a woman who does not;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Az Hayisi v'Einav k'Motz'eis Shalom" - [Yisrael is to Hash-m] like a Kalah that is found Shleimah (perfect) in her father-in-law's house, and is constantly running to her father's house to recount her praise.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "V'Hayah va'Yom ha'Hu Ne'um Hash-m Tikre'i Ishi v'Lo Tikre'i Li Od Bali" - [Yisrael will be to Hash-m] like a Kalah in her father-in-law's house (i.e. after Nisu'in), not like a Kalah in her father's house [during engagement].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Achos Lanu Ketanah v'Shadayim Ein Lah" - this is Eilam (the province in which is Shushan), that merited to learn Torah (Daniel and Mordechai were there), but not to teach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Ani Chomah" - this is Torah; "v'Shodai ka'Migdalos" - these are Chachamim (they nurture Talmidim and protect the generation like towers);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Ani Chomah" is Keneses (the congregation of) Yisrael; "v'Shodai ka'Migdalos" are synagogues and Batei Medrash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar Zutri bar Tuvya) Question:</span> What does it mean "Asher Baneinu ki'Nti'im...?"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refers to male youths of Yisrael that never sinned;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Benoseinu ch'Zaviyos" refers to Benos Yisrael that bind their [genital] openings for their husbands (they do not have relations with anyone else);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We learn from "U'Mal'u ka'Mizrak k'Zaviyos Mizbe'ach" (Benos Yisrael are full of desire, but contain it for their husbands), or from "Mezaveinu Mele'im Mefikim mi'Zan."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><i>T</i>"<i>avnis</i> Heichal" - the verse attributes to both of them that it is as if the Heichal was Nivneh (built) in their days.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>"Devar Hash-m...El Hoshe'a...bi'Yemei Uziyah Yosam Achaz Yechizkiyah" - four prophets prophesized in this period - the greatest was Hoshe'a:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Techilas Diber Hash-m b'Hoshe'a" - [why is it called the first time Hash-m spoke to a prophet -] there were many Nevi'im between Moshe and Hoshe'a!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> He was the foremost of four Nevi'im that prophesized in his time - Hoshe'a, Yeshayah, Amos and Michah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Hash-m told him 'Your children sinned' - Hoshe'a should have answered 'They are <i>Your</i> children, descendants of your dear ones, Avraham, Yitzchak and Yakov!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>He did not do so - moreover, he said 'Master of the world - the entire world is Yours - switch them with another nation!' (We infer this from what Hash-m commanded him.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> How should I make this Chacham understand [the absurdity of his suggestion]?! I will tell him to have Safek children from a harlot (he will not know whether or not they are really his); afterwards, I will tell him to send her away - if he can do so, I will send away Yisrael!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "Kach Lecha Eshes Zenunim v'Yaldei Zenunim...;"  "Va'Yelech va'Yikach Es Gomer" - she is called Gomer because everyone was Gomer (fulfilled his lust) with her;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Bas <i>Divlayim</i>" (plural) - she and her mother were both evil;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">87b----------------------------------------87b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> "Divlayim" teaches that she was sweet in everyone's mouth like a Develah (pressed fig);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Divlayim" teaches that everyone threshed (an allusion to relations) with her, like Develah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> She is called Gomer because they (Nochrim) sought to finish off the money of Yisrael in her days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> They looted and finished off the money of Yisrael - "[Lo Hish'ir li'Ho'achaz...] Ki Ibdam Melech Aram va'Ysimem ke'Afar Ladush."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>She bore a son to him - Hash-m said 'call him Yizre'el, for soon I will punish Beis Yehu [and Zore'a (plant) Yisrael in exile] to avenge the blood of [Achav, who was killed in] Yizre'el';</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>She bore a daughter to him - Hash-m said 'call him Lo Ruchamah, for I will not have mercy on them again - will I bear their sin?!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>She bore another son to him - Hash-m said 'call him Lo Ami, for you are not My nation, and I am not yours'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>After this, Hash-m said 'separate from her - you should have learned from Moshe, who separated from his wife after I spoke with him!' (See note in Appendix.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Hoshe'a:</span> I have children from her, I cannot expel or divorce her!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> You cannot leave your harlot wife and her children, even though you cannot be sure that they are yours - all the more so I cannot switch another nation for Yisrael My sons, the sons of those I tested, the sons of Avraham, Yitzchak and Yakov, one of four [things so important that I call them the] acquisitions I made in My world:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Torah - "Hash-m Konani Reishis Darko;" Heaven and earth - "Kone Shomayim va'Aretz;" the Beis ha'Mikdash - "Har Zeh Konsah Yemino;" Yisrael - "Am Zu Konisa."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>Hoshe'a realized that he had sinned; he asked Hash-m to forgive him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> Before you ask Me to forgive you, ask forgiveness for Yisrael - I made three decrees about them [when giving names to your children] on account of you!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>Hoshe'a asked forgiveness for Yisrael; Hash-m annulled the decrees and blessed them:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"V'Hayah Mispar Benei Yisrael k'Chol ha'Yam...bi'Mkom Asher Ye'amer Lahem Lo Ami Atem Ye'amer Lahem Benei Kel Chai," "V'Nikbetzu Benei Yehudah u'Venei Yisrael Yachdav," "U'Zratiha Li ba'Aretz v'Richamti Es Lo Ruchamah v'Omarti l'Lo Ami Ami Atah." (Radak (1:2) - Hoshe'a never actually married a harlot - this entire account was merely a prophecy to help him understand his mistake.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HASH-M'S MERCY NEVER CEASES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Woe to authority - it causes early death! Every Navi [of the four] outlived four kings - "Chazon Yeshayah...[bi'Mei Uziyah Yosam Achaz Yechizkiyahu Malchei Yehudah]."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan) Question:</span> Why did Yarav'am ben Yo'ash, a king of Yisrael, merit to be listed with Malchei Yehudah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is because he did not accept Lashon ha'Ra about Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where do we find that he is listed with Malchei Yehudah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Devar Hash-m...El Hoshe'a...bi'Mei Uziyah Yosam Achaz Yechizkiyahu Malchei Yehudah uvi'Mei Yarav'am ben Yo'ash Melech Yisrael."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where do we find that he did not accept Lashon ha'Ra?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Va'Yishlach Amatzyah...El Yarav'am...Koshar Alecha Amos...; Ko Amar Amos ba'Cherev Yamus Yarav'am;"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Yarav'am:</span> Heaven forbid that that Tzadik would say so (I am the third generation from Yehu - Hash-m promised four generations of kings from him)! And if he said so, Hash-m told him to say so (perhaps the promise was conditional, and will not be fulfilled on account of sin - Maharsha)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Even when Hash-m is angry, He remembers mercy - "Ki Lo Osif Od Arachem Es Beis Yisrael" (which can be read 'I will not continue; I will again have mercy' - had it said 'Lerachem', it could only be read 'I will not continue to have mercy').</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> We learn from "Naso Esa Lahem" (even though it was said in astonishment, the simple reading is 'I will bear their sin').</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Hash-m exiled Yisrael among the nations in order that converts will added onto them - "U'Zratiha Li ba'Aretz" - one plants a Se'ah only because he expects to reap many Korim (a Kor is 30 Sa'im. See note in Appendix)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> We learn from "V'Richamti Es Lo Ruchamah [v'Omarti l'Lo Ami Ami Atah]" - people that were not My nation will become my nation.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Because the generation curses its father and does not bless its mother, therefore one should not slander it [to Hash-m]?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, one should not slander even such a generation.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to say this?</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m did Tzedakah by being MeFaZeR (spreading) amidst the nations [so they could not wipe out Yisrael]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">A [Nochri] heretic [to R.

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> If you want, a Talmid will answer you.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Oshaya:</span> You did not do anything to us because you did not know what to do!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>You cannot wipe us out - not all of Yisrael is in your nation;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>You would not want to wipe us what is amidst you - then you would be called a truncated kingdom [that killed many of its subjects]!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>(R. Chiya) "Elokim Hevin Darkah v'Hu Yoda Es Mekomah" - Hash-m knew that Yisrael could not endure the vicious decrees of Edom, so he exiled [most of] them to Bavel instead [after the first Churban];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Hash-m exiled Yisrael to Bavel only because it is as deep as Gehinom [from which He promised to redeem them] - "MiYad She'ol Efdem mi'Maves Eg'alem."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> He exiled Yisrael to Bavel because its language (Arame'ic) is similar to Lashon ha'Kodesh [this helps to remember Torah].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R.Yochanan):</span> He exiled them to their motherland (Maharsha - it is where Avraham was saved from Nimrod's furnace and grew in Emunah; Gilyonei ha'Shas - it is the origin of Chavah, who was created from Adam's Tzela);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like a man who gets angry at his wife - he sends her to her mother's house.</p></div>
