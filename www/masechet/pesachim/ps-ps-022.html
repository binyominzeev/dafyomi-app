<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>QUESTIONS AGAINST R. AVAHU</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Yehudah learns from "La'Kelev Tashlichun <i>Oso</i>" - you may give a Tereifah to dogs (you may benefit from it, even though you may not eat it), but you may not benefit from other Isurei Achilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir [does not need to learn this from here - he] expounds you may give <i>it</i> to dogs, but not Chulin b'Azarah (Chulin slaughtered in the Mikdash, for it is Asur b'Hana'ah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah holds that mid'Oraisa, one may benefit from (Rashi; Tosfos - one may slaughter) Chulin b'Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> Regarding Gid ha'Nasheh it says "Al Ken Lo Yochlu Venei Yisrael Es Gid ha'Nasheh" (yet one may benefit from it)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven may send a thigh to a Nochri with the Gid ha'Nasheh inside, because [even if Shimon knows that Reuven sent it and will buy it from the Nochri, Shimon will not assume that the Gid was removed, for] it is recognizable that it was not removed. (Even if Reuven sends the leg for free, the Nochri will show more appreciation for receiving a nicer thigh - Reuven benefits from the Gid!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Avahu holds that when the Torah permitted [to give a Neveilah to a Ger to eat, this permits benefit from [every edible part, including the Chelev and] the Gid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is according to the opinion that the Gid has taste - but according to the opinion that it has no taste [nevertheless, the Torah obligates for eating it] how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who holds that it has no taste?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon says so:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> One who eats the Gid of a Tamei animal receives two sets of lashes [for eating a Gid, and for eating meat of a Tamei animal - he holds that the Gid has taste];</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Shimon says, he is not lashed (he holds that the Torah did not forbid the Gid of a Tamei animal, and that the Gid has no taste, it is not considered as if he ate meat of a Tamei animal).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, R. Shimon forbids benefit from the Gid!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> One may benefit from the Gid ha'Nasheh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon forbids.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Kol Nefesh Michem Lo Sochal Dam," yet one may benefit from it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Leftover blood of both of these (outer Chata'os and inner Chata'os) flows together into the stream [that runs through the Mikdash,] and flows into Nachal Kidron (a valley); gardeners buy it, Me'ilah applies to it (Tosfos - mid'Rabanan, if one uses it without paying Hekdesh; Rambam - mid'Oraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Blood is different because it is equated to water - "Lo Tochalenu Al ha'Aretz Tishpechenu ka'Mayim;"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like water is permitted, blood is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it is like water poured on the Mizbe'ach [on Sukos, which is forbidden]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Avahu):</span> It is like most water, which is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The verse does not say that it is like most water!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> It is like water that is spilled, not like water that is Nisach (poured for a libation, which is forbidden).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it is like water that is spilled in front of idolatry, which is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is also called Nisuch - "Yishtu Yayin Nesicham."</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>QUESTIONS AGAINST R. AVAHU AND CHIZKIYAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Chizkiyah [there was no reason to think that blood is Asur b'Hana'ah], why is blood equated to water?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches R. Chiya bar Aba's law:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba) Question:</span> What is the source that blood of Kodshim is not Machshir?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Lo Tochalenu Al ha'Aretz Tishpechenu ka'Mayim" - only blood which is spilled like water is Machshir [but not blood of Kodshim, which is caught in a Keli to be thrown on the Mizbe'ach].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding Ever Min ha'Chai (a limb from a living animal) it says "V'Lo Sochal ha'Nefesh Im ha'Basar" (yet one may benefit from it)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Noson) Question:</span> What is the source to forbid extending wine to a Nazir or Ever Min ha'Chai to a Ben Noach?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Lifnei Iver Lo Siten Michshol" (do not cause someone to sin).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It is permitted to give Ever Min ha'Chai to a dog!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ever Min ha'Chai is equated to blood - "Rak Chazak l'Vilti Achol ha'Dam Ki ha'Dam Hu ha'Nefesh" (we learned that one may benefit from blood).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Chizkiyah, why is Ever Min ha'Chai equated to blood?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Blood is equated to Ever Min ha'Chai - just like Ever Min ha'Chai is forbidden, also blood [Min ha'Chai] is forbidden [like blood from a dead animal, i.e. with Kares].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which blood does this refer to?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to blood let [from a living animal] in which the Nefesh leaves (Dam ha'Nefesh is as long as it is flowing, or from the first black drop and onwards).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding Shor ha'Niskal (an ox sentenced to be stoned) it says "V'Lo Ye'achel Es Besaro" [but this did not suffice forbid Hana'ah - even Chizkiyah holds that v'Lo Ye'achel forbids Hana'ah]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> "Sakol Yisakel ha'Shor" - since it is stoned, it becomes a Neveilah, one may not eat it - why must it say "V'Lo Ye'achel Es Besaro"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Lo Ye'achel Es Besaro" forbids eating it [even] if it was slaughtered after it was sentenced.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source forbidding benefit from it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "U'Va'al ha'Shor Naki."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we learn this from the verse?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shimon ben Zoma):</span> This is like people say, Ploni was wiped clean of his property and got no benefit from it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If not for "U'Va'al ha'Shor Naki," we would have forbidden only eating on account of "V'Lo Ye'achel Es Besaro," not Hana'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, "V'Lo Ye'achel Es Besaro" forbids eating and Hana'ah - "U'Va'al ha'Shor Naki" forbids benefit from the skin - both of these must be taught:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it only taught "V'Lo Ye'achel Es Besaro" we would have said that this forbids only the meat, but not the skin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (If an animal Muchzak to gore kills a person, the owner must pay Kofer (the value of himself or the victim); if a man hit a pregnant woman and caused her to miscarry, he pays her husband the value of the fetus aborted.) Other Tana'im expound "U'Va'al ha'Shor Naki" differently, to exempt [the owner of] an animal not established to gore from [even] half Kofer, and the owner of any animal from paying for a fetus - what is their source to forbid benefit from the skin?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Lo Ye'achel <i>Es</i> Besaro" - this includes what is secondary to the meat, i.e. the skin;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>The Tana of the Beraisa [who expounds "U'Va'al ha'Shor Naki"] does not expound "Es":</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Shimon ha'Amsoni used to expound every 'Es' in the Torah [to include something]; for "Es Hash-m Elokecha Tira," he found nothing to include [that should be feared like Hash-m].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">His Talmidim:</span> If so, how can you justify what you expounded from [other occurrences of the word] 'Es'!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> Indeed, I retract all of them! Just as I will receive reward for what I expounded (at the time, I believed that it was true), I will be rewarded for retracting.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> "Es Hash-m Elokecha Tira" includes [fearing] Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding Orlah it says "Arelim Lo Ye'achel";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> "Arelim Lo Ye'achel" forbids eating - what is the source to forbid benefit from Orlah, using it for dye or to burn a lamp? (Tosfos - one might have thought that even though normal Hana'ah is forbidden, one may benefit from it while destroying (burning) it, or that dying (small Hana'ah) is permitted; Rashi - one might have thought that shells (which are used to dye) are permitted.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Va'Araltem Orlaso...Arelim Lo Ye'achel" forbids all of these.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If not for Va'Araltem Orlaso...Arelim Lo Ye'achel, we would have forbidden only eating, not Hana'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, "Lo Ye'achel" normally forbids eating and Hana'ah - regarding Orlah we would have permitted Hana'ah because it says "Lachem."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that "Lachem" teaches that it is yours [to benefit from] - "Va'Araltem..." teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
