<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>SITUATIONS WHEN WE DO NOT RELY ON HO'IL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Lechem ha'Panim is never eaten before the ninth day [from when it was baked], and never later than the 11th:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Normally [Erev Shabbos is not Yom Tov], it is baked on Erev Shabbos and eaten on the following Shabbos, the ninth day;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Erev Shabbos is Yom Tov, they are baked the previous day and eaten on the 10th day;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If Rosh Hashanah falls on Thursday and Friday, they are baked Erev Rosh Hashanah and eaten on the 11th day (see note in Appendix).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>This is because [baking] Lechem ha'Panim does not override Shabbos or Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>If [mid'Oraisa] one may cook on Yom Tov for Shabbos, they should be baked on Yom Tov! (Tosfos - Rav Chisda holds that the Torah permits preparing on Yom Tov for any Mitzvah if there will not be time after Yom Tov.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [Indeed, it is only Shevus (an Isur mid'Rabanan) to cook on Yom Tov for Shabbos -] Chachamim permitted a near Shevus [for Shabbos that is right after Yom Tov, through Eruv Tavshilim], they did not permit a far Shevus [for the following Shabbos].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Shimon ben Gamliel, who says that the baking overrides Yom Tov but not Yom Kipur, how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first Tana permits only a near Shevus; R. Shimon permits even a far Shevus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mari - Mishnah):</span> Shtei ha'Lechem are eaten on Shavu'os - this is never before the second day [from baking], and never later than the third:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Normally, they are baked on Erev Shavu'os and eaten on Yom Tov, the second day;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Erev Shavu'os is Shabbos, they are baked Erev Shabbos and eaten on Yom Tov, the third day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This is because the baking does not override Shabbos or Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If [mid'Oraisa] one may cook on Yom Tov for Shabbos, all the more so one may cook on Yom Tov for Yom Tov itself (Tosfos - Rav Chisda should permit, even though Shtei ha'Lechem are baked primarily for the Korban, not for the sake of Simchas Yom Tov)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Lachem" (you may cook for yourselves) - not for Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel says that the baking overrides Yom Tov (this shows that "Lachem" does not forbid for Hash-m! Tosfos - Rabah holds like the first Tana, not like R. Shimon.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon holds like Aba Sha'ul, who expounds "Lachem" - not for Nochrim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THINGS NOT EXEMPTED BY HO'IL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda):</span> We do not say Ho'il!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A person can be lashed eight times for plowing one furrow - if he plows with a Hekdesh ox and donkey, where Kil'ayim was planted in a vineyard, in Shemitah, on Yom Tov; he is a Kohen and a Nazir, and he plows over Tum'as Mes.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">47b----------------------------------------47b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If we say Ho'il, he should be exempt for plowing on Yom Tov, Ho'il the dirt is fitting to cover the blood of a bird [if he will slaughter one on Yom Tov! See note in Appendix.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa bar Shmuel):</span> He plowed soft rocks (they may not be used to cover blood).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One could grind them up (then they could be used)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is forbidden to grind them on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One could grind them up in an unskilled way (this is permitted mid'Oraisa on Yom Tov)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He plowed in a rocky area.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A rocky area cannot be seeded (why is he liable for Kil'ayim, plowing on Yom Tov and Shemitah?)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is rocky on top and there is loose dirt underneath.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the loose dirt could be used to cover (Question a:2 returns)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> He plowed in mud (it cannot be used for covering, for it sticks together).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Mud cannot be seeded!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The ground is wet (it can be seeded, but it does not crush into dirt, so it is invalid for covering).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> One who cooks Gid ha'Nasheh in milk on Yom Tov and eats it is lashed five times - for cooking a Gid [ha'Nasheh, which may not be eaten] on Yom Tov, for eating a Gid, for cooking meat and milk, for eating meat and milk, and for burning on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If we say Ho'il, he should be exempt for burning on Yom Tov, Ho'il it is fitting for a need [cooking permitted food]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The text of the Mishnah is mistaken - it should omit burning on Yom Tov - rather, the Gid was of a Neveilah, he is lashed for eating Neveilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Chiya's Beraisa):</span> He is lashed twice for eating and three times for cooking.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, it should omit burning, and it should say that the wood was Muktzeh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is Muktzeh mid'Oraisa?! (Why is he lashed for it?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Yes! It says "V'Hayah ba'Yom ha'Shishi v'Hechinu Asher Yavi'u" (one must prepare what he will use on Shabbos);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Lav against using Muktzeh is "Lo Sa'aseh Chol Melachah."</p></div>
