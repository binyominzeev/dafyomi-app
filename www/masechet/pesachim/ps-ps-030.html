<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHEN ARE MIXTURES OF CHAMETZ FORBIDDEN? (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah is, in its time, Chametz forbids b'Mashehu, whether b'Mino or Lo b'Mino - this is like Rav;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Not in its time it is permitted even b'Mino - this is like R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rava said that R. Shimon fines [Chametz after Pesach] because one transgressed Bal Yera'eh and Bal Yimatzei!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He fines intact Chametz, not a mixture.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This is like Rava taught elsewhere:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> When we were in Rav Nachman's academy, after Pesach he would tell us to buy Chametz (Beis Yosef, cited in Gilyon ha'Shas - dough or Se'or) of Nochrim [even though it was made during Pesach - this is like R. Shimon.]</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHAT MAY BE KASHERED FOR PESACH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Pots may not be Kashered for use on Pesach; they must be broken.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should allow to leave them to be used after Pesach Lo b'Mino [even if Mashehu absorptions of Chametz will enter the food, Rav permits this]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He decrees lest one will use them b'Mino.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> They need not be broken - one leaves them until after Pesach, then they may be used even for b'Mino.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This is like Shmuel taught elsewhere:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Shmuel (to pot sellers):</span> Do not raise your prices [after Pesach] - if you do, I will expound that the Halachah follows R. Shimon [that one may keep pots to use them after Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> [In any case] Shmuel should expound that the Halachah follows R. Shimon, since he holds like R. Shimon!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was Rav's region.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>An oven was smeared with lard; Rabah bar Ahilai forbade all bread that will ever be baked in it, even to eat it with salt, lest it be eaten with Kutach (a common dairy dip).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> We may not knead a dough with milk; if this was done, all the bread is forbidden, lest it be eaten with meat;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Similarly, we may not smear an oven with fat of the tail [and bake bread]; if this was done, all the bread is forbidden, unless the oven was Husak (heated up - this gets rid of the fat) before this.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">30b----------------------------------------30b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If the oven was Husak, the bread is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Rabah is refuted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Since Rabah was refuted, this should also refute Rav, who says that pots [may not be Kashered for Pesach, they] must be broken!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> Rav establishes the Beraisa to discuss a metal oven (Hesek Kashers it, but Cheres (earthenware) cannot. R. David - we do not give this answer for Rabah - it was known that he forbids even a metal oven, lest one will bake without heating it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Also the Beraisa discusses an oven of Cheres - it can be Kashered, for it is Husak from the inside [where the lard is];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav requires breaking pots on Pesach, for they cannot be Kashered by Hesek from the outside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should permit Kashering pots through Hesek from the inside!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are concerned that the owner will not heat them enough, lest they break.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Corollary:</span> Therefore, Buchya [a Keli made of tiles; bread is baked or fried in it] cannot be Kashered [if it was smeared with lard,] for it is normally heated from the outside (opposite the lard);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one fills it with coals, this will [heat it from the inside and properly] Kasher it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> What do we do with knives on Pesach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> I make new ones.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> You can afford to - if someone cannot afford to, what can he do?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> I meant, I make my knives like new - I cover the [wooden] handles in mud [so they will not burn during Koshering] and put the blade in fire, then I put the handles [without the mud] in boiling water.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p>The Halachah is, it suffices for the blade and handle to be in boiling water in a Keli Rishon.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHAT MAY BE KASHERED FOR PESACH? (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> A wooden mixing spoon may be Kashered in boiling water in a Keli Rishon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>He holds that k'Bol'o Kach Polto (just like it absorbs, it emits).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May Kunya (Klei Cheres plated with lead) be used on Pesach [if they had been used with Chametz]?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they are green, they absorb, surely they are forbidden; the question is only if they are white or black;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If they have cracks, they absorb, they are forbidden; the question is only if they are smooth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> We see that the outer walls give off moisture - this shows that they absorb, hence they are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">[Question:</span> Why can't they be Kashered?]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah teaches that absorptions never leave the walls of Klei Cheres ("U'Chli Cheres Asher Tevushal Bo Yishaver").</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the law of Kunya different for Chametz than for Yayin Nesech (wine used for idolatry)? Regarding Yayin Nesech, Mereimar permits, whether they are black, white or green!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We are more stringent regarding Chametz, for it is a mid'Oraisa prohibition, but Yayin Nesech is mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We pattern Rabbinic decrees like mid'Oraisa laws!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> Chametz is absorbed hot; wine is absorbed cold.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava bar Aba):</span> Any Keli used for cold Chametz may be used for Matzah, except for Beis Se'or (a Keli in which Se'or is soaked), for it (Se'or) is very potent Chametz (it is absorbed even though it is cold);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Beis Charoses (a Keli in which Chametz is kept with sharp foods) is like Beis Se'or;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Since dough is constantly kneaded in troughs of Mechuza (Rava's city), and is often left there, they are like Beis Se'or.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since they are wide and get much exposure to the air, one might have thought that they do not absorb - Rava teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHO OWNS MESHUBAD PROPERTY?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Nochri lent [money] to a Yisrael [relying] 'on' the Yisrael's Chametz (it was collateral), it is permitted after Pesach;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If a Yisrael lent to a Nochri 'on' the Nochri's Chametz (it was collateral), it is Asur b'Hana'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Abaye):</span> When a creditor collects [Meshubad property, i.e. he had a lien on it], this is retroactive [as if he collected from the time of the loan];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> He collects from now (not retroactively).</p></div>
