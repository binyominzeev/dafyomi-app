<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>HOW DOES ONE PAY FOR TERUMAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is payment according to the volume of what he ate or its value?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If it was originally worth four [Zuz when he ate it] and now [the same volume] is worth one, surely he pays four - he is no less liable than a thief;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All thieves pay the value at the time of the theft.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The question is when it was originally worth one and now it is worth four:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps he pays according to the volume, just like he ate;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, since he only ate the value of one Zuz, he need not pay more!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> If a Zar ate dry figs [of Terumah, b'Shogeg] and paid with dates, he will be blessed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We understand this if he pays according to volume - he is blessed for choosing to give dates because they are worth four times as much!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But if he pays according to the value, why is he blessed? [In any case] he pays the value of what he ate!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, he pays according to the value - he is blessed because he paid with something that people are more eager to buy than what he ate.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> If a Zar ate Chametz of Terumah on Pesach b'Shogeg, he pays Keren v'Chomesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We understand this if he pays according to volume - but if he pays according to the value, Chametz during Pesach is worthless (it is Asur b'Hana'ah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Yosi ha'Gelili, who permits benefit from Chametz b'Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If he ate b'Mezid he is exempt from payment, even from its fuel value.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Mishnah is R. Yosi ha'Gelili, why is he exempt - it has value!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana holds like R. Nechunya ben Hakanah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nechunya ben Hakanah):</span> One is exempt from paying [for damage done while performing Melachah] on Yom Kipur, just like he is exempt on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Tana'im argue about this:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Akiva):</span> If a Zar ate Chametz of Terumah on Pesach [whether Shogeg or Mezid] he is exempt from payment, even from its fuel value [because one pays according to the value];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yochanan ben Nuri obligates [because one pays according to the volume].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> What benefit can one get from it?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Nuri:</span> One cannot benefit from Tamei Terumah at any time, nevertheless one pays for eating it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Tamei Terumah is different - even though one may not eat it, one may benefit from burning it - but Chametz b'Pesach is Asur b'Hana'ah - it is like Tamei Terumah of strawberries and grapes, which may not be eaten and do not burn! (Rashi - it may not be used for Ziluf, on account of Takalah; see Matzpas Eisan.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>This applies to one who separated Terumah and then it became Chametz [or separated Chametz to be Terumah before Pesach] - but all agree that on Pesach, if one separated Chametz to be Terumah, it does not take effect.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 -R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> "V'Nosan la'Kohen Es ha'Kodesh" - something fitting to be Kodesh - this excludes one who ate Chametz of Terumah on Pesach [since if he would pay what he ate, it could not become Terumah], he is exempt from payment, even from its fuel value;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>R. Eliezer Chisma obligates.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>R. Eliezer ben Yakov. What benefit can one get from it?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer Chisma:</span> One cannot benefit from Tamei Terumah at any time, nevertheless one pays for eating it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer ben Yakov:</span> Tamei Terumah is different - even though one may not eat it, one may benefit from burning it - but Chametz b'Pesach is Asur b'Hana'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer Chisma:</span> One may also benefit from Chametz - he can feed it to his dog, or use it for fuel (it is Mutar b'Hana'ah)!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">32b----------------------------------------32b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> R. Eliezer ben Yakov, R. Akiva and R. Yochanan ben Nuri all forbid Hana'ah from Chametz b'Pesach - they argue about the following:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva holds that one pays according to value; R. Yochanan ben Nuri holds that one pays according to volume.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that R. Yochanan ben Nuri also holds that one pays according to value, and he is Mechayev because he permits Hana'ah like R. Yosi ha'Gelili - Abaye teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is so!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, he would have answered R. Akiva the way R. Eliezer Chisma answered R. Eliezer ben Yakov (one may also benefit from Chametz...)!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE SHI'UR TO BE LIABLE FOR TERUMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Zar ate a k'Zayis of Terumah [b'Shogeg], he pays Keren v'Chomesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Aba Sha'ul says, he pays only if he ate the value of a Perutah (see note in Appendix).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason for the first Tana?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "V'Ish Ki <i>Yochal</i> Kodesh bi'Shgagah" - the Shi'ur of 'Achilah' (eating) is a k'Zayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Aba Sha'ul's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "V'Nosan [la'Kohen Es ha'Kodesh]" - the Shi'ur of 'Nesinah' (giving) is a Perutah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't Aba Sha'ul learn from Yochal that it also must be a k'Zayis?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He expounds "Yochal" to exclude one who damages.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't the first Tana learn from "V'Nosan" that it also must be worth a Perutah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He expounds it to require something fitting to be Kodesh (this excludes Chametz during Pesach).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Zar ate less than a k'Zayis of Terumah [b'Shogeg], he pays Keren but not Chomesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is worth less than a Perutah, he should also be exempt from Keren;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it is worth [at least] a Perutah, he should also be liable to pay Chomesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even though it is worth a Perutah, since it is less than a k'Zayis he is exempt from Chomesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> This is unlike Aba Sha'ul - he would say that since it is worth a Perutah, even though it is less than a k'Zayis he must pay Chomesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> It is even like Aba Sha'ul - Aba Sha'ul requires both [a Perutah and a k'Zayis].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> He does not require both!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Aba Sha'ul):</span> If it is worth a Perutah, one must pay for it; if not, not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> A Perutah is the Shi'ur only for Me'ilah, but one is not liable for Terumah unless he ate a k'Zayis!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If Aba Sha'ul requires both, Chachamim should have said 'one is liable <i>since</i> he ate a k'Zayis!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>Rav Papa is refuted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>Rav Papa himself retracted [as we see from his question below]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> [Regarding Me'ilah it says] "V'Chot'ah bi'Shgagah" - this excludes Mezid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach this - a Mezid who transgressed Chayavei Kerisos is exempt [from a Korban] - all the more so Mezid should be exempt from Me'ilah, which has no Kares!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> You cannot learn from other Aveiros which have no Chiyuv Misah to Me'ilah, for which one is Chayav Misah [bi'Yedei Shomayim].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Therefore, it says "V'Chot'ah bi'Shgagah" to exclude Mezid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> At first, the Tana holds that Kares is more stringent than Misah [biYedei Shomayim] - later he holds that Misah is more stringent!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> No - the rejection is, you cannot learn from other Aveiros, which have no Chiyuv Misah for less than a k'Zayis, to Me'ilah, for which one is Chayav Misah for less than a k'Zayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak:</span> You should have serenity, for you comforted me [by answering the difficulty].</p></div>
