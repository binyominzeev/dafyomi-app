<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> They argue about whether Bnei Yisrael offered Nesachim in the Midbar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(The Torah commands to bring Nesachim upon entering Eretz Yisrael. Chachamim hold that Nesachim were already brought in the Midbar. We must say that upon entering, Nesachim will be brought (also) on private Bamos (which will become permitted), i.e. without Klei Shares. Therefore, one is liable for Ha'alas Chutz of water, even without a Kli Shares. R. Elazar holds that Nesachim were not brought in the Midbar. The Torah commands to bring Nesachim in the Mikdash in Eretz Yisrael, i.e. in Klei Shares; therefore, there is no source to obligate for water (b'Chutz) unless it was Hukdash in a Kli Shares.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ravina):</span> (All agree that Nesachim (of wine) were brought in the Midbar, and on private Bamos in Eretz Yisrael without Klei Shares. Therefore, one is liable for Ha'alas Chutz of <i>wine</i>, even without a Kli Shares.) They argue about whether we learn Nisuch ha'Mayim from Nisuch of wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who is Menasech three Lugim of water outside is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon says, this is only if they were Hukdeshu in a Kli Shares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ada bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> They argue about a heaping measure (above the rim. Chachamim say that the excess is Mekudash, and R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon says that it is not.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava brei d'Rabah):</span> They argue about whether Nesachim are offered on a Bamah, like the following Tana'im argue:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Nesachim are not needed on a private Bamah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, they are required.</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it rather teaches that they must be brought on a Bamas Yachid!</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yochanan teaches that R. Nechemyah holds like the opinion that inner Shirayim are Me'akev. The Beraisa discusses outer Shirayim.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here, 'Machshir' means that it enables one to be liable (for Ha'alas Chutz).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He argues about the first law. Chachamim obligate (for Ha'alas Chutz) when Melikah was inside, and they exempt when Melikah was outside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1A:</span> R. Shimon says, just like one is liable when Melikah was inside, also when it was outside.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, R. Shimon should not have said 'if one is liable outside (...he is liable inside)', rather, 'if one is liable inside (...he is liable outside')!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he argues about the Seifa. Chachamim exempt (for Ha'alas Chutz) when Shechitah was inside and obligate when it was outside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2A:</span> R. Shimon says, just like one is exempt when Shechitah was inside, also when it was outside.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ze'iri):</span> They argue about a Behemah slaughtered at night;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah means, if one slaughtered a Behemah at night inside and offered outside, he is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it was slaughtered at night outside and offered outside, he is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Shimon says, just like one is liable when Shechitah was outside, also when it was inside. The only exception is Ha'alas Chutz of a bird.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rava):</span> They argue about Kabalah in a Chulin Kli;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah means that similarly, if Kabalah was in a Chulin Kli in the Mikdash and the Korban was offered outside, he is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Kabalah was in a Chulin Kli b'Chutz and it was offered outside, he is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Shimon says, just like one is liable when it was done outside, also when it was inside. The only exception is Ha'alas Chutz of a bird slaughtered inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>The following suggests another answer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel's father - Beraisa):</span> If Melikah was done inside and the bird was offered outside, he is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Melikah and Ha'alah were b'Chutz, he is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Shimon obligates.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5:</span> R. Shimon discusses this case. The text should say 'whenever one is liable (for Ha'alas Chutz) for an act done inside (e.g. Melikah), he is liable if the act was done outside.' (This suggests that when one is exempt for an act inside, he is exempt outside. Therefore, R. Shimon adds 'except for Ha'alas Chutz of a bird slaughtered inside', for which he is exempt, but if it was slaughtered outside, he is liable.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p><i>HAKRAVAH</i> INSIDE AND OUTSIDE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the blood of a Chatas was received in one bucket:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If some of the blood was thrown outside and then some inside, or vice-versa, he is liable, for all of the blood is Kosher for Zerikah inside;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If the blood was received in two buckets -</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If both were thrown inside, he is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If both were thrown outside, he is liable (for each one, e.g. if he remembered in between);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If one was thrown inside and then the other outside, he is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If one was thrown outside and then the other inside, he is liable for the former, and the latter is Mechaper. (The Korban is Kosher, and he was Yotzei.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This is similar to one who was Makdish his Chatas, lost it, made another Hekdesh, and then found the first;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he slaughtered both of them inside, he is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he slaughtered both of them outside, he is liable (for each one);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he slaughtered one inside and then the other outside, he is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If he slaughtered one outside and then the other inside, he is liable for the former, and the latter is Mechaper;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>(When both were slaughtered inside,) just like Zerikah (of the first) exempts the meat of that animal (from Me'ilah), it exempts the meat of the other animal, too.</p></div>
