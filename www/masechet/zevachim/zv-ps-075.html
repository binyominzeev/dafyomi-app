<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p><i>KODSHIM</i> THAT BECAME MIXED (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> If an individual's Korban was mixed with an individual's Korban, or a Korban Tzibur was mixed with a Korban Tzibur, or an individual's Korban was mixed with a Korban Tzibur, four Matanos of blood are made from each (Rebbi Kesav Yad - four Matanos in all);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one Matanah was done from each, each Korban is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If four Matanos were done from all of them, they are Kesherim (this will be explained).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This applies when they became mixed while they were alive. If they became mixed after Shechitah, he does four Matanos from all of them. If he did one Matanah from each, each is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Rebbi says, this depends. If the Matanah is big enough to contain (a Shi'ur of) blood for each animal, it is Kosher. If not, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Presumably, the case of (a Korban of) an individual resembles that of a Tzibur, i.e. it is of men (and we offer them)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rava):</span> Surely, the text of the Beraisa is mistaken! It says 'this is if they became mixed while they were alive, but not if it was after Shechitah.' Surely, this makes no difference!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (to question and counter-question - Rava):</span> The Beraisa should say 'this is if they became mixed after Shechitah in a way similar to becoming mixed while alive, i.e. the buckets (each with the blood of one Korban) became mixed, but it the bloods became mixed together, he does four Matanos for all of them;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rebbi says, this depends. If the Matanah has enough blood for each, it is Kosher. If not, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rebbi holds that there is no Shi'ur (required amount)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> R. Eliezer holds that Haza'ah (with Mei Chatas) of any amount is Metaher. There is no Shi'ur!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">75b----------------------------------------75b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is Kosher even if half the water was Kosher and half Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rebbi explains R. Eliezer's opinion, but Rebbi disagrees.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The law of Matanos of blood is unlike that of Haza'ah of Mei Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p><i>KODSHIM</i> MIXED WITH A <i>BECHOR</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If they became mixed with Bechor or Ma'aser (Behemah)...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rami bar Chama):</span> According to Beis Shamai, a Nidah may not eat a Bechor (even with a Mum). May she eat Temuras Bechor? (One said 'this Chulin animal is (Kodesh) in place of this Bechor.')</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rami bar Chama):</span> A Bechor may not be redeemed. Can Temuras Bechor be redeemed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #3 (Rami bar Chama):</span> One may not weigh meat of a (blemished) Bechor to sell it. May one weigh Temuras Bechor?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (to all three questions - Rava - Beraisa):</span> Temurah applies to Bechor and Ma'aser (even) after they became blemished. The law of the Temurah is like their law.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> If a Kohen was Makdish a (blemished) Bechor to Bedek ha'Bayis, may we weigh the meat (to determine how much a buyer should pay to redeem it)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since Hekdesh benefits from this, it is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, we are more concerned for disgrace to Kodshim, so it is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yosi bar Zvida - Mishnah):</span> If they became mixed with Bechor or Ma'aser, they are Ro'im. All are eaten like Bechor or Ma'aser;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This teaches that they may not be sold by weight (even though the redemption money would be used for substitute Korbanos)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Huna and R. Chizkiyah (Talmidim of R. Yirmeyah)):</span> We cannot learn from there. There, one may not sell an animal by weight (lest it is a Bechor) in order that we will receive more money for <i>other</i> Zevachim, which will be used for a Korban;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Here, although the money will be for (Bedek ha'Bayis,) a different Kedushah than Bechor, the very animal we disgrace will bring a profit to Hekdesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yosi bar Avin):</span> Obviously, we may not weigh the meat!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a Bechor Ba'al Mum (Tosfos - from birth) was Hukdash to Bedek ha'Bayis, would we allow one to redeem it (to allow him to work with it and shear it) in order that Hekdesh will receive more money?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is not comparable. Such a redemption is forbidden mid'Oraisa, but weighing the meat is only mid'Rabanan! (Rashi; Tosfos - both are forbidden mid'Oraisa. Shitah Mekubetzes - the Torah explicitly forbids redemption. Weighing is forbidden mid'Oraisa only due to Svara (reasoning). Perhaps the Svara that Hekdesh should receive more money is stronger!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Ami):</span> The Kohen who received the Bechor did not receive full ownership. He did not have the right to sell it by weight. He cannot give to Hekdesh more ownership than he had!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHICH <i>KODSHIM</i> CAN BECOME MIXED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It is possible for any two kinds of Zevachim to become mixed together, except for Chatas and Asham.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> They cannot become mixed, because Asham is always a male, and Chatas is always a female. Also Olah is always a male, also it cannot become mixed with Chatas!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chatas of a Nasi is a male goat. It can become mixed with Olah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Nasi's goat is distinguishable from an Asham, which is always a sheep, which has wool.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Korban Pesach must be a yearling (goat or sheep). It cannot become mixed with Asham, a second year animal!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Asham Nazir and Asham Metzora are Kesherim in the first year.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Sometimes an animal in (i.e. towards the end of) its first year cannot be distinguished from an animal in (the beginning of) its second year.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>CAUSING <i>KODSHIM</i> TO BE WASTED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> If an Asham became mixed with a Shelamim, both are slaughtered in the north, and both are eaten with all the stringencies (of Asham, i.e. it is eaten for only one day, only by male Kohanim in the Azarah);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chachamim say, we do not cause Kodshim to be (possibly) wasted. (If we limit the time (Rashi - or place) or people permitted to eat it (more stringently than the Torah did), perhaps it will not be eaten in time, and some will become Nosar! Rather, we wait for the animals to become blemished, redeem them, and use the money to buy another Asham and Shelamim. The Shelamim may be eaten for two days, by all Yisraelim, anywhere in Yerushalayim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If pieces of Kodshei Kodoshim became mixed with pieces of Kodshim Kalim, or if Kodshim (even Kalim) that may be eaten only one day became mixed with Kodshim permitted for two days and the night in between, they are eaten like the most stringent Kodshim of the mixture.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - a reciter of Beraisos):</span> One may not buy Terumah with Demei (money paid for produce of) Shemitah, for this limits the time to eat it. (E.g. if one sold Shemitah apples and bought wheat with the money, (also) the wheat gets Kedushas Shemitah. When apples are no longer available to Chayos in the field, one may keep three meals worth of (apples and) wheat in his house. He must do Bi'ur with the rest, i.e. eradicate it (from the world, or from his possession).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion (Rabanan):</span> This is unlike R. Shimon, who permits causing Kodshim (or Terumah) to become Pesulim (forbidden to eat)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> No, even R. Shimon could agree to this. He permits only b'Di'eved (if Kodshim already became mixed; Shitah Mekubetzes' text explicitly says this), but not to cause this l'Chatchilah.</p></div>
