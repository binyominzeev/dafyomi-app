<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHAT MAKES <i>PIGUL</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa against Rava):</span> What do you learn from 'Shelishi' in the short verse?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> This teaches that improper intent takes effect only if it is in a place Meshulash with blood, meat and Eimurim (Rashi - all are offered or consumed there; R. Yom Tov - a place is Meshulash if all of these become Pasul there).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already know this from Shelishi in the long verse (which comes first)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Masnah):</span> From there, one might have thought that "Shelishi" is a Perat (specific term) and "Pigul" is a Klal (general term), and from a Perat u'Chlal we include everything (all places);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Therefore, it must say Shelishi in the short verse to teach that the place must be Meshulash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> "V'Im He'achel Ye'achel mi'Bsar Zevach Shelamav" discusses one who plans to eat on the third day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it discusses one who eats on the third day!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If it was already Kosher (at the time of Zerikah), it cannot become Pasul later!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> We find that a Zav (or Zavah or Shomeres Yom k'Neged Yom) who is Muchzak to be Tahor, if he (or she) sees an emission (or blood), (s)he retroactively becomes Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Similarly, a Korban that was Kosher can become Pasul later!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> "Ha'Makriv" - it becomes Pasul at the time it is offered, and not on the third day.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "ha'Makriv" disqualifies the Kohen who offered it!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Oso"- only the Zevach becomes Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DELAYING VOWS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Ben Azai) Suggestion:</span> Since it says "Lo Se'acher Leshalmo", if one delayed bringing the Korban he vowed (and transgressed Lo Se'acher), it is Pasul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Oso" - Pigul is not Meratzeh, but a late Korban is accepted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Others say, "Lo Yechashev" teaches that it becomes Pasul through intent, but not (through being eaten) on the third day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Ben Azai's source that the Korban becomes Pasul, but the Kohen does not?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He agrees with 'Others'. (The Torah needed to teach that eating on the third day does not disqualify. One would never think that this could disqualify the Kohen who offered it! Rather, it must refer to the Korban.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "Lo Yeratzeh" refers to the Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ben Azai should learn that a late Korban is acceptable like Others! (Why does he need "Oso"?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Others) Suggestion:</span> A Bechor (a firstborn male Kosher animal, which is automatically a Korban) that was not offered in its first year should be Pasul like a blemished Korban!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">29b----------------------------------------29b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Achalta... Ma'aser Degancha... u'Vchoros Bekarcha" equates Bechor and Ma'aser (of produce). Just like Ma'aser is not disqualified if it is not eaten within the year, also Bechor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that Bechor is not disqualified because it does not atone for anything, but one who must bring a Korban is not Yotzei if he brought it late;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Oso" teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should learn from the following verse!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"V'Hayah <i>Becha</i> Chet" - (if you delay fulfilling your vow, there is sin in you, but) there is no sin in your Korban (it is Kosher).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ben Azai expounds "v'Hayah <i>Becha</i> Chet", but there is no sin in your wife (she will not die for this).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> A woman dies if her husband does not pay the theft (Rashi; Tosfos - <i>never</i> brings the vows) that he owes - "Im Ein Lecha Leshalem Lamah Yikach Mishkavcha mi'Tachtecha";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One might have thought that she dies also if he delays offering vows. Ben Azai teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Others):</span> "Lo Yechashev" - it becomes Pasul through intent, but not on the third day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Eliezer expound "Lo Yechashev"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He expounds like R. Yanai;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Yanai):</span> An intent (of Chutz li'Mkomo) that accompanies an intent (of Chutz li'Zmano) prevents Kares - "Lo Yechashev", different intents will not be mixed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rav Mari - (R. Yanai):</span> One who offers Kodshim with improper intent is lashed - "Lo Yechashev".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> One is not lashed for a Lav without an action!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mari):</span> He holds like R. Yehudah, who says that one is lashed for such a Lav.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DIFFERENT INTENTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The general rule about Shechitah, Kabalah, Holachah or Zerikah done with (improper) intent to eat something that is normally eaten, or Lehaktir (to burn on the Mizbe'ach) something that is normally burned there:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he intended for a k'Zayis (e.g. of meat) Chutz li'Mkomo, the Korban is Pasul, and there is no Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he intended for a k'Zayis Chutz li'Zmano, the Korban is Pigul, and one who eats it is Chayav Kares, if the Matir (the blood, which permits the meat and Eimurim) was offered properly (except for intents of Chutz li'Zmano).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When do we say that the Matir was offered properly?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He slaughtered properly, and did Kabalah, Holachah or Zerikah (with intent) Chutz li'Zmano;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Or, he slaughtered Chutz li'Zmano, and did the other three Avodos properly;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, he did all four Avodos Chutz li'Zmano.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When do we say that the Matir was not offered properly?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He slaughtered Chutz li'Mkomo, and did Kabalah, Holachah or Zerikah Chutz li'Zmano;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Or, he slaughtered Chutz li'Zmano, and did one of the other three Avodos Chutz li'Mkomo;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, he did all four Avodos Chutz li'Mkomo;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Or, regarding a Chatas or Pesach, he slaughtered Lo Lishmah (this disqualifies these Korbanos), and did Kabalah, Holachah or Zerikah Chutz li'Zmano;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Or, he slaughtered Chutz li'Zmano, and did one of the other three Avodos Lo Lishmah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Or, he did all four Avodos Lo Lishmah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If he intended to eat a k'Zayis Chutz li'Mkomo, and (later intended to eat) a k'Zayis Chutz li'Zmano, or vice-versa, or half a k'Zayis Chutz li'Mkomo, and half a k'Zayis Chutz li'Zmano, or vice-versa, it is Pasul, and there is no Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, the general rule is, if intent Chutz li'Zmano came first, it is Pigul, and there is Kares. If intent Chutz li'Mkomo came first, it is Pasul, and there is no Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Chachamim say, whichever came first, it is Pasul, and there is no Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he intended to eat half a k'Zayis (Chutz li'Mkomo or Chutz li'Zmano) and Lehaktir half a k'Zayis, it is Kosher, because eating and burning do not join.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Ilfa):</span> Chachamim and R. Yehudah argue about intents in two different Avodos, but if he had both intents in one Avodah, all agree that it is Pasul, and there is no Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> They argue even about intents in one Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Ilfa, the entire Mishnah discusses (intents in) different Avodos. According to R. Yochanan, the Reisha discusses two Avodos, and the Seifa discusses one Avodah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, that is how R. Yochanan explains the Mishnah.</p></div>
