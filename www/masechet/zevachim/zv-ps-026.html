<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> If a Korban is inside the Azarah but its foot is outside:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he cut the foot off and then slaughtered, it is Kosher. If he slaughtered and then cut the foot, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he slaughtered after cutting off the foot, it is blemished!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 - Correction:</span> Rather, if he cut the foot off (after Shechitah) and then did Kabalah, it is Kosher. If he did Kabalah and then cut the foot, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Zeira taught that if one nicked the ear before Kabalah, it is Pasul. "v'Lakach... mi'Dam ha'Par" teaches the bull must be intact.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Chisda):</span> He cut only the flesh of the foot, but not the bone. (This is not a blemish.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> (If Kabalah is done before it is cut, it is Pasul.) This teaches that the blood absorbed in limbs (e.g. the leg) is considered blood (to become Pasul if it leaves the Azarah. Rashi - and also, one who eats it is Chayav Kares; Tosfos - and Me'ilah and Pigul do not apply to it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, perhaps the Pesul is because the blood absorbs fat from the leg, and this enters the Mizrak.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> (The absorption disqualifies the blood because) meat of Kodshim Kalim that leaves the Azarah before Zerikah is Pasul (even though after Zerikah, one may take the meat anywhere in Yerushalayim to eat it)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps R. Ami discusses Kodshei Kodoshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Kodshei Kodoshim must be slaughtered in the north (half of the Azarah), Kabalah of their blood must be in a Keli Shares in the north;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one was in the south and he stuck his hand into the north and slaughtered, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Kabalah was done this way, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he entered his head and the majority of his body (into the north), it is as if he is entirely there (the Kabalah is Kosher).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If the animal quivered after Shechitah and moved to the south and returned to the north, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Kodshim Kalim must be slaughtered in the Azarah. Kabalah must be in a Keli Shares in the Azarah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one was outside (the Azarah) and stuck his hand in and slaughtered, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Kabalah was done this way, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he entered his head and the majority of his body, this does not help.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If the animal quivered after Shechitah and left the Azarah and returned, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Meat of Kodshim Kalim that leaves the Azarah before Zerikah is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps it is Pasul because the tail (if it is a sheep) or the kidneys left (these are Eimurim offered on the Mizbe'ach, which may never leave the Azarah. Meat may leave after Zerikah, so perhaps it may leave even before Zerikah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Shmuel's father):</span> May one slaughter l'Chatchilah if the animal is inside the Azarah, but its feet are outside?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> "V'Hevi'um la'Shem" - it must be entirely in front of Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MUST <i>AVODAH</i> BE ON THE FLOOR?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Shmuel's father):</span> If one slaughtered it while it was hanging (in the air), what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> It is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 - Shmuel's father):</span> No, we require "Al Yerech (right near, i.e. on the floor) ha'Mizbe'ach."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Shmuel's father):</span> If one slaughtered it while <i>he</i> was hanging, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> It is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 - Shmuel's father):</span> No. The Shechitah (i.e. the animal) must be "Al Yerech ha'Mizbe'ach", but the slaughterer need not be.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Shmuel's father):</span> If one did Kabalah while he was hanging, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> It is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 - Shmuel's father):</span> No, this is not the proper way to do Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Shmuel's father):</span> If one did Kabalah while it was hanging, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> It is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 - Shmuel's father):</span> No. Shechitah must be "Al Yerech ha'Mizbe'ach", but Kabalah need not be.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Regarding Kodshei Kodoshim, each of these is Pasul, except for one who slaughtered when he was hanging;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding Kodshim Kalim, each of these is Kosher, except for one who did Kabalah while he was hanging.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> You are Machshir Kodshim Kalim that are hanging, because (hanging in) the air above the Azarah is like (resting on) the Azarah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Likewise, you should Machshir Kodshei Kodoshim that are hanging, because (hanging in) the air above the north (half of the Azarah) is like (resting in) the north!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rather, for any Korban, each of these is Kosher, except for Kodshei Kodoshim that were hanging (even though it is as if it is in the north, this is not Al Yerech) and a hanging Kohen who did Kabalah (for any Korban).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If the Kohen is in the Azarah, only his hair is outside, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> Just like "v'Hevi'um la'Shem" teaches that the animal must be entirely in front of Hash-m, "b'Vo'am El Ohel Mo'ed" teaches that the Kohen must be entirely in the Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>BLOOD PUT IN THE WRONG PLACE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In the following cases, the Korban is Pasul, but there is no Kares (this will be explained):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The blood was put on the ramp, or on a part of the Mizbe'ach not above the Yesod (the Yesod was a base around two sides of the Mizbe'ach);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Blood of a Korban that must be put on top (on the corners of the Mizbeach) was put on the bottom, or vice-versa;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Blood of a Korban that must be put on the inner Mizbe'ach was put on the outer Mizbe'ach, or vice-versa.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">26b----------------------------------------26b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Shmuel):</span> The meat is Pasul (forbidden), but the owner was Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Va'Ani Nesativ Lachem Al ha'Mizbe'ach Lechaper" - once blood reaches the Mizbe'ach, there is Kaparah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the meat should be permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Lechaper" - the rest of the Mizbe'ach is Kosher for Kaparah, but not for other things.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Shmuel holds that (putting blood in) the wrong place is like (putting it in) the right place.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah #1):</span> In the following cases, if Dam ha'Nefesh remains, a Kosher Kohen should receive it (to do a proper Zerikah):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The blood was put on the ramp, or on a part of the Mizbe'ach not above the Yesod;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Blood that must be put on top was put on bottom, or vice-versa;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Blood that must be put on the inner Mizbe'ach was put on the outer Mizbe'ach, or vice-versa.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If (putting in) the wrong place is like the right place, why is another Zerikah needed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We do a proper Zerikah to permit eating the meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Since the Korban already atoned, another Zerikah does not permit the meat!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Korban did not atone. The case is, a Pasul Kohen did the first Zerikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the Korban was Nidcheh (permanently disqualified)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah #2):</span> If Kabalah was done (with intent to eat or do Zerikah) Chutz li'Zmano or Chutz li'Mkomo, if Dam ha'Nefesh remains, a Kosher Kohen should do a proper Kabalah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> An improper Kabalah can be fixed, but an improper Zerikah cannot.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> An improper Zerikah cannot be fixed due to Dichuy!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No. (It was not Nidcheh.) The Zerikah cannot be fixed because it was done with improper intent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> If so, also an improper Kabalah cannot be fixed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Improper intent of someone Pasul to serve does not disqualify!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Intent disqualifies only if the person is Kosher to serve, on something Kosher for the Avodah, and in a place Kosher for the Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> No, also an improper Zerikah can be fixed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The correct inference from Mishnah #2 is that an improper Kabalah can be fixed, but an improper Shechitah cannot.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches that intent disqualifies. A Mishnah teaches this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (Because Pesulim may slaughter,) they disqualify through improper intent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is that they do not disqualify Kabalah (or later Avodos), like Rava taught (because Kesherim are required).</p></div>
