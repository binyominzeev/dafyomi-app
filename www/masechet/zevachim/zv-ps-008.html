<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Shachat Osah l'Chatas" - the Shechitah must be l'Shem Chatas.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches that Shinuy Kodesh and Ba'alim are forbidden. What is the source that they disqualify a Chatas?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1- part 1:</span> We learn as Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua learned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> "Chatas<i>o</i> (his Chatas)" - it must be l'Shem ha'Ba'alim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We have learned that Shinuy Kodesh is forbidden l'Chatchilah, and Shinuy Ba'alim in Zerikah disqualifies a Chatas;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>What is the source that Shinuy Kodesh disqualifies in all Avodos, and that Shinuy Ba'alim is forbidden and disqualifies in the Avodos other than Zerikah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 - part 2 (R. Yonah):</span> We learn from the Chatas of a Nazir. "...V'Asah Es Chataso v'Es Olaso" - all the Asiyos (of the Chatas) must be l'Shem Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about Shinuy Kodesh. What is the source for Shinuy Ba'alim?</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Ravina):</span> If we expound this way, what will we learn from "Olas<i>o</i>"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ravina did not ask about "Minchas<i>o</i>" and "Nisch<i>o</i>" - what does he expound from them?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns that Menachos and Nesachim may be brought the night after offering the Korban they accompany, or the next day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> We cannot learn from the Chatas of a Nazir to a Chatas for eating Chelev (i.e. a normal Chatas for a Shogeg (unintentional) transgression (which if Mezid would be punishable with Kares) or vice-versa!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We cannot learn Chatas Chelev from Chatas Nazir, since other Korbanos accompany Chatas Nazir;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We cannot learn Chatas Nazir from Chatas Chelev, since the latter atones for a transgression of Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (a)) - part 1 (Rava):</span> We learn from the Chatas of a Metzora. "V'Asah ha'Kohen Es ha'Chatas" - all the Asiyos must be l'Shem Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about Shinuy Kodesh. What is the source for Shinuy Ba'alim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 - part 2:</span> "V'Chiper Al ha'Mitaher" - on this person who is becoming Tahor, but not on another.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from Chatas Metzora to Chatas Chelev, or vice-versa!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We cannot learn Chatas Chelev from Chatas Metzora, since other Korbanos accompany Chatas Metzora;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We cannot learn from one of these to another. Perhaps we can learn one of them from the other two!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which one could we learn?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We could learn Chatas Chelev from the others.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn it from Chatas Nazir and Chatas Metzora, since other Korbanos accompany them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We could learn Chatas Nazir from the others.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn it from the others, for one can exempt himself from it through annulling his vow (to be a Nazir). Chatas Chelev and Chatas Metzora do not have this leniency.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> We could learn Chatas Metzora from the others.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn it from the others, since a poor person can bring a bird for it. Chatas Nazir and Chatas Chelev must always be animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, we learn from "Zos ha'Torah... (vela'Chatas... ul'Zevach ha'Shelamim)" - Chatas is equated to Shelamim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like Shinuy Kodesh and Shinuy Ba'alim are forbidden regarding Shelamim, also regarding Chatas;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The other verses (brought above) disqualify Lo Lishmah regarding Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches only about Chatas Chelev, about which it says "l'Chatas";</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>What is the source for Chata'os brought for idolatry, false oaths of not knowing testimony or of Bituy, or a Tamei person who entered the Mikdash or ate Kodshim? (It does not say l'Chatas in these Parshiyos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn a Chatas for idolatry from Chatas Chelev, since both are Chayavei Kerisus;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learn the others from a Tzad ha'Shavah of Chatas Chelev, Chatas Metzora and Chatas Nazir.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A PESACH OFFERED AT THE WRONG TIME</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Korban Pesach was slaughtered at the proper time (on Erev Pesach) Lishmah it is (fully) Kosher. If it was slaughtered Lo Lishmah it is (fully) Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was slaughtered at any other time (Tosfos - before the first Pesach after it was Hukdash), Lishmah it is Pasul, and Lo Lishmah it is Kosher (but he was not Yotzei).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this (latter law)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel's father):</span> "V'Im Min ha'Tzon Korbano l'Zevach Shelamim" - a Korban that is brought from Tzon (sheep or goats, i.e. a Pesach) is (at any other time) a Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is only if it is slaughtered l'Shem Shelamim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Ila):</span> "L'Zevach" includes (if it was slaughtered l'Shem) any Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps if it was slaughtered l'Shem any Korban, it becomes that Korban!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Had the Torah said 'l'Shelamim v'Zevach', that would be correct!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, it says "l'Zevach Shelamim" to teach that if it is slaughtered l'Shem any Korban, it is a Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should say that "l'Zevach" is a Klal, and "Shelamim" is a Prat, and from a Klal u'Frat we only learn the Prat, i.e. Shelamim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "La'Shem" is a closing Klal (so we expound Klal u'Frat u'Chlal).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yakov of Nehar Pekod):</span> The opening and closing Klalim are dissimilar! The opening Klal (l'Zevach) includes only animals, and the closing Klal (la'Shem) teaches all Korbanos to Hash-m, even birds and flour-offerings!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana is Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael, who expounds such a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>From a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal we learn everything similar to the Prat (Shelamim). If it was slaughtered l'Shem any Korban, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Prat is a Korban that one brings for a vow. We should only learn such Korbanos, i.e., Olah and Shelamim, but not Chatas and Asham!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "L'Zevach" is (Rashi - an extra word, therefore it is) not a Klal, rather, a Ribuy (inclusion).</p></div>
