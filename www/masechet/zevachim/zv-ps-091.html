<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Musafim are not more Kadosh. Temidim brought on Shabbos also receive the Kedushah of Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> Musafim of Shabbos come before Musafim of Rosh Chodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even though Musfei Rosh Chodesh are more Kadosh (Rosh Chodesh is called Mo'ed, but Shabbos is not), Musfei Shabbos come first, for they are more Tadir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They are not more Kadosh. Kedushas Rosh Chodesh affects all the Musafim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Mishnah):</span> Musafim of Rosh Chodesh come before Musafim of Rosh Hashanah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even though Musfei Rosh Hashanah are more Kadosh, Musfei Rosh Chodesh come first, for they are more Tadir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They are not more Kadosh. Kedushas Rosh Hashanah affects all the Musafim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Beraisa):</span> Another reason (why Borei Peri ha'Gafen precedes the Brachah 'Mekadesh ha'Shabbos' in Kidush) is that Borei Peri ha'Gafen is more Tadir than Mekadesh ha'Shabbos. Tadir comes first.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This applies, even though Mekadesh ha'Shabbos is more Kadosh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is not more Kadosh. Borei Peri ha'Gafen also receives the Kedushah of Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5:</span> R. Yochanan taught thatif the time for Minchah came and one did not yet pray Musaf, he should first pray Minchah (it is more Tadir), and then Musaf (which is more Kadosh).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Musaf is not more Kadosh. Minchah also receives the Kedushah of Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #6 (Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> A Shelamim of yesterday comes before a Chatas or Asham of today.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If both Korbanos were of today, all would agree that Chatas or Asham is first (for it is more Kadosh), even though Shelamim is more Tadir!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Shelamim is more <i>common</i>, but it is not more Tadir (the only obligation to bring Shelamim is on the festivals. Chata'os must be brought every Rosh Chodesh and festival! The inference (if both were of today, all would agree that Shelamim is last) applies only to Chatas and Shelamim. Shelamim is more Tadir than Asham (which has no fixed time). It would precede Asham even if both were of today.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna bar Yehudah):</span> Indeed, what is more common is considered Tadir!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps there is no Chatas for (failure to bring) Korban Pesach, but Chatas is brought for (neglect of) Milah (circumcision), for this is more Tadir!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This means that it is more Tadir regarding Mitzvos. (Thirteen covenants were made over it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Compared to Pesach, Milah is Tadir. (Rashi - Pesach is only once a year, but Milah is done (within Klal Yisrael) every day. Sefas Emes - even though Milah is not <i>performed</i> constantly, a circumcised man <i>fulfills</i> it constantly.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>IF THE LESS <i>TADIR</i> OFFERING WAS SLAUGHTERED FIRST</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the less Tadir Korban was slaughtered first, what should be done?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Do we finish offering it, and then offer the Tadir Korban?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, does someone stir its blood (lest it congeal) until we finish offering the Tadir Korban, and then we finish offering the less Tadir one?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna of Sura - Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> A Shelamim of yesterday comes before a Chatas (or Asham) of today.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Assumption:</span> The case is, the Shelamim was slaughtered, and the Chatas (or Asham) is ready to be slaughtered.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If both Korbanos were of today, all would agree that if Shelamim was slaughtered first, we stir its blood and delay Zerikah until we finish offering the more Kadosh Korban (Chatas. Similarly, if a less Tadir Korban was slaughtered first, we delay Zerikah until offering the more Tadir Korban!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps R. Meir and Chachamim argue when both (yesterday's Shelamim and today's Chatas) were already slaughtered. We cannot deduce whether we would disgrace a Korban (to delay its Zerikah) until (slaughtering and) offering a more Tadir or Kodesh Korban!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> Another reason us that the Brachah on wine is more Tadir than Mekadesh ha'Shabbos, and Tadir comes first. (Even though it is already Shabbos, we delay Mekadesh ha'Shabbos until after the Brachah on wine. Similarly, we should delay the less Tadir Korban until we offer the more Tadir one!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Since the wine is ready in front of, this is like when both Korbanos are already slaughtered. (Surely, we offer the Tadir first in this case.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> R. Yochanan taught, if the time for Minchah came and one did not yet pray Musaf, he should first pray Minchah (it is more Tadir), and then Musaf (even though the time for Musaf came first)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Since it is now the time for Minchah, this is like when both Korbanos are already slaughtered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> If Korban Pesach was slaughtered before midday, it is Pasul, for it must be "Bein ha'Arba'im." If it was slaughtered before the afternoon Tamid, it is Kosher. We stir its blood (and delay Zerikah) until after Zerikah (of the Tamid).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Ravina):</span> It means, if the Tamid <i>was slaughtered</i> (after the Pesach), we offer it first, but l'Chatchilah, we should finish offering the Pesach before slaughtering the Tamid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rav Acha Sava):</span> The Mishnah says 'until after <i>Zerikah</i>'. It does not say 'until after Shechitah and Zerikah'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kohanim may eat (Kodshim) any way they want...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "l'Mashchah" - in grandeur, the way kings eat.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A <i>NEDAVAH</i> OF OIL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> One may not volunteer (a Korban of) oil. Therefore:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The only oil that is divided among Kohanim in the Azarah is the excess oil after smearing Rekikei Menachos (Matzah wafers) of a Yisrael, or the leftovers of the Log of oil a Metzora brings;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The only oil that is Niktar (burned on the Mizbe'ach) is the excess from Rekikim of a Kohen, or from the Minchah of a Mashu'ach (anointed Kohen Gadol.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Tarfon says, one may volunteer oil.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">91b----------------------------------------91b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Shmuel):</span> According to R. Tarfon, when a Yisrael brings oil, Kemitzah is taken (and Niktar), and the rest is eaten (by Kohanim. Tosfos Yom Tov (Menachos 12:5) says that oil cannot be held in the fingers, so Shmuel must mean that a Kemitzah's volume of oil is taken in a Kli. R. Gershom (Menachos 74b) says that the oil is solidified to take Kemitzah. Rashi (Kesav Yad) and Tosfos there say that one cannot take Kemitzah of wine (for it is too clear).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "<i>Korban</i> Minchah" is extra, to teach that one may volunteer oil;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Korban of oil is like a Minchah. Kemitzah is taken, and the rest is eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (R. Zeira - Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> One may not volunteer oil. Therefore, the only oil divided among Kohanim is the excess of Rekikei Yisrael or the leftovers of the Log Metzora.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Seifa):</span> One may not volunteer oil. Therefore... The only oil Niktar is the excess from Rekikei Kohen or from Minchas Mashu'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> According to the opinion that one may volunteer oil, all of it is Niktar! (Abaye assumes one who sees Haktarah of oil would see if it was only a Kemitzah, or the entire excess from Rekikei Kohen or Minchas Mashu'ach. Since according to R. Tarfon, one would not know whether or not the oil is Nedavah, it must be that a Nedavah is totally Niktar; therefore, Abaye cannot explain the Mishnah like R. Zeira below (i). However, this is unlike Shitah Mekubetzes, who deletes 'all' from the text here.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions:</span> The Reisha is difficult for Abaye, and the Seifa is difficult for R. Zeira!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> The Seifa is not difficult for R. Zeira. Indeed, according to the opinion that one may volunteer oil, also Kemitzah of oil is Niktar!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 2:</span> The Reisha is not difficult for Abaye. The inference is invalid. The Reisha was taught only for parallel structure with the Seifa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, a Seifa may be taught merely for parallel structure with the Reisha. However, would a Tana teach a Reisha just for parallel structure with the Seifa?!</p></div>
