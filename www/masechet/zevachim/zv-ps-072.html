<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHICH THINGS CAN BECOME <i>BATEL</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (A Mishnah teaches that) mixtures including Isurei ha'Na'ah are forbidden even to a person. All the more so they are Pesulim for Korbanos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah #2):</span> The following are forbidden, and any amount forbids a mixture:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Yayin Nesech (wine that was offered to idolatry), idolatry...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both Mishnayos are needed:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If we only had Mishnah #2, one might have thought that a mixture of Chulin is forbidden, but we are not stringent to forbid a mixture of Kodshim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If we only had our Mishnah, one might have thought that a mixture is forbidden only to the Mizbe'ach, for it is repulsive (to offer an animal that really was Pasul), but Isurei ha'Na'ah are Batel to allow people to benefit from them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Forbidden animals should be Batel amidst a majority of Heter!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they are not Batel because they are important.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Partial rejection:</span> We could say so only according to Reish Lakish, who says that the text in the Mishnah (below) is '<i>everything that</i> is normally counted' (even things that are only sometimes sold by number. People often sell animals by number, therefore, they are important, and they are never Batel);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>However, R. Yochanan holds that the text says '<i>what</i> is normally counted' (i.e. only what is always sold by number. People sometimes sell a herd without counting it, therefore, animals are not important, and they can be Batel.) How can he answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Bundles of clover of Kilai ha'Kerem (other species planted with grape pits or near vines) must be burned;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">72b----------------------------------------72b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Meir says, if they became mixed with other bundles (of Heter), (and those became mixed with other bundles - some delete this from the text), all must be burned;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Chachamim say, if there is at least 200 times as much Heter as Isur, the Isur is Batel, and they are permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Meir says, everything that is normally counted is Mekadesh (forbids a mixture and is never Batel);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Chachamim say, only six things are Mekadesh - nuts of Parech (a place; Aruch - they are so soft that they can be Nifrach (crushed) by hand), pomegranates of Badan, sealed barrels, stalks of spinach or cabbage, and Yevanis gourds;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>R. Akiva adds a seventh thing that is Mekadesh - loaves of a Ba'al ha'Bayis (i.e. not of a professional baker);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>Some of these could be forbidden due to Orlah, and the others can be forbidden due to Kilai ha'Kerem.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The text is 'R. Meir says, '<i>what</i> is normally counted';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The text is '<i>everything that</i> is normally counted.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Repetition of question:</span> We understand according to Reish Lakish, but how can we answer according to R. Yochanan?</p></div>
