<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHY THE <i>CHATAS</i> WAS BURNED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> (Regarding eating the Milu'im it says) "Ki Chen Tzuveisi", "Ka'asher Tziveisi", and "Ka'Asher Tzivah Hash-m":</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Ki Chen Tzuveisi" - I (Moshe) was commanded that they should be eaten in Aninus;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Ka'asher Tziveisi" - I commanded (you to eat them) at the time (after Nadav and Avihu died);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"Ka'asher Tzivah Hash-m" - I did not say this on my own.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> The goat (Chatas Rosh Chodesh) was burned due to Aninus, therefore it says "ka'Eleh" (due to what occurred to me, i.e. becoming an Onen. All three surviving Kohanim were Onenim, so they could not eat it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> Beraisa #1 is like R. Yehudah (and R. Shimon). Beraisa #2 is like R. Nechemyah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nechemyah):</span> The goat was burned due to Aninus, therefore it says "ka'Eleh";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah and R. Shimon say, it was burned because it became Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Had it been burned due to Aninus, all three (this will be explained) should have been burned. Also, they could have eaten it at night. Also, Pinchas was with them (he could have eaten it, he was not an Onen!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Both Beraisos are like R. Nechemyah. Beraisa #1 discusses Kodshei Sha'ah (of the Milu'im). Beraisa #2 discusses Kodshei Doros (that apply to all generations.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do R. Nechemyah and R. Yehudah explain the Parshah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> R. Nechemyah explains that Moshe asked 'why didn't you (plural) eat the Chatas?', and suggested possible ways that it may have become Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Moshe:</span> Perhaps the blood entered the Heichal!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Aharon:</span> "Hen Lo Huva Es Damah El ha'Kodesh Penimah."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Moshe:</span> Perhaps the meat left Chatzer ha'Mishkan!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Aharon:</span> It was "ba'Kodesh".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Moshe:</span> Perhaps your sons offered it in Aninus, which disqualified it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Aharon:</span> They did not offer it. I did! (Aninus does not disqualify a Kohen Gadol for Avodah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Moshe:</span> If so, you (plural) should have eaten it in Aninus, "Ka'asher Tziveisi"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Aharon:</span> "Va'Tikrenah Osi ka'Eleh v'Achalti Chatas ha'Yom ha'Yitav b'Einei Hash-m" - perhaps Hash-m commanded to eat only Kodshei Sha'ah in Aninus;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>A Kal va'Chomer teaches that Kodshei Doros may not be eaten in Aninus!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Ma'aser (Sheni) is more lenient than Kodshim, yet "Lo Achalti v'Oni Mimenu" (it may not be eaten in Aninus). Kodshim are more stringent, all the more so they may not be eaten in Aninus!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>"Va'Yishma Moshe va'Yitav b'Einav" - Moshe admitted his mistake. He did not say 'I did not hear' to spare himself embarrassment. Rather, he said 'I heard and I forgot.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 2:</span> R. Yehudah and R. Shimon explain, Moshe asked 'why didn't you eat the Chatas?';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(The first three questions and answers are the same as above, up to 'they did not offer it. I did.')</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Moshe:</span> Perhaps amidst your sorrow, you were not careful, and it became Tamei!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Aharon:</span> Do you suspect me of negligence? "Va'Tikrenah Osi ka'Eleh" - in spite of my loss, even if I would have lost double (i.e. all four of my sons), I would not be negligent with Kodshim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Moshe:</span> If so, you should have eaten it in Aninus, "Ka'asher Tziveisi"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Aharon:</span> Perhaps Hash-m commanded to eat only during Aninus Laylah. A Kal va'Chomer forbids eating Kodshim in Aninus during the day!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Ma'aser is more lenient than Kodshim, yet "Lo Achalti v'Oni Mimenu." Kodshim are more stringent, all the more so they may not be eaten in Aninus! (Tosfos asks that R. Yehudah holds that also Aninus of the night is mid'Oraisa. If so, the Kal va'Chomer forbids also at night!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>"Va'Yishma Moshe va'Yitav b'Einav" - Moshe admitted his mistake. He did not say 'I did not hear' to spare himself embarrassment. Rather, he said 'I heard and I forgot.'</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It became Tamei through Ones.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Chachamim (R. Yehudah and R. Shimon), we understand why Aharon said "v'Achalti Chatas <i>ha'Yom</i> ha'Yitav b'Einei Hash-m" (it was forbidden during the day and permitted at night);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, according to R. Nechemyah, whatever was forbidden by day (Kodshei Doros) was also forbidden at night!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Aharon meant 'had I eaten the obligatory Korban <i>of this day</i> (i.e. Chatas Rosh Chodesh, which is Kodshei Doros), would Hash-m be pleased?!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Rashi) Question:</span> According to R. Nechemyah, we understand why Aharon said "Hen <i>ha'Yom</i> Hikrivu" (this was an obligatory Korban of this day, i.e. Kodshei Doros, so they could not eat it);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>How do Chachamim explain this? They do not distinguish between the Korbanos! (All were forbidden during the day and permitted at night.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Question:</span> According to Chachamim, we understand "Hen ha'Yom Hikrivu" (we could not eat it until night, and it became Tamei in the interim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to R. Nechemyah, anything forbidden during the day was also forbidden at night! (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This was said incredulously. Did my sons offer it (in Aninus, which disqualifies)?! No, I offered it!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHY THE <i>CHATAS</i> WAS BURNED (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah (and R. Shimon)):</span> If it was burned due to Aninus, all three should have been burned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which three Korbanos do they refer to?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "<i>V'Es Se'ir</i> (ha'Chatas Darash Darash Moshe)" refers to the Chatas that Nachshon voluntarily offered;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"Ha'Chatas" refers to the Chatas of the eighth day of the Milu'im;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>"Darash" refers to the Chatas of Rosh Chodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps all three of them were burned!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Hinei Nisraf" (singular) - teaches that only one of them was burned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Darash Darash" connotes two investigations. What were they?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Moshe asked why one Chatas was burned, and the others were not being eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know which was burned?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Oso Nasan Lachem Lases Es Avon ha'Edah" is Chatas Rosh Chodesh (which atones for Tum'ah of the congregation).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Seemingly, this refutes R. Nechemyah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Nechemyah holds that Kodshei Sha'ah are permitted to an Onen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> (If it was burned due to Aninus...) also, they could have eaten it at night!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Seemingly, this refutes R. Nechemyah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Nechemyah holds that Aninus Laylah is mid'Oraisa. (R. Yehudah holds that this is true for all generations, but not at the time of the Milu'im.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> ...Pinchas was with them! (He could have eaten it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Seemingly, this refutes R. Nechemyah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Nechemyah holds like R. Elazar (or Rav Ashi);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Pinchas did not become a Kohen until after he killed Zimri - "v'Haysah Lo ul'Zar'o Acharav Bris Kehunas Olam."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> He did not become a Kohen until after he resolved the conflict between the Shevatim (when Bnei Gad and Bnei Reuven built their own Mizbe'ach) - "va'Yishma Pinchas ha'Kohen..." (This is the first time he himself is called a Kohen.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Rav Ashi explain "v'Haysah Lo ul'Zar'o..."?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was only a Brachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Elazar explain "va'Yishma Pinchas ha'Kohen"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That teaches that (all or most of) the future Kohanim Gedolim would descend from him.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WAS MOSHE A <i>KOHEN</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Moshe was a Kohen Gadol, he received a share of Kodshim - "me'Eil ha'Milu'im l'Moshe Hayah l'Manah."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> ...Pinchas was with them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to Rav, they should have also asked that Moshe was with them! (He could have eaten the Chatas!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps (they did not ask, because) Moshe had no time to eat, for he was always speaking with Hash-m!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Moshe went up Har Sinai early (at the start of the morning), and came down early.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "(A Ba'al Mum) mi'Kodshei ha'Kodoshim u'Min ha'Kodoshim Yochel";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must it mention both Kodshei Kodoshim and Kodshim (Kalim)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said only Kodshei Kodoshim, one might have thought that only they are permitted (to a Ba'al Mum), because they are (or were) permitted to a Zar and Kohanim;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Had it said only Kodshim Kalim, one might have thought that only they are permitted, because they are more lenient.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question - suggestion:</span> The Beraisa says that Kodshei Kodoshim are (were) permitted to a Zar. This refers to Moshe!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> No, they are permitted to a Zar if they were offered on a Bamah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like the opinion that Menachos may be offered on a Bamah. (There is no other case of Kodshei Kodoshim. All agree that Chatas and Asham are not offered on Bamos, and Olah is never eaten.)</p></div>
