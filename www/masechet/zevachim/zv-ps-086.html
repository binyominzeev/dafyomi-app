<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If only meat and blood are offered, perhaps we must remove the sinews and bones!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Hiktir ha'Kohen Es ha'Kol."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> If they are still attached, they are offered. If they separated, even on top of the Mizbe'ach, Yerdu.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana (Tosfos - of the Beraisa; Rashi - and our Mishnah), who says that if they separated, Yerdu?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is Rebbi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Hiktir ha'Kohen Es ha'Kol ha'Mizbechah" includes bones, sinews, horns and hooves, even if they separated;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does "v'Asisa Olosecha ha'Basar veha'Dam" exclude?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that we return to the Mizbe'ach partially burned meat of an Olah (that flew off), but not partially burned bones and sinews.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rebbi says, the first verse includes, and the latter excludes. We include when they (bones, sinews...) are attached, Ya'aleh. When they are detached, Yerdu.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>(Our text cites the Mishnah now. Tosfos deletes this, for the following explains the last clause of the Beraisa, when they are on the Mizbe'ach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> This is only if they came off the meat to the side further from the fire. If they separated closer to the fire, this is part of the process of being burned. (Surely, Lo Yerdu!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>(Text of Rashi, according to Shitah Mekubetzes) Question: (Does the first Tana of the Beraisa really say that we offer them) even if they separated?! (The Mishnah said Ya'alu only when they are attached!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> It means that the law 'when they are detached, Yerdu (and they are forbidden like Kodshim)' applies only if they separated after Zerikah. If they separated before Zerikah, the Zerikah permits them (like Chulin), and the Kohen may use them (for anything,) even to make a knife handle.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Rabah holds like R. Yochanan;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It says "Lo Yihyeh" regarding (skin of) an Olah (that the Kohen receives it), and regarding Asham;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Just like the bones of Asham are permitted to Kohanim (they receive and eat the meat), also bones of an Olah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The words "Lo Yihyeh" must be extra. If not, we could not learn from the Gezerah Shavah, for Asham is more lenient. Its meat is permitted to Kohanim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Confirmation:</span> Indeed, the words "Lo Yihyeh" regarding Olah are superfluous.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada bar Ahavah - Beraisa):</span> Me'ilah applies to bones of (Kodshei) Kodshim (that are eaten) before Zerikah, but not after Zerikah (they become permitted with the meat);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Me'ilah always applies to bones of an Olah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It should say 'if bones of an Olah separated before Zerikah, there is no Me'ilah. If they separated after Zerikah, Me'ilah always applies.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Rabah argues with R. Elazar;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If bones (of an Olah) separated before Zerikah, there is Me'ilah (since they will not be offered, Zerikah does not permit them). If they separated after Zerikah, one may not benefit from them (mid'Rabanan), but there is no Me'ilah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>RETURNING ARTICLES TO THE <i>MIZBE'ACH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If any of these (Pesulim, or bones, sinews...) flew off the Mizbe'ach, we do not return them;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If a coal flew off the Mizbe'ach, we do not return it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If limbs (of a Kosher Olah) flew off the Mizbe'ach before midnight, we return it, and Me'ilah applies to it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>After midnight, we do not return it, and Me'ilah does not apply.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Just like the Mizbe'ach is Mekadesh what is proper for it, also the ramp;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Just like the Mizbe'ach and ramp are Mekadesh what is proper for them, Klei Shares are Mekadesh what is proper for them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the case (of returning limbs)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If proper meat remains, we should return even after midnight;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If proper meat does not remain, we should not return even before midnight!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses Shriri (meat that became as hard as wood).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">86b----------------------------------------86b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (#1) (Rav) Contradiction:</span> It says that we are Maktir "Kol ha'Laylah", but it continues ("Kol ha'Laylah)... v'Herim (we take off the Mizbe'ach)"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We divide the night into two halves. The first half is for Haktarah, and the latter is for Haramah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Kahana - Mishnah):</span> Normally, Terumas ha'Deshen is done at Kros ha'Gever (when the rooster (or a certain man) cries out, shortly before dawn), or close to it. On Yom Kipur, it is done at midnight. On the festivals, it is done at the end of the first Ashmores (third of the night).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If mid'Oraisa, the first half is for Haktarah, we could not do Terumas ha'Deshen before midnight!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Version #1 - Rashi - Answer (to the objection - R. Yochanan) Question: Since it says "Kol ha'Laylah", we know that this is until morning. Why does it say "Ad Boker"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that the transition from Haktarah to Haramah is before morning. The Torah did not fix the time. It allows Chachamim to decide the proper time;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Version #2 - Tosfos - Answer #2 (R. Yochanan) Question: "Kol ha'Laylah" already teaches (that the Olah burns) until morning. Why does it say "Ad Boker"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>("Kol ha'Laylah" is Kosher for Haktarah (of things not yet consumed), and also for Haramah (of ashes).) "Ad ha'Boker" teaches that there is an intermediate time (for Shriri, which is mostly consumed);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Since the Torah did not specify, surely it is midnight (after which Shriri is considered consumed). (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>On a normal day, Terumas ha'Deshen is done at Kros ha'Gever;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>On Yom Kipur, it is done at midnight, to allow the Kohen Gadol time to rest (before Avodos ha'Yom. Alternatively, other Kohanim prepare the Ma'arachah (the woodpile on the Mizbe'ach) before dawn, in order that the Kohen Gadol can begin Avodos ha'Yom promptly at dawn);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>On the festivals, it is done at the end of the first Ashmores, for there is more Deshen, and the Azarah will be full of people before Kros ha'Gever.</p></div>
