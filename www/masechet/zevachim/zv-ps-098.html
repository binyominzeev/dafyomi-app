<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>KODSHEI KODOSHIM ARE EQUATED TO EACH OTHER (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>"Vela'Chatas" - are all like Chatas, whose absorptions are Mekadesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>"Vela'Asham" - are all like Asham, i.e. there is no Kedushah to (Rashi - the Eimurim of) a fetal sac or skin of a fetus;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer holds that offspring of Korbanos are not Kadosh until they are born, and we learn what is possible from what is impossible. (Asham is a male, so it cannot have a fetal sac or skin of a fetus, yet we learn to Korbanos that can (be females and) have them.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>"Vela'Milu'im" - are all like Milu'im (inaugural Korbanos of the Mishkan), i.e. Mosreihem (the leftovers, i.e. Nosar meat) are burned, but a leftover living animal is not. (There are two possible cases of a leftover living animal. Two were separated for one Korban (in case one will be lost), or a Korban was lost and another was Hukdash to replace it and then the first was found. Neither of these occurred during the Milu'im.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>"Ul'Zevach ha'Shelamim" - are all like Shelamim, which can make Pigul (intent Chutz li'Zmano in blood is Mefagel Nesachim (Rashi; Tosfos - the meat)) and (the meat can) become Pigul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 4:a, 97b - Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> We learn about food that touched Kodshim other than Chatas from Minchah, whose absorptions are Mekadesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Torah needed to teach this regarding Minchah and Chatas;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it taught only that absorptions of Minchah are Mekadesh, one might have thought that this is because it is soft, and easily absorbed, but absorptions of Chatas are not Mekadesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Had it taught only that absorptions of Chatas are Mekadesh, one might have thought that this is because absorptions of meat penetrate deeply, but absorptions of Minchah are not Mekadesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa):</span> "Vela'Chatas" - all are like Chatas, which must be brought from Chulin money, during the day, and using the right hand (for Zerikah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for Chatas?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> "V'Hikriv Aharon Es Par ha'Chatas Asher Lo" - it was his, not of the Tzibur, and not of Ma'aser money;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "B'Yom Tzavoso..." teaches that Korbanos must be brought during the day!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, we do not learn this from Chatas. It was taught for no reason.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learn the right hand from Rabah bar bar Chanah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> 'Etzba' or 'Kehunah' (by itself) always teaches that the right hand is required. (Regarding every Korban, it says 'Kohen'!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Indeed, we do not learn this from Chatas, it was taught for no reason.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Akiva holds like R. Shimon, who says that 'Etzba' by itself teaches the right hand, but 'Kehunah' by itself does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>"Vela'Asham" - the bones of all Korbanos are permitted, just like bones of Asham. (The Torah permitted all the meat (except for the Eimurim) to Kohanim, and Nosar does not apply to the bones. Alternatively, we learn from "Lo Yihyeh.")</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>BLOOD ON GARMENTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It is clear to me that if Dam Chatas splashed onto a garment and then Dam Olah, it must be laundered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If Dam Olah splashed onto a garment and then Dam Chatas, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a garment must be laundered because it touched Dam Chatas, it must be laundered;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the obligation to launder is because it absorbed Dam Chatas, it did not absorb! (It was already satiated with Dam Olah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It need not be laundered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It is clear to me that blood on a garment is a Chatzizah (and disqualifies immersion), unless the owner is a butcher. (He is used to this, and he is not insistent to clean it);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It is clear to me that Revav (a fat or wax stain) on a garment is a Chatzizah, unless the owner sells Revav;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If blood and Revav are both on a garment, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whether the owner is a butcher (and objects to Revav) or sells Revav (and objects to blood), one of these is a Chatzizah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The question is when the owner is a butcher and sells Revav:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He does not object to one stain, but he objects to two;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Or, perhaps he does not object even to two stains!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Tevul Yom Yom (one who immersed today; he will be fully Tahor at nightfall) or Mechusar Kipurim (one whose Taharah is not complete until he brings a Korban), does not receive Kodshim to eat them at night (when he will be permitted);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>An Onen may touch Kodshim, but he may not do Avodah, and he does not receive a share to eat at night.</p></div>
