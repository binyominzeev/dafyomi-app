<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHEN DOES <i>PIGUL</i> APPLY?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Shmuel - Beraisa):</span> If Shechitah or Kabalah was done (by someone Kosher) with intent to put, on the same day, blood that should be put on top on bottom, or vice-versa; it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If in a later Avodah he intended to eat the meat Chutz li'Mkomo, it is Pasul, and there is no Kares (for one who eats the meat);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he intended Chutz li'Zmano, it is Pigul, and there is Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If Shechitah or Kabalah was done with intent to put <i>the next day</i> blood in the wrong place (on top on bottom); it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If in a later Avodah he intended to eat the meat or burn the Eimurim Chutz li'Zmano or Chutz li'Mkomo, it is Pasul, and there is no Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If putting in the wrong place is like in the right place, Chutz li'Zmano should make it Pigul with Kares!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Mar Zutra):</span> Only a kind of Zerikah that can permit meat to be eaten can make Pigul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Presumably, you learn from "v'Im He'achel Ye'achel ba'Yom ha'Shelishi (Lo Yeratzeh Pigul Yihyeh" that Pigul applies only if there was no other Isur;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If so, intent Chutz li'Zmano should not even disqualify!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> R. Yehudah holds that intent not to do Zerikah the same day (even without any intent Lizrok) disqualifies.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The Mishnah disqualifies absolutely. (This is unlike Shmuel at the top of 26b.) Putting in the wrong place is like putting it in the right place;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa is Machshir when he was silent (he did not verbalize his intent; alternatively, he put blood in the wrong place without any Pasul intent);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Mishnah discusses when he said (verbalized his intent Chutz li'Zmano; alternatively, he had Pasul intent).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>We challenge Reish Lakish with the same questions asked against Shmuel (26b 3:c), and he gives the same answers (ending with Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak's answer above (d)).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> In both the Mishnah and Beraisa, he was silent;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Putting in the wrong place is not like putting in the right place;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Beraisa is Machshir when there is more Dam ha'Nefesh (for a Kosher Kohen to be Mekabel). The Mishnah disqualifies when there is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It is Pasul, and there is no Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Reish Lakish, this is a Chidush (even though he intended Chutz li'Zmano, it is Pigul only if Zerikah permitted the meat);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, R. Yochanan holds that he was silent, and a Kosher Zerikah was not done. Obviously there is no Kares!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>This is left difficult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Shmuel explain this? (Also he said that in the Mishnah he was silent!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that if he intended Chutz li'Zmano, it is Pasul, and there is no Kares.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>CAN WE GATHER BLOOD THAT WAS THROWN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yochanan, if putting in the wrong place is not like putting in the right place, it should be as if the blood spilled on the floor. He should be able to gather it and put in the proper place!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like the opinion that one may not gather it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> All agree that if blood that should be put on top was put on top (or on bottom was put on bottom) improperly (with bad intent), we do not gather it to put it again;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They argue when it was put in the wrong place. R. Yosi says, we do not gather it. R. Shimon says, we gather it (some texts switch the opinions).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">27b----------------------------------------27b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Our Mishnah is like R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> All agree that if blood was put on top instead of on bottom, we do not gather it to put it again, and all the more so if it was put on bottom instead of on top (for it would have dripped down to the bottom anyway);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue when blood was put on the outer Mizbe'ach instead of the inner Mizbe'ach (or vice-versa - Tzon Kodoshim deletes this from the text). R. Yosi says, we gather it. R. Shimon says, we do not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rav Nachman - Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Zos Hi ha'Olah" are three exclusions. They teach three cases in which limbs of an Olah which were brought up the ramp go down: it was slaughtered at night, the blood spilled, or the blood left the Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon says "Olah" connotes only a Kosher Olah (its limbs stay on the Mizbe'ach. They are not taken down);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to include (offering the limbs or Eimurim in) the following cases?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>A Korban was slaughtered at night; the blood spilled; the blood left the Azarah; it (the meat) was left overnight; it left the Azarah; it was slaughtered with intent Chutz li'Zmano or Chutz li'Mkomo; Pesulim received and threw the blood; blood was put on top instead of on bottom or vice-versa; blood was put on the outer Mitzvah instead of the inner Mizbe'ach or vice-versa; a Pesach or Chatas that was slaughtered Lo Lishmah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Toras ha'Olah" - the Torah gave one law for everything that is Olah (goes up) on the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we include an animal that had relations with a man or woman, Muktzeh (designated for idolatry), Ne'evad (one that was served), the wages of a harlot, an animal traded for a dog, a crossbreed, a Treifah, and a Yotzei Dofen (an animal born through Caesarian section)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Rejection "Zos" excludes these.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we include the former and exclude the latter, and not vice-versa?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Each of the former was properly made Hekdesh, and the Pesul is Kodesh (Rashi - after it came to the Mikdash; Shitah Mekubetzes - it is Kosher for other Kodshim)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Each of the latter was not Pesulo Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Culmination of support:</span> R. Shimon said that if the blood was put on top instead of on bottom or vice-versa, the Korban is not taken down, and R. Yehudah did not argue.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Because the Mizbe'ach received the blood, this is (partially) Machshir the Korban. Therefore, we would not gather the blood to do Zerikah again.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The inner Mizbe'ach is Mekadesh Pesulim (Pasul Korbanos. If they were put on it, we do not take them down.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learn this from our Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Blood that should be put on the inner Mizbe'ach...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that that applies only to blood, which (for certain Korbanos) is put on the inner Mizbe'ach, but it does not Mekadesh a Kometz, for this is never put there;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Elazar teaches that it is Mekadesh even a Kometz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If foreign Ketores (i.e. other than what the Torah commands) was put on the Mizbe'ach, we take it down. Only the outer Mizbe'ach is Mekadesh Pesulim (of kinds of Korbanos) that are proper for it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The outer Mizbe'ach is Mekadesh, but the inner Mizbe'ach is not!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We explain the Beraisa as follows. If foreign Ketores was put on the outer Mizbe'ach, we take it down, for the outer Mizbe'ach is Mekadesh only Pesulim of things that are proper for it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The inner Mizbe'ach is Mekadesh Pesulim, even if they are not proper for it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Kedushah of the outer Mizbe'ach is like the ground (it was not anointed). The Kedushah of the inner Mizbe'ach is like Klei Shares (it was anointed).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHAT MAKES <i>PIGUL</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one slaughtered a Korban with one of the following intents, it is Pasul, and there is no Kares:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He intended to throw the blood or part of it Chutz li'Mkomo (outside the Azarah),</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He intended to burn the Emurim or part of them Chutz li'Mkomo;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He intended to eat Chutz li'Mkomo (for Kodshim Kalim, outside Yerushalayim; for Kodshei Kodoshim, outside the Azarah) the meat, or a k'Zayis of the meat or skin of the tail.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he slaughtered with one of the following intents, it is Pigul, and one who eats the meat is Chayav Kares:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He intended to throw the blood or part of it the following day;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He intended to burn the Emurim or part of them the following day;</p></div>
