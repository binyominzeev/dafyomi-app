<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p><i>DAM KODSHIM </i>THAT BECAME MIXED WITH OTHER BLOOD (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of Mishnah):</span> If blood that requires one Matanah (Zerikah) was mixed with blood that requires one Matanah; we do one Matanah. If blood that requires four Matanos was mixed with blood that requires four, four are done;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If blood that requires four Matanos (really, two Matanos on opposite edges; the blood goes on all four walls) was mixed with blood that requires one, R. Eliezer says that we do four Matanos;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yehoshua says, we do one Matanah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> You transgress Bal Tigra (do not do less than the Mitzvah requires)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> You transgress Bal Tosif (do not do more than the Mitzvah specifies)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> No, Bal Tosif is only when all the blood is thrown more than it should. Here, some of the blood requires all four Matanos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Likewise, Bal Tigra is only when all the blood is thrown less than it should be. Here, he has thrown some of it as much as he should!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Further, when you throw too much, you transgress Bal Tosif through an action. This is worse than throwing too little. Then, you transgress Bal Tigra passively!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Elazar):</span> R. Eliezer permits only throwing two at a time (since one of them is surely Kosher, we assume that the other is also), but not one at a time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah - Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> Even if all of them except for one were offered, the remaining one is poured into the Amah. (This implies that R. Eliezer argues, and permits throwing the last one!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah bar Tachlifa):</span> They mean, even if all of them except for one <i>pair</i> were offered, the remaining pair is poured into the Amah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>The argument of R. Eliezer and Chachamim needed to be taught regarding limbs and blood;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had the argument been taught only regarding limbs, one might have thought that there R. Eliezer permits offering the rest, for the Korban was already Mechaper (Zerikah was proper), but he would not allow Zerikah here;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it been taught only about blood, one might have thought that here Chachamim forbid throwing the rest, but they would admit regarding limbs, for the Korban was already Mechaper.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DO WE RELY ON <i>BILAH</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If a small amount of water fell into a flask with Mei Chatas, for every sprinkling done from this flask (to Metaher), two Haza'os must be done (this will be explained);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chachamim disqualify (the water may not be used).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand Chachamim. (Tosfos - even if) they hold that Yeish Bilah (we assume that one liquid disperses amidst every part of the other), they hold that there is a Shi'ur (minimum required quantity) for Haza'ah, and we cannot combine Mei Chatas from different Haza'os to comprise the Shi'ur;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> However, what is R. Eliezer's reasoning?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he holds that Ein Bilah (we do not assume that one liquid disperses amidst every part of the other), it does not help to sprinkle twice (perhaps neither is Mei Chatas)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he holds that Yeish Bilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he holds that there is no Shi'ur for Haza'ah, one Haza'ah suffices!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He must hold that there is a Shi'ur for Haza'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question (c):</span> If he holds that we cannot combine Mei Chatas from different Haza'os, it does not help to do two Haza'os;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Even if he holds that the two Haza'os join, perhaps each was mostly (plain) water, there is not a Shi'ur between them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> He holds that Yeish Bilah, and there is a Shi'ur for Haza'ah (and Haza'os join). The case is, only one drop of water fell in (so two Haza'os surely contain a Shi'ur of Mei Chatas);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> He holds that Yeish Bilah, and there is no Shi'ur for Haza'ah. It is a fine to require two Haza'os, in order that he will not profit from the water that mixed with the Mei Chatas (and increased the volume. Since all future Haza'os must be doubled, he loses);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> He holds that Ein Bilah, and there is no Shi'ur for Haza'ah. The case is, only one drop of water fell in (so two Haza'os surely contain some Mei Chatas).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Reish Lakish - Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> R. Eliezer holds that there is no Shi'ur for Haza'ah, and any amount is Metaher. The drop may be half Kosher and half Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">80b----------------------------------------80b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>(The following six questions are against Rav Ashi. We amend the text of the Beraisa like it appears in the Tosefta (8:8).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If lower blood was mixed with upper blood, we throw some above, and view the lower blood like water (and throw some below). He is Yotzei (also) with the lower blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Ein Bilah, perhaps all the lower blood was thrown above and all the upper blood was thrown below!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, the majority was upper blood. He threw above more than the amount of lower blood (so surely, some of it was upper blood).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says that he is Yotzei with the lower blood! (Perhaps all the lower blood was thrown above!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This means, he is Yotzei to put Shirayim of the upper blood on the Yesod (he puts more than the amount of lower blood, surely, some is upper blood).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2 (continuation of Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If the Kohen (without asking) threw some of the blood below, he should throw some above (and then some below). He is Yotzei with the lower blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(If Ein Bilah, perhaps all the lower blood was thrown above!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Here also, the majority was upper blood, he threw above more than the amount of lower blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says that he is Yotzei with the lower blood!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refers to his obligation to put Shirayim on the Yesod.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #3 (continuation of Beraisa):</span> If the Kohen (without asking) threw some of the blood above, all agree that he should throw below. He is Yotzei with both bloods.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Here also, the majority was upper blood. He threw above more than the amount of lower blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says that he is Yotzei with both bloods!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Indeed, the Beraisa says that all agree that he should Zorek below, but) it does not say that all agree that he is Yotzei with both bloods;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This last clause is like Chachamim, who say that Yeish Bilah (but R. Eliezer argues).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #4 (Mishnah):</span> If blood that requires one Matanah was mixed with blood that requires one Matanah, we do one Matanah (Rashi; Tosfos - for each).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Ein Bilah, why is this enough? Perhaps all the blood is from one of them! (Tosfos - the Kohen will not throw all the blood.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It means, <i>the Shi'ur for</i> one Matanah was mixed with the Shi'ur for one Matanah (Rashi - and one Matanah is thrown <i>on behalf of each Korban</i>; Tosfos - therefore, he will throw all the blood.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We similarly explain the next clause of that Mishnah, if (the Shi'ur for) four Matanos was mixed with (the Shi'ur for) four Matanos.</p></div>
