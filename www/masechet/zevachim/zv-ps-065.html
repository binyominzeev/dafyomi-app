<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>In the following cases it is Pasul, and there is no Kares:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He intended to eat a k'Zayis (of the meat) Chutz li'Mkomo and a k'Zayis Chutz li'Zmano, or (first he intended for) a k'Zayis Chutz li'Zmano and a k'Zayis Chutz li'Mkomo, or half a k'Zayis Chutz li'Mkomo and a half a k'Zayis Chutz li'Zmano, in either order.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah (argues and) says, the general rule is, if the first intent was Chutz li'Zmano, it is Pigul, and there is Kares. I f the first intent was Chutz li'Mkomo, it is Pasul, and there is no Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Chachamim say, in both cases it is Pasul, and there is no Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If he intended to eat half a k'Zayis (Chutz li'Zmano or Chutz li'Mkomo), and Lehaktir half a k'Zayis (with such intent), it is Kosher, for intent for eating and Haktarah do not join.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one who brings birds must bring at least two, for it says "v'Hikriv Min ha'Torim Oh Min Bnei ha'Yonah" (the plural forms are used)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Hikriv<i>o</i>" - he can bring even one.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>"Ha'Kohen" teaches that a Kohen must do Melikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Kal va'Chomer would have permitted a Zar! Shechitah of animals (of Kodshei Kodoshim) must be in the north, yet a Zar may slaughter. Melikah of birds need not be in the north, all the more a Zar should be Kosher for Melikah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Ha'Kohen" mandates a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that a Kli is used for Melikah! A Kohen is not required for Shechitah, yet a Kli (e.g. knife) is required. A Kohen is required for Melikah, all the more so a Kli should be required!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "ha'Kohen... u'Malak";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva says, we know that a Zar may not ascend the Mizbe'ach for Melikah, therefore "ha'Kohen" is extra, to teach that Melikah is done with (the fingernail of) the Kohen himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Melikah may be done above or below!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "U'Malak...v'Hiktir" - just like Haktarah is on top of the Mizbe'ach, also Melikah.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is from the (front of the) neck!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "u'Malak", like it says about Chatas ha'Of. Just like there it is Mul the Oref, also here.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should say that just like he is not Mavdil in Chatas ha'Of, also in Olas ha'Of!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "U'Malak...v'Hiktir" - just like the head and body are separate during Haktarah, they are separate due to Melikah.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Hiktir Oso" refers to burning the body, so "v'Hiktir ha'Mizbechah" refers to burning the head.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Blood of) Chatas Behemah is offered above, and Olas Behemah.is offered below. Chatas haOf is offered below, all the more so Olas ha'Of should be offered below!</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, he does not squeeze out the blood after Haktarah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, this teaches that just like Haktarah is on top of the Mizbe'ach, also Mitzuy;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He ascends the ramp, turns to the Sovev, and comes to the southeast corner. He is Molek Mul the Oref, is Mavdil, and does Mitzuy against the wall of the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If he did Mitzuy below his feet (i.e. below the Sovev), even an Amah below, it is Kosher (for this is above Chut ha'Sikra);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>R. Nechemyah and R. Eliezer ben Yakov say, it must be done on top of the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye and Rava):</span> The first Tana permits making a Ma'arachah on the Sovev (to burn Olas ha'Of, therefore, Mitzuy may be just below this). R. Nechemyah and R. Eliezer forbid this.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he did not remove the crop...(if he was Mavdil in Chatas ha'Of, it is Pasul).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Our Mishnah is unlike R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon):</span> I heard that the Kohen [may be] Mavdil in Melikah of Chatas ha'Of.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> They argue about whether Mitzuy of Chatas ha'Of is Me'akev (all agree that Chatas ha'Of offered like Olas ha'Of is Pasul):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Our Tana holds that it is Me'akev. Therefore, if he is Mavdil Chatas ha'Of, this is like Avodas Olas ha'Of (Rashi - since also Mitzuy must be done, like Olas ha'Of; Tosfos - since Mitzuy is Me'akev, everything done before it is part of the Avodah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon holds that Mitzuy is not Me'akev, so Havdalah is nothing more than cutting meat. (Rashi - he will not do Mitzuy, so this is unlike Olas ha'Of; Tosfos - the Hakravah ends with Haza'ah, so Havdalah afterwards is meaningless. However, R. Elazar agrees that Havdalah before Haza'ah disqualifies).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> They argue about whether a pause in between cutting the two Simanim of Olas ha'Of disqualifies:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Our Tana holds that it is not Me'akev. Therefore, Havdalah in Chatas ha'Of is like Avodas Olas ha'Of (even though he must pause in between to cut the majority of the flesh (of the neck));</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Elazar holds that it is Me'akev. Therefore, Havdalah in Chatas ha'Of is unlike Avodas Olas ha'Of (in which the Simanim must be cut without pausing in between).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Abaye):</span> (All agree that a pause in between the Simanim of Olas ha'Of disqualifies.) They argue about whether cutting the majority of the flesh in Chatas ha'Of is Me'akev, as R. Zeira and Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak argued:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Our Tana says that it is not Me'akev. Therefore, Havdalah (without pausing in between) is like Olas ha'Of;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Elazar says that it is Me'akev. Therefore, since he must pause in between the Simanim to cut the flesh, it is unlike Olas ha'Of.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue about whether it is Me'akev, but all agree that l'Chatchilah one must cut the majority of the flesh in Chatas ha'Of!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Affirmation:</span> Yes!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> In Melikah of a Chatas, one cuts the spine and neckbone without cutting most of the flesh. When he reaches the Kaneh or Veshet, he cuts one Siman or its majority, and most of the flesh with it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In an Olah, he cuts both Simanim or the majority of both.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>R. Yirmeyah heard the above discussion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yirmeyah):</span> R. Shimon ben Elyakim said that R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon heard that we may be Mavdil in Chatas ha'Of (even before Haza'ah). "Lo Yavdil" means that he need not be Mavdil!</p></div>
