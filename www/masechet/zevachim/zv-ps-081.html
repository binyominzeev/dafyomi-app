<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE ARGUMENT OF R. ELIEZER AND THE CHACHAMIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #6 (Mishnah):</span> If blood that requires four Matanos (e.g. Olah) became mixed with blood that requires one (e.g. Bechor; R. Eliezer says that we do four Matanos...)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps here also, minimal Shi'urim were mixed, and R. Eliezer means that we do four Matanos on behalf of the Olah and one on behalf of the Bechor (i.e. all the blood is thrown)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, R. Yehoshua would not say 'you transgress Bal Tosif' (because (perhaps) all the blood of the Bechor is in one Zerikah, like it should be)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Questions 1-5 - Rava):</span> In the Mishnah and Tosefta, R. Eliezer and Chachamim argue about buckets of blood that became mixed up (but perhaps if the bloods were mixed together, R. Eliezer would say that Ein Bilah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer views blood put in the wrong place as if it were water (therefore, he permits it in order to Machshir the other Korban). Chachamim do not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> They do argue about when the bloods are mixed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> R. Eliezer and Chachamim agree that a mixture of blood of Chatas and Olah is offered;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They agree that if blood of a Rove'a or Nirva was mixed with blood of a Kosher Korban, it is not offered;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They argue about blood of a Ba'al Mum and blood of a Tam that were mixed together;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Eliezer says that we offer it, whether the bloods were mixed together or whether the buckets became mixed up;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Chachamim forbid offering it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> According to R. Yehudah, R. Eliezer permits whether or not the bloods were actually mixed, but Chachamim argue only when they were not mixed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye and Reish Lakish):</span> Chachamim forbid only regarding the first Matanos of Chatas and Olah, but all agree that if Shirayim of Chatas were mixed with Dam Olah we offer it, for they are put in the same place (below).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Yosef):</span> Shirayim must be poured onto the Yesod (but Dam Olah is thrown against the (vertical) edge of the Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Eliezer and Chachamim argue also about Shirayim of Chatas mixed with Dam Olah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna bar Yehudah - Beraisa):</span> (Regarding Bechor it says) "Kodesh Hem" - if it was mixed with other Korbanos, all are offered.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refers to Shirayim of Bechor mixed with Dam Olah, for they are put in the same place.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it refers to Dam Bechor mixed with Dam Olah, neither of which has yet been offered.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p><i>OLIM</i> CANNOT BE <i>MEVATEL</i> EACH OTHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Presumably, this teaches that Olim (Korbanos offered on the Mizbe'ach) are not Mevatel each other - but we already learn this from "V'Lakach mi'Dam ha'Par umi'Dam ha'Sa'ir"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about which verse we learn from.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> Question: "V'Hikrivu Bnei Aharon ha'Kohanim Es ha'Dam...v'Zorku Es ha'Dam" - why does it say "Dam" twice?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">81b----------------------------------------81b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (according to Rashi, Shitah Mekubetzes):</span> One "Dam" teaches that we can offer Dam Olah mixed with blood of its Temurah (or of another Olah or of Chulin), for even if the animals became mixed while alive, they would have been offered (if Semichah is not a problem, e.g. they are of the same owner or of women).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to permit (offering it) it was mixed with blood of Todah or Shelamim (had the animals become mixed up while alive, we would not offer them, for then the meat would go to waste (lest it is the Olah) and/or Semichah cannot be done)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is permitted, since these may be brought voluntarily, like Olah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to permit if it was mixed with Dam Asham?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is permitted, since it requires four Matanos of blood (below), like Olah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to permit if it was mixed with Dam Bechor, Ma'aser or Pesach?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn this from the second "Dam".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question - suggestion:</span> The Beraisa permits when Shirei Dam Olah were mixed with Dam Bechor (or Ma'aser or Pesach), for Shirayim are put in the same place as lower blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the case is, before any Matanos were done, Dam Olah was mixed with Dam Bechor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the only Chidush is that Olim are not Mevatel each other. We already learn this from "mi'Dam ha'Par umi'Dam ha'Sa'ir" (or "Kodesh Hem")!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This Tana argues with the others. He learns from "Dam... Dam."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand why two (of the three) Tana'im do not learn from "v'Lakach mi'Dam ha'Par umi'Dam ha'Sa'ir." They explain that the bloods are not mixed, each is put by itself on the Keranos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We understand why two of the Tana'im do not learn from "Dam... Dam." They hold that these words are not extra to be expounded;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, why do two Tana'im not learn from "Kodesh Hem"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They expound (regarding Bechoros) "Kodesh <i>Hem</i>", but their Temuros are not (fully) Kodesh and are not offered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One Tana learns from "Kodesh Hem." What is his source for the above law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from "Im Shor Im Seh la'Shem <i>Hu</i>" - it is offered, but its Temurah is not offered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If the Kohen (without asking) threw some of the blood above, all agree that he should throw below. He is Yotzei with both bloods.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The case is, Dam Chatas was mixed with Dam Olah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>After the Matanos above, Shirayim of Chatas must be put on the Mizbe'ach. All agree that we put below, for Shirayim are put in the same place as Dam Olah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> The case is, Dam Chatas (before any Matanos were done) was mixed with Shirayim. (After Matanos above, both bloods should be put below).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Why didn't you answer that Shirayim were mixed with Shirayim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps you wanted to teach that even according to the opinion that Shirayim are Me'akev, if some of them are lacking, this is not Me'akev!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava Tosfah):</span> We established the Beraisa when the upper blood was the majority, and he put above more than the amount of lower blood!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> At first we said so to answer for Rav Ashi, who says that R. Eliezer holds Ein Bilah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We concluded that the Beraisa discusses buckets that became mixed.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>INNER AND OUTER BLOODS THAT BECAME MIXED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If inner blood (that should be Nizrak inside the Heichal) was mixed with outer blood (that should be Nizrak on the outer Mizbe'ach), the mixture is spilled to the Amah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If the blood was Nizrak outside and then inside, both Zerikos are Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Akiva says, if the blood was Nizrak inside and then outside, (the inner Zerikah is Kosher;) it (the outer Zerikah) is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Chachamim are Machshir (both);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva disqualifies blood of any Korban that entered the Heichal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, only Dam Chatas becomes Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Eliezer says, even Dam Asham becomes Pasul - "ka'Chatas ka'Asham".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why doesn't R. Eliezer argue also in this Mishnah? (He should permit Zerikah outside and then inside, and view the blood in the wrong place like water!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Just like l'Chatchilah upper blood must be put before lower blood, inner blood must be put before outer blood.</p></div>
