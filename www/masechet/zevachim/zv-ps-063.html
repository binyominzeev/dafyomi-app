<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHERE <i>KEMITZAH</i> MAY BE DONE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kemitzah of Menachos is Kosher anywhere in the Azarah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Male Kohanim eat (the rest of) the Minchah within the hangings (of the Chatzer of the Mishkan, or in the Beis ha'Mikdash, in the Azarah), for one day and a night until midnight.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Elazar):</span> If Kemitzah was done in the Heichal, it is Kosher, for we remove the Levonah from the Lechem ha'Panim in the Heichal, and this corresponds to Kemitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah - Beraisa):</span> "V'Komatz mi'Sham" - anywhere a Yisrael (who brought the Minchah) may stand is Kosher for Kemitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Ben Beseira expounds "mi'Sham" - if he took the Kometz with his left hand, he should return it to the Kli and do Kemitzah with his right hand, i.e. from the place he already took from.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah; some say, R. Yakov):</span> The first Tana merely learns that the entire Azarah is Kosher. (He does not exclude the Heichal.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that since Minchah is Kodshei Kodoshim like Olah, Kemitzah must be in the north, just like Shechitah and Kabalah of an Olah must be in the north.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from Olah, for it is totally consumed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We would have thought to learn from Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from Chatas, for it atones for Chayavei Kerisus!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We would have thought to learn from Asham.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from Asham, for it is a Korban with blood (i.e. animate)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We would have thought to learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah of Olah, Chatas and Asham.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from them, for all of them have blood!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, since it says "v'Hegishah El ha'Mizbe'ach" and "v'Herim Mimenu b'Kumtzo", one might have thought that just like Hagashah (bringing it near the Mizbe'ach) is to the southwest corner, also Kemitzah. (According to our text, the latter verse is in a different Parshah from the former. It is not clear how we learn from one from the other, and why we chose this verse over earlier verses that discuss Kemitzah, e.g. Vayikra 2:2). Perhaps the latter verse should read "vHerim ha'Kohen Min ha'Minchah Es Azkarasah" (Vayikra 2:9), which refers to Kemitzah, and directly follows "v'Hegishah...");</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Therefore, "mi'Sham" teaches that Kemitzah may be anywhere in the Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If Shelamim was slaughtered in the Heichal, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "u'Shchato Pesach Ohel Mo'ed" - the Tafel (secondary, i.e. the Azarah, which is valid for Shechitah only because it faces the Heichal) should not be greater (more Kosher for Shechitah) than the Ikar (what is primary, i.e. the Heichal)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Question (Beraisa - R. Yehudah ben Beseira) Question: If Nochrim surrounded (and were shooting projectiles into) the Azarah, what is the source to permit Kohanim to enter the Heichal to eat (safely) Kodshei Kodoshim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "B'Kodesh ha'Kodoshim Tochalenu."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Why is this verse needed? It says "ba'Chatzer Ohel Mo'ed Yochluha." The Tefel (the Azarah) should not be greater than what is primary (the Heichal)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A slave serves in front of his master. Therefore, it is more proper to slaughter in a more Kadosh place;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A slave does not eat in front of his master. Therefore, it is less proper to eat in a more Kadosh place.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p><i>AVODOS</i> PERFORMED AT THE SOUTHWEST CORNER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chatas ha'Of was offered at the southwest corner of the Mizbe'ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is Kosher anywhere (on the Mizbe'ach), but this is its place. (This will be explained.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We do three things at this corner on top of the Mizbe'ach, and three at the bottom;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Below we offer Chatas ha'Of, do Hagashah of Menachos, and pour Shirayim of blood on the Yesod;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Above we pour Nesachim of wine, and of water (on Sukos), and offer Olas ha'Of when the southeast corner (its proper place) is too crowded.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Anyone who ascends (and must walk around the Mizbe'ach) ascends on the right side, goes around, and descends on the left side;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">63b----------------------------------------63b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The only exceptions are for these three things (done above at this corner). For them, the Kohen (goes straight to his left and) descends the way he came.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of this (that Chatas ha'Of is offered in the southwest)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua):</span> "Lo Yasim Aleha Shemen v'Lo Yiten Aleha Levonah Ki Chatas Hi" - the Torah calls the Minchah (of a sinner) a Chatas, and it calls a Chatas a Minchah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Riva (brought in Shitah Mekubetzes (27)):</span> Just like (Kabalas ha'Dam of) a Chatas (Behemah) must be in the north, also Kidush Kemitzah (putting it into another Kli) of a Minchah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi):</span> Just like Chatas Lo Lishmah is Pasul, also a Minchah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #3 (R. Chayim in Tosfos):</span> Just like Chatas ha'Of must be offered at a corner above the Yesod, also Hagashah of a Minchah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #4 (R. Tam):</span> Just like the right hand must be used for Chatas, also for a Minchah. (end of Version #4)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Also, just like Hagashah of a Minchah must be at the southwest corner, also Haza'ah of Chatas ha'Of.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Hagashah must be in the southwest?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Lifnei Hash-m" (i.e. facing the Heichal) is in the west!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is "El Penei ha'Mizbe'ach" (the south).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "El Penei ha'Mizbe'ach" is in the south!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is "Lifnei Hash-m."</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>To fulfill both verses, it suffices to do Hagashah at the edge of the southwest corner.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion (R. Eliezer):</span> Perhaps Hagashah may be done at the western or southern side of the southwest corner!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If there are two verses and it is possible to fulfill both of them, we do so, rather than fulfilling one in a way that precludes fulfilling the other;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If Hagashah would be done on the west side, we would not fulfill "El Penei ha'Mizbe'ach (the south);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Rather, it is done on the south side, and we fulfill also "Lifnei Hash-m."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does this fulfill "Lifnei Hash-m"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> R. Eliezer holds that the Mizbe'ach is entirely in the north (so the entire south side faces the Heichal.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It is Kosher anywhere, but this is its place.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Melikah is Kosher anywhere (on the Mizbe'ach), but Haza'ah is only in the southwest corner.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>The following Beraisa may be derived from our Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Melikah is Kosher anywhere on the Mizbe'ach. If Haza'ah was done in any place, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>(If Haza'ah was done, but not Mitzuy (pressing the bird against the Mizbe'ach to squeeze out remaining blood), it is Kosher. Shitah Mekubetzes deletes this from the text.) This is provided that it was below the Chut ha'Sikra, and it was Dam ha'Nefesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Melikah is Kosher anywhere on the Mizbe'ach. Mitzuy is Kosher anywhere on the Mizbe'ach, for if Haza'ah was done but not Mitzuy, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Haza'ah must be below the Chut ha'Sikra, and it must be Dam ha'Nefesh.</p></div>
