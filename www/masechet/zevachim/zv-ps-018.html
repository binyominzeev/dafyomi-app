<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Avuha gave a source for Mechusar Begadim. What is the source that Shtuyei Yayin is Mechalel Avodah in an Avodah where a Zar does not incur Misah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn a Gezerah Shavah "Chukah-Chukah" from Mechusar Begadim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tana learned from "u'Lehavdil..."!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was before he learned the Gezerah Shavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tana learned Mechusar Begadim from Shtuyei Yayin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He meant, what is the source that the laws of Shtuyei Yayin, Mechusar Begadim and one who did not wash are all the same (i.e. they are Mechalel Avodah in all Avodos)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He answered, we learn from "Chukah-Chukah".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what do we learn from "u'Lehavdil..."?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn that one may not give rulings after drinking.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav would not teach after drinking on Yom Tov, until the next day, due to intoxication.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We have another source for Mechusar Begadim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"V'Nasenu Bnei <i>Aharon ha'Kohen</i>" - Aharon must be like a (proper) Kohen Gadol. If he served in garments of a regular Kohen, the Avodah is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From there, we would learn only Avodos that are Me'akev Kaparah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We have yet another source for Mechusar Begadim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>"V'Arechu Bnei Aharon ha'Kohanim" - the Kohanim must be in their (proper) Kehunah - if a regular Kohen served in the garments of the Kohen Gadol, the Avodah is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If we only learned from "v'Nasenu...", one might have thought that Avodah with too few garments is Pasul, but extra garments are not Mechalel Avodah. "V'Arechu..." teaches that also this disqualifies.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PROPER GARMENTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the Bigdei Kehunah were dragging on the floor, or too high off the ground (too short), or worn, they are Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If a Kohen wore at once two pairs of Michnesayim (pants), or two Avnetim (belts), or was wearing one garment too little or too many, or if he had a bandage under his garment, the garments were dirty with mud or torn, he is Mechalel Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">18b----------------------------------------18b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If the Bigdei Kehunah were dragging on the floor, the Avodah is Kosher. If they were too high off the ground, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If they were too high off the ground, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rami bar Chama):</span> If the garments are long enough, but the Avnet holds them up too high, it is Kosher. If the garments themselves are too short, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Whether they hang too low or too high, the Avodah is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">The son of Rav Huna's host:</span> Did Shmuel really say that if the garments were dragging, the Avodah is Kosher, and if they were too high, it is Pasul?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa says that if they were too high, it is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> Rami bar Chama already answered that (above).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Rav said that whether they hang too low or too high, the Avodah is Pasul. The Beraisa is Machshir both. We can explain the case of too high like Shmuel did, but) how can you answer for Rav (when they hang too low)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav explains that the Beraisa is Machshir when the garments are 'dragging on the floor', i.e. they are too long, but the Avnet holds them up to the proper length.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, we must say that being held up is like being cut to size;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If so, when they are too high off the ground (even if they are just being held too high, it is as if they are cut too short,) the Avodah should be Pasul! (Why is the Beraisa Machshir?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> Rav explains that the Beraisa discusses one case. If the Bigdei Kehunah were so long that they would drag on the floor, but the Avnet kept them up, the Avodah is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah mi'Difti):</span> Tana'im argue about Bigdei Kehunah that are too long and were not held up. <span class="note">(<span>Note:</span> it seems that this is a second answer to question (i), but 'Amar R. Yirmeyah' connotes otherwise.)</span></p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> "Al Arba Kanfos Kesusecha" excludes a three-cornered garment from Tzitzis.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this excludes only a five-cornered garment!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Asher Techaseh Bah" includes a five-cornered garment. Therefore, "Arba" excludes three (-cornered garments).</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A five cornered garment has four corners. A three cornered garment does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> "Al Arba Kanfos Kesusecha" excludes a three or five-cornered garment from Tzitzis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Tana'im argue about whether we ignore something extra. (The former ignores it. He would be Machshir if Bigdei Kehunah drag on the ground.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all agree that we do not ignore it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Tana expounds "Asher Techaseh Bah" to obligate a five-cornered garment</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It obligates a blind person's garment.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "U'Re'isem Oso" excludes a night garment;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it rather excludes a blind person's garment!</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable to learn this way, because other people see (Techeiles on) a blind person's garment, but no one sees a night garment.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The first Tana learns this from "Asher".</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Vad" teaches that the garments must be linen, new, twined, the threads must be six-fold, and Chulin garments should not be worn with them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> I understand that they must be linen, but they need not be new!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If they are worn, the Avodah is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rav Yosef):</span> How do you understand 'the threads must be six-fold'? "Vad" connotes alone (single-stranded)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer to both questions (Rav Yosef):</span> The Beraisa means, garments that are called "Vad" (i.e. those of a regular Kohen) should be linen, new, twined, of six-fold threads, and Chulin garments should not be worn with them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Some of these conditions are Me'akev. Others are not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that "Vad" means linen?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> It means something that grows individually (one stalk from one seed).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it is wool! (It comes off the sheep in individual strands.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Strands of wool split and become doubled.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Linen (before it is spun) also splits!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It splits only when it is beaten, but not on its own.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> If so, how did we know that it is linen before Yechezkeil taught this verse?</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer to both questions (Ravina):</span> You must say that it was a tradition from Moshe from Sinai. Yechezkeil wrote a verse that alludes to it.</p></div>
