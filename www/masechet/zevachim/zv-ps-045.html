<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava (Tosfos' text - Rav Yosef)):</span> This has no practical application until Mashi'ach will come and the Mikdash will be rebuilt!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question (Abaye):</span> If so, we should not learn Zevachim at all, the laws will not apply until Mashi'ach comes!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is a Mitzvah to learn Zevachim, like every other part of Torah (whether or not it applies today). We receive reward for doing so;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The same applies to Rav Nachman's teaching!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Clarification (Rava):</span> I agree that we should learn and understand the opinions in the Mishnayos, but why should we decide the Halachah?! (R. Chayim in Tosfos - Pigul will not apply when Mashi'ach comes, for everyone will be a Tzadik; Ramah (Sanhedrin 51b) - Eliyahu and his Beis Din will decide the Halachos that will apply then!)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> One is not liable for Pigul, Nosar and Tamei of Kodshim of Nochrim. One who slaughters them outside the Mikdash is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yosi says, he is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Shimon (Tosfos and Shitah Mekubetzes - this Tana is anonymous, i.e. Chachamim):</span> The following apply to Kodshim of Nochrim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One may not benefit from them. One who benefited from them did not transgress Me'ilah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One is not liable for them for Pigul, Nosar and Tamei;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yosi is stringent concerning all of these, for it says "la'Shem" (to include Nochrim);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This applies to Kodshei Mizbe'ach, but Me'ilah applies to Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis (Rashi - this is according to the first Tana; Shitah Mekubetzes - R. Shimon agrees that Me'ilah applies to Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not benefit from them. One who benefited did not transgress Me'ilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>One may not benefit from them mid'Rabanan;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Me'ilah does not apply to them. We learn this from a Gezerah Shavah "Chet-Chet" from Terumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Regarding Terumah it says "Bnei Yisrael" to teach that it does not apply to Nochrim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One is not liable for them for Pigul, Nosar and Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Regarding Tum'ah it says "Bnei Yisrael", to exclude Nochrim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learn Nosar from a Gezerah Shavah "Chilul-Chilul" from Tum'ah, and Pigul from a Gezerah Shavah "Avon-Avon" from Nosar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Temurah does not apply to them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Regarding Ma'aser of Degen (grain), it says "Bnei Yisrael" to exclude Nochrim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Hekesh equates Ma'aser Behemah to Ma'aser Degen, and a Hekesh equates Temurah with Ma'aser Behemah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can something learned from a Hekesh (Ma'aser Behemah) teach about something else (Temurah) through another Hekesh (regarding Kodshim)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ma'aser Degen is Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that it depends on the source we learn from (whether it is Chulin or Kodshim);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>But according to the opinion that it depends on the matter we learn, how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Ma'aser Behemah is an obligation (without a fixed time to bring it). Nochrim bring only Nedarim and Nedavos (voluntary Korbanos);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Nochrim may not bring (just) Nesachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Ezrach" teaches that only a Yisrael brings Nesachim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Olah of a Nochri does not require Nesachim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Kachah" (it requires Nesachim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> I am stringent about all of these... this applies to Kodshei Mizbe'ach...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from a Gezerah Shavah "Chet-Chet" from Terumah, which is Kedushas ha'Guf (and it does not apply to Nochrim), but Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis (monetary Kedushah) applies to Nochrim.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is not R. Yosi. He is stringent to consider Korbanos of Nochrim like those of Yisrael in all respects!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Rav Papa):</span> It is even like R. Yosi. Regarding the Tzitz (which is Meratzeh) it says "LaheM" - for Yisrael, but not for Nochrim.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Nosar and Tamei apply to (all) Kodshim, (even) to which Pigul does not apply, except for blood;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Shimon said (just before he died), one is liable for things that are normally eaten;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One is exempt for eating b'Tum'ah wood, frankincense or Ketores.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one is liable for eating b'Tum'ah only something that has Matirim to people or the Mizbe'ach. A Kal va'Chomer supports this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One who ate Pigul (b'Shogeg) must bring a Chatas Behemah (even if he is poor), he is liable even if he never knew (that it was Pigul before he ate it), and Pigul is never permitted. Even so, it applies only to something that has Matirim;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Korban for Tum'ah (a Tamei who ate Kodshim b'Shogeg) is Oleh v'Yored (a poor person brings a bird), one is liable only if he knew that he was Tamei (and later forgot), it is sometimes permitted (if most of the Tzibur is Tamei, they eat Korban Pesach b'Tum'ah). All the more so, it should apply only to something that has Matirim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Asher Hem Makdishim Li" (includes all Kodshim regarding Tum'ah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one is liable for them (for Tum'ah) from the moment they became Hekdesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Yikrav" (this will be explained);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Eliezer):</span> Is one Chayav Kares just for (Kiruv (coming close), i.e.) touching Kodshim?! (Surely, one is liable only for eating!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the verse discusses Kodshim that became permitted:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it has Matirim, this is after the Matirim were offered;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If it has no Matirim, this is after it was put in a Keli Shares.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn Nosar from a Gezerah Shavah "Chilul-Chilul" from Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Avon-Avon" from Pigul (that it applies only to something with Matirim)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is more reasonable to learn from Tum'ah, for this resembles Nosar regarding GeZeL (an acronym for <i>G</i>uf (a Pesul of the Kodshim or person, as opposed to Pigul, which is a Pesul of intent), <i>Z</i>erikah (does not cause Tamei or Nosar, but it causes Pigul) and Ku<i>L</i>o (Tamei and Nosar need not take effect on the entire Korban, Pigul always does - Tosfos; Rashi - 'Lamed' stands for Chi<i>L</i>ul, the Gezerah Shavah between Nosar and Tum'ah).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It is more reasonable to learn from Pigul, for this resembles Nosar in more respects:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Neither (Nosar or Pigul) is ever permitted (text of Rashi and Tzon Kodoshim), the Tzitz is not Meratzeh for them, they do not pertain to Tum'ah, the Isurim are due to time, and the Isurim pertain only to the meat (whereas Tum'ah applies to one who offers or eats it)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We learn from Levi's Beraisa;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Levi - Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that the verse that forbids Kodshim b'Tum'ah applies also to what is disqualified due to time (Nosar)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Lo Yechalelu..." alludes to two Chilulim (desecrations through eating), Nosar and Tum'ah.</p></div>
