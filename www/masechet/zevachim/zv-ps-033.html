<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>SEMICHAH ON ASHAM METZORA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Ula - Beraisa):</span> Shechitah must always be Tekef l'Semichah, except for Asham Metzora, for which Semichah is by Sha'ar Nikanor;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Metzora cannot enter the Azarah until the blood of the Asham is put on him and the blood of the Chatas is Nizrak.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Bi'ah b'Miktzas were not Bi'ah, he could stick his hands in and do Semichah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rejection (Rav Yosef):</span> The Tana is R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah, who says that Tzafon (the north half of the Azarah, where Kodshei Kodoshim must be slaughtered, begins to the north of the Mizbe'ach, it) is far (22 Amos west) from the end of Ezras Nashim. (Therefore, the Metzora's hands cannot reach to the place of Shechitah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (If Bi'ah b'Miktzas is not Bi'ah,) why didn't they make an opening in the north wall of the Azarah (in line with the Mizbe'ach, so the Metzora could stand outside and enter his hands for Semichah in a valid place for Shechitah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye and Rava):</span> "Ha'Kol bi'Chsav mi'Yad Hash-m... Kol Mal'achos ha'Tavnis" - Hash-m told David the exact form of the Mikdash. We cannot change anything.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rejection (Rav Yosef):</span> To do Semichah in the Azarah, one must enter the majority of his body and his head into the Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One must press down with all his strength.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Therefore, the Metzora cannot do Semichah from Sha'ar Nikanor. (End of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Tana's opinion regarding Asham Metzora?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer:</span> The Torah requires Semichah, and Shechitah must be Tekef after Semichah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the Torah allows the Metzora to fully enter the Azarah (even though this is normally forbidden)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Defense of Answer #1 (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> Mid'Oraisa, he should enter. Chachamim decreed not to, lest he enter further than necessary (and be Chayav Kares).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> The Torah requires Semichah, but Shechitah need not be Tekef l'Semichah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "V'Samach... v'Shachat" - just like only a Tahor can do Semichah, only a Tahor can slaughter.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If mid'Oraisa Shechitah need not be Tekef, a Tamei can do Semichah (outside the Azarah, and the Korban will be brought in for Shechitah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction - Answer (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> The Torah does not require Semichah of Asham Metzora, but (when Semichah is required), Shechitah must be Tekef l'Semichah.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>BI'AH B'MIKTZAS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> Ula taught (32b, in the name of Reish Lakish, that Bi'as Mikdash b'Miktzas is Bi'ah) about lashes, but not about Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> Reish Lakish expounded to teach about a Tamei who touched Kodesh (and not about Bi'as b'Miktzas);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If a Tamei touched Kodesh, he is lashed;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He learns from "b'Chol Kodesh Lo Siga".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He is not lashed.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"B'Chol Kodesh..." refers to Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reish Lakish says that the verse forbids a Tamei to <i>eat</i> Kodesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which verse forbids a Tamei to eat Kodesh?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> "B'Chol Kodesh Lo Siga."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan - Bardela - Beraisa):</span> We learn a Gezerah Shavah "Tum'aso- Tum'aso" from a Tamei who entered the Mikdash. Just like that is Chayavei Kerisus and a verse forbids it, also a Tamei who eats Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reish Lakish learns both from the verse;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since it says "Siga" (touching), it forbids touching;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"B'Chol Kodesh Lo Siga... (v'El ha'Mikdash Lo Savo)" forbids (a Tamei) to eat Kodesh, for it is equated to entering the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Reish Lakish - Beraisa):</span> "B'Chol Kodesh Lo Siga" forbids eating.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it forbids touching!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "...V'El ha'Mikdash Lo Savo" - the Isur (Lo Siga) of Kodesh is equated to entering the Mikdash. Just like one is Chayav Misah b'Yedei Shamayim for the latter (it is included in Kares), also Lo Siga, i.e. eating Kodesh while Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>One is not Chayav Misah for touching.</p></div>
