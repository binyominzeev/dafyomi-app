<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Huna bar Noson was once in front of the Persian king. Huna's belt was too high. The king lowered it to his elbows, and told him 'you are "Mamleches Kohanim v'Goy Kadosh."' (Therefore, you must conduct like Kohanim, and not gird belts where you sweat.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> "V'Hayu Melachim Omnayich (kings will be your foster parents)" was fulfilled with Huna bar Noson.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MINOR CHATZITZOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kohen bruised his finger on Shabbos, he wraps a reed over it in the Mikdash;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is forbidden outside the Mikdash (Rashi - because it heals; Tosfos - lest he squeeze out blood).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In all places, one may not squeeze out blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Yehudah brei d'R. Chiya):</span> Only a reed is permitted, but a small belt is forbidden, for it is an extra garment.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Extra garments are forbidden only in the places where Bigdei Kehunah are worn.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should be forbidden because it is a Chatzitzah (blockage) (between his skin and the Avodah. He must hold the Korban or Keli Shares with his hand!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answers:</span> The bruise was on his left hand, or on a part of the right hand not used for Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rava argues with R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> In the places where Bigdei Kehunah are worn, even a thread is a Chatzitzah. In other places, only a garment three Tefachim by three Tefachim is a Chatzitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must we say that Rava also argues with R. Yehudah brei d'R. Chiya?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. Since a small belt is decorative, it is considered like a garment three Tefachim by three Tefachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Yehudah brei d'R. Chiya):</span> Only a reed is permitted, but a small belt is forbidden (it is a Chatzitzah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Extra garments less than three Tefachim by three Tefachim are a Chatzitzah only in the places where Bigdei Kehunah are worn. Elsewhere, only garments of three Tefachim is a Chatzitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>This is like Rava.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yochanan (who permits a small belt, at least in Version #1), why did the Mishnah permit a reed? It should have said that even a small belt is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana taught in passing that a reed heals.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Leviyim and Yisraelim are not forbidden (for they do not do Avodah), only exempt. Therefore it says 'exempt', which applies to all of them.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is mid'Oraisa. Since it says "Chukah", they should be Me'akev!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> "U'Levesham" - wearing the garments is Me'akev, but not anything else (in the verse).</p></div>
