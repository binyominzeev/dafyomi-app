<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>KEDUSHAH OF THE <i>LISHKOS</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Liability for a entering the Mikdash (b'Tum'ah) is only for (entering the Azarah, a rectangle) 187 Amos by 135 Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(A reciter of Beraisos):</span> The entire Azarah was 187 Amos by 135 Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> My father taught that this is the place where Kodshei Kodoshim may be eaten, where Kodshim Kalim may be slaughtered, and for which one is liable for entering b'Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to exclude?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He excludes the windows, doors and the thickness of the walls of the Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Mishnah teaches that they have Kedushas Azarah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The windows, and the thickness of the walls of the Azarah are like the inside of the Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He excludes Lishkos (chambers in the walls of the Azarah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He cannot exclude them if they are built outside the Azarah but their only opening is to the Azarah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (The inside of) a chamber built in Chol (i.e. outside the Azarah) whose only opening is to the Azarah is Kodesh (like the Azarah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He does exclude them (mid'Oraisa), the law of that Mishnah is mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is mid'Oraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that Kohanim may eat the remainder of Menachos (after Kemitzah) and Kodshei Kodoshim inside a chamber built in Chol open (only) to the Azarah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (It already said "b'Makom Kadosh", therefore) "ba'Chatzer Ohel Mo'ed Yochluha" is extra to permit eating in many Chatzeros.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The law of eating is different (due to this verse).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also regarding Tum'ah they are Kodesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following apply inside a chamber built in Chol open to the Azarah:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Kodshei Kodoshim may be eaten, Kodshim Kalim may not be slaughtered, and one is liable for entering b'Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must correct the Beraisa. Just like it says that Kodshim Kalim may not be slaughtered, it should say that one is <i>not</i> liable for entering b'Tum'ah:</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand why one may not slaughter there. (Even though it is Kodesh,) it does not face the Pesach (of Ohel Mo'ed);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, why should one be exempt for Tum'ah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> The Beraisa forbids Shechitah even from a part of the chamber (e.g. the opening) that faces Pesach Ohel Mo'ed!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it did not, there would be no Chidush. Always, Shechitah must face the Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that one may not slaughter even from a part that faces the Pesach, because it is not Kodesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Likewise, one is exempt for Tum'ah for this reason.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also to eat, one must face the Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> There were two openings in Beis ha'Chalifos eight Amos tall, to permit eating Kodshei Kodoshim and Shechitah of Kodshim Kalim in the entire Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> We must delete 'eating Kodshei Kodoshim' from the text.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Bashlu Es ha'Basar Pesach Ohel Mo'ed v'Sham Tochlu Oso"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was a special law of Korbanos ha'Milu'im. It does not apply to all generations.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>BLOOD IS DISQUALIFIED AT SUNDOWN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi):</span> What is the source that blood becomes Pasul at sundown? (Tosfos - for all other laws of the Torah, the day ends later, at Tzeis ha'Kochavim. Here is different. Rashi - also here, sundown refers to Tzeis ha'Kochavim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "B'Yom Hakrivo Es Zivcho Ye'achel" - you can offer (the blood) only on the same day of the Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need to the verse to teach about eating. It is not extra to expound other laws!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">56b----------------------------------------56b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it should have said 'b'Yom Zivcho Ye'achel';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Hakrivo" is extra to teach about the blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the Torah teaches that if the blood is offered today, the meat may be eaten today and tomorrow. If it is offered tomorrow, the meat may be eaten tomorrow and the following day!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it should have said 'b'Yom Hakrivo Ye'achel';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Zivcho" is extra to teach the blood must be offered on the day of Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> If an Avodah was done with intent to eat the meat (of a Korban eaten for two days) on the night (after this) preceding the third day, the Korban is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It is Pigul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chizkiyah says that it is Kosher, because he did not intend for the time when the Nosar must be burned;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yochanan says that it is Pigul because he intended for a time when it may not be eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> If one ate meat (of a Korban eaten for two days) on the night before the third day, he is exempt (from Kares (if Mezid) or a Chatas);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chizkiyah exempts because it was not yet time for the meat to be burned;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yochanan obligates because the permitted time to eat elapsed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> Intent (Chutz li'Zmano) for Kodshim that may be eaten for one day is to throw the blood after sundown or to eat the meat or offer the Eimurim after Amud ha'Shachar;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chutz li'Zmano for Kodshim eaten for two days is to throw the blood after sundown, to offer the Eimurim after Amud ha'Shachar, or to eat the meat after sundown of the second day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> We should say that the meat (of Kodshim eaten for two days) may be eaten the following night!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learn from Kodshim eaten for one day. The following night is permitted. The same should apply to Kodshim eaten for two days!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Veha'Nosar Ad Yom (ha'Shelishi)" - it may be eaten (only) Ad Yom (while it is still day), but not on the night of the third day (Rashi; Tosfos - what is left Ad (up to, but not including) Yom ha'Shelishi is Nosar).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should say that it is burned immediately (at the start of the third night)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learn from Kodshim eaten for one day. They are burned right after they are forbidden to eat (after Amud ha'Shachar). The same should apply to Kodshim eaten for two days!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ba'Yom ha'Shelishi ba'Esh Yisaref" (Vayikra 7:17) - we burn Kodshim during the day, but not at night.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p><i>BECHOR</i>, <i>MA'ASER</i> AND <i>PESACH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Bechor, Ma'aser and Pesach are Kodshim Kalim. They may be slaughtered anywhere in the Azarah,</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One Matanah of blood is required. It must be above the Yesod.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The laws of eating them are different;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Bechor is eaten by Kohanim. Anyone may eat Ma'aser. Both of them are eaten within Yerushalayim, cooked in any way, for two days and the night in between;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Pesach is eaten only at night (but not the day it is offered), and only until midnight. Only those Manuyim on it (i.e. they own a share) may eat it, and it is eaten only roasted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah (who equates Matanas Dam of Bechor (Rashi, according to Shitah Mekubetzes - which is thrown, and not poured) to that of Ma'aser and Pesach)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is R. Yosi ha'Galili;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Galili):</span> (Regarding Bechor) it does not say 'Damo' and 'Cheblo', rather, "Damam" and "Chelbam" (<i>their</i> blood and Chelev). This teaches that the blood and Eimurim of Ma'aser and Pesach are put on the Mizbe'ach (like Bechor).</p></div>
