<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p><i>AVODOS</i> PERFORMED AT THE SOUTHWEST CORNER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Three things are done (at this corner...below)...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We already explained Chatas ha'Of;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text):</span> We learn Hagashah from "v'Higishah El ha'Mizbe'ach" (Vayikra 2:8. Shitah Mekubetzes - this teaches about all Menachos, and that they must be touched to the Mizbe'ach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi):</span> We learn Hagashah from "Hakrev Osah... Lifnei Hash-m El Penei ha'Mizbe'ach" (Vayikra 6:7. The verse connotes the southwest corner, like above.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We learn Shirayim from "v'Es Kol Dam ha'Par Yishpoch El Yesod Mizbach" (no other part of the southern side has a Yesod).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Above we do Nesachim of wine and water, and Olas ha'Of when the southeast corner is too crowded.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Olas ha'Of preferably done in the southeast corner?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It is the closest corner to Beis ha'Deshen (where the crop and feathers are thrown).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> This shows how strong Kohanim were. The lightest parts of a bird (and hence the hardest to throw) are the crop and feathers. Sometimes the Kohen would have to throw them more than 30 Amos (i.e. from the southwest corner to Beis ha'Deshen)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (To do Terumas ha'Deshen,) the Kohen took a silver pan and ascended the Mizbe'ach. He turned coals aside, and took from the thoroughly burned ones (ashes) underneath;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He descended to the ground, turned north, and went 10 Amos along the east of the ramp. He piled the ashes on the floor three Tefachim away from the ramp, where they put the crop and feathers (of Olas ha'Of), and the ashes of the inner Mizbe'ach and the Menorah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is more than 31 Amos (Beis ha'Deshen is 22 Amos south of the southwest corner, and 22 and a half Amos east)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not count the Amah where the Kohen stands. It is as if he throws it only 30 (and a third) Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Anyone who ascends...(except for three things...)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't he circle around for these?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> We are concerned lest the Nesachim absorb the smoke (and become disqualified), and lest the bird die from the smoke.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> If the Kohen Gadol wants (to offer Nesachim), he circles around the Mizbe'ach, traversing the southeast, northeast, northwest and southwest corners. They give him (from the beginning) the wine for the Nesachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> No, he is not carrying the Nesachim when he goes around.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">64b----------------------------------------64b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rava):</span> It says, they <i>give</i> him (i.e. after going around) the wine for the Nesachim. It does not say 'they tell him to pour it.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Anyone who ascends the Mizbe'ach goes up on the right and descends on the left; he goes up on the east and descends on the west, except for one who ascends for these three things;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>For the three, he goes up and descends on the west, he goes up and descends on the right.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> He does not go up and descend on the right, rather, on the left!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> We must correct the text to say 'he goes up and descends on the left.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> 'Right' means the right side of the Mizbe'ach. (We consider south to be the face of the Mizbe'ach, so the west is its right.) 'Left' means the Kohen's left.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa should be consistent. Left and right should both refer to the Mizbe'ach, or both to the Kohen!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>This is left difficult.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p><i>CHATAS HA'OF</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> To offer Chatas ha'Of, the Kohen is Molek (presses his fingernail and cuts the back of the neck) Mul (in line with, below) the Oref (back of the head). He does not Mavdil (separate the head from the body. Rather, he cuts only one of the Simanim (the foodpipe or windpipe);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>He sprinkles the blood on the wall of the Mizbe'ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The remaining blood (is squeezed against the wall and) drops onto the Yesod.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Only its blood goes on the Mizbe'ach. All the meat is eaten by Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "V'Hizah mi'Dam ha'Chatas" - from the bird itself;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He holds the head and body and sprinkles on the lower half of the wall of the Mizbe'ach, but not on the wall of the ramp, Heichal or Ulam.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches that he should sprinkle on the top half of the wall!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Regarding animals, (blood of) an Olah is offered below (on the lower half of the wall), and a Chatas is offered above. Olas ha'Of is offered above, all the more so Chatas ha'Of should be offered above!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Veha'Nish'ar ba'Dam Yimatzei El Yesod ha'Mizbe'ach" - he sprinkles on a (part of the) wall from which the Shirayim (the blood, after it is put on it) fall to the Yesod. (From the top half, the blood falls onto the Sovev.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He could sprinkle on the top half, and squeeze the rest against the lower half!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> It does not say 'Yamtzeh' (he will squeeze), rather, "Yimatzei", which (additionally) connotes that the sprinkled blood will be found on (i.e. fall by itself to) the Yesod.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra bar Tuvya):</span> In Melikah of Chatas ha'Of, the Kohen holds the wings in two fingers, and the legs in two fingers, and stretches the neck over the width of his thumb, and cuts it with his thumbnail.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The bird faces outside. He holds the wings in two fingers, and the legs in two fingers, and stretches the neck over the width of two fingers, and cuts it with his thumbnail;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is the difficult Avodah in the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> There are other difficult Avodos in the Mikdash, i.e. Kemitzah and Chafinah (taking two handfuls of Ketores)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> This is one of the most difficult Avodos in the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p><i>OLAS HA'OF</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> To offer Olas ha'Of, the Kohen ascends the ramp, turns to the Sovev, and comes to the southeast corner;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Melikah is done Mul the Oref. He is Mavdil (fully cuts both Simanim), and presses the bird against the Mizbe'ach to squeeze out the blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>He takes the head, points the cut neck towards the Mizbe'ach, salts it and throws it on the fire.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>He removes the crop, (the surrounding skin with) feathers and the intestines that come out with the crop, and throws all these to Beis ha'Deshen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>He tears the wings, but does not tear them off the body. If he tore them off, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>He salts the body and throws it on the fire;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he did not remove the crop, feathers and intestines, or did not salt it, it is Kosher, for deviations after squeezing out the blood do not disqualify it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he fully cut both Simanim in Chatas ha'Of, or did not do so in Olas ha'Of, it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he squeezed out the blood of the head but not of the body, it is Pasul. If he squeezed out the blood of the body but not of the head, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p><i>PESUL</i> AND <i>PIGUL</i> OF <i>KORBANOS HA'OF</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>If Melikah of Chatas ha'Of or Mitzuy (squeezing the blood) or both were done Lo Lishmah, it is Pasul. Regarding Olas ha'Of, it is Kosher, but the owner was not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Regarding Chatas and Olas ha'Of, if he did Melikah or Mitzuy with improper intent to eat something normally eaten (i.e. Chatas ha'Of) or Lehaktir something normally burned on the Mizbe'ach, the law is as follows.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the intent was Chutz li'Mkomo, the Korban is Pasul, and there is no Kares for eating it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the intent was Chutz li'Zmano, the Korban is Pigul, and there is Kares for eating it, provided that there was no other Pesul in the Matirim (these two Avodos, which permit the meat to Kohanim or the Mizbe'ach).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The case when there was no other Pesul is when Melikah and Mitzuy were both done (with intent) Chutz li'Zmano, or one was with this intent and the other without any Pasul intent;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The case when there was another Pesul is when one or both of these two Avodos were done Chutz li'Mkomo (or Lo Lishmah, in the case of Chatas ha'Of).</p></div>
