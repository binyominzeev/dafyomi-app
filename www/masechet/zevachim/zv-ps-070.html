<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHICH <i>CHELEV</i> IS <i>TAHOR</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (against Conclusion 3:i:5, 69b):</span> We do not need "Treifah" to exclude Tamei animals (regarding Chelev). "Chelev Neveilah" refers to animals whose Chelev is forbidden due to Chelev, and not due to eating a Tamei species!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 3:i):</span> Rather, "Treifah" (in the verse of Chelev) includes (R. Tam's text - excludes) Chayos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Rashi):</span> One might have thought that the Torah is Metaher Chelev only in animals whose Chelev is forbidden and whose meat is permitted, but not in Chayos (whose Chelev and meat are permitted). "Treifah" teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Tam):</span> "Treifah" teaches that the Torah is Metaher Chelev only in animals whose Chelev is forbidden and whose meat is permitted, but not in Chayos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> Why don't we say that the verse teaches about Tamei animals (whose meat and Chelev are both forbidden)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> (The verse regarding Chelev says) "v'Achol Lo Sochluhu" (surely, this does not apply to Chayos, their Chelev is permitted; R. Tam - therefore, "Treifah" is not needed to exclude them)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Abaye):</span> Rather, "Treifah" (simply) is Metaher Chelev of a Treifah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that since it is forbidden while alive, like a Tamei animal, its Chelev is Tamei. "Treifah" teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> Likewise, we should need "Treifah" regarding Nivlas Of to teach that a Treifah has Tum'as Beis ha'Beli'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that since one may not eat it, like a Tamei bird, it does not have Tum'as Beis ha'Beli'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> We cannot learn Treifah, which once was (potentially) permitted (it could have been slaughtered before it became Treifah), from Tamei, which was forbidden from birth!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Attempted answer):</span> "Treifah" is needed for a Behemah (or bird) born Treifah. Since it was forbidden from birth, we could learn from Tamei!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Even this case we cannot learn, for within the species of (Tahor) Treifos are Behemos (or birds) born Kosher, which were once permitted, unlike Teme'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> "Neveilah" teaches that when an animal becomes a Neveilah, the Isur of Neveilah is Chal (takes effect) on the Chelev (even though the Chelev was already forbidden). "Treifah" teaches that the Isur Tereifah is Chal on the Chelev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>The Torah must teach both;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it said only "Neveilah", one might have thought that it is Chal on the Chelev, because Neveilah is Tamei, but Treifah is not Chal on it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it said only "Treifah", one might have thought that it is Chal on the Chelev, because Treifah is Chal on live animals, but Neveilah does not take effect on it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Meir expound "Treifah" (in the verse of Nivlas Of)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It excludes a bird slaughtered in the Mikdash (even though one may not eat it, it is not Metamei).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "Treifah" twice regarding Nivlas Of. R. Yehudah expounds one of them like R. Meir, and the other to teach that a slaughtered Treifah is Metamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir uses the other "Treifah" to exclude a Tamei bird.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehudah excludes a Tamei bird from "Neveilah" (for it is not forbidden due to Neveilah, rather, because it is a Tamei species).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Meir expound "Neveilah" (regarding Nivlas Of)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that one becomes Tamei after eating (the amount for which one is liable for eating Treifah, i.e.) a k'Zayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already know this, for one of the verses discusses one who eats Nivlas Of, and eating always refers to a k'Zayis!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We need to learn that it must be eaten within Kdei Achilas Pras (the time to eat half a loaf the size of six or eight eggs. Opinions of this range from two to nine minutes);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One might have thought that since Tum'as Beis ha'Beli'ah is a Chidush, it applies even if it was eaten slower. The Torah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Chelev Treifah v'Chelev Neveilah (is Tahor)" discusses a Tahor animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it discusses a Tamei animal!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Torah teaches that Shechitah is Metaher, and that Chelev is Tahor;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Just like it is Metaher Shechitah only of Tahor species, it is Metaher Chelev only of Tahor animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should learn differently! The Torah is Metaher Neveilos (this will be explained), and it is Metaher Chelev;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Just like it is Metaher Neveilos only of Tamei species, it is Metaher Chelev only in Tamei species!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">70b----------------------------------------70b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> It would not be clear which way to learn, therefore the Torah needed to say "Treifah", i.e. animals in which Treifah applies. This excludes Teme'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should not exclude Chayos, for Treifah applies to them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Achol Lo Sochluhu" - the Torah discusses animals whose Chelev is forbidden and whose meat is permitted, but not Chayos, for their Chelev and meat are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yakov bar Ada):</span> (The Beraisa says that the Torah is Metaher Neveilos only in Tamei species.) This implies that the Neveilah of a Tahor Behemah is Teme'ah, but that of a Tamei Behemah is not!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Also others misunderstood this. The Beraisa (n:3:i) means that the Torah is Metaher Neveilos only of Tamei species <i>of birds</i> (but not of Tahor species).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>CAN BEHEADING BE <i>METAHER</i> FROM <i>TUM'AS NEVEILAH</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Meir is Metaher Melikah of a Tam (unblemished) bird, but not of a Ba'al Mum;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> He is Metaher even a Ba'al Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Bivi citing R. Elazar):</span> He is Metaher even a Ba'al Mum, even a chicken or goose (which is invalid for a Korban).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> (According to Rav Bivi) if a goat was Arufah (beheaded, instead of a calf, where a corpse was found), does it become a Neveilah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps Melikah is Metaher chickens and geese, for they are birds, just like Torim and doves, to which Melikah applies, but goats are small animals, which is a different classification than calves (cattle are large (work) animals);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps it suffices that also goats are animals!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> The question assumes that an Eglah Arufah is not a Neveilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer: (Rav Dimi):</span> Yes! Regarding Eglah Arufah it says "Kaparah", like it says regarding Kodshim. (We learn from Kodshim birds. When they are killed according to Halachah, even if this was not Shechitah, they are Tehorim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Noson, father of Rav Huna - Beraisa):</span> "(The Chelev is Tahor, but) v'Achol Lo Sochluhu" refers to animals whose Chelev is forbidden to eat, but one may benefit from it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to include Chelev of a Shor ha'Niskal or Eglah Arufah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Kol Chelev" includes these.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If Eglah Arufah is Tahor, why must we learn from a verse that its Chelev is Tahor? We would never think that it is Tahor and its Chelev is Tamei (just the opposite of regular animals that died without Shechitah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Indeed, if the calf was Arufah (like it should be), the verse is not needed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The verse teaches about the case when it was slaughtered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If it was slaughtered, it is Tahor (so surely, also its Chelev is Tahor)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the verse teaches about when it died without Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Since a verse is needed to teach about this case, it must be that Eglah Arufah is forbidden when it is alive (otherwise, it would be like a regular Neveilah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Confirmation:</span> This is correct!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> I was taught the time when it becomes forbidden. I do not remember it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> Presumably, when it is taken to the Nachal Eisan it becomes forbidden.</p></div>
