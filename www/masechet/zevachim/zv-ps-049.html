<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Mari):</span> We find Tafel Chamur Min ha'Ikar. Ma'aser Sheni (produce) can be redeemed, but produce bought with money of Ma'aser Sheni cannot be redeemed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If produce bought with money of Ma'aser Sheni became Tamei, it may be redeemed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it must be buried. (Rashi - the question is from R. Yehudah, who never allows redeeming produce bought with Ma'aser money. Tosfos - some explain that the question is from Chachamim, who never allow redeeming Tahor produce bought with Ma'aser money, even outside of Yerushalayim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is not a stringency of produce bought with Ma'aser money. Rather, its Kedushah is too weak to transfer onto money! (We find that it is harder to redeem produce worth less than a Perutah than produce worth more than a Perutah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We find Tafel Chamur Min ha'Ikar regarding Temurah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Hekdesh does not take effect on a Ba'al Mum (to make it Kedushas ha'Guf), but Temurah takes effect on it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Temurah is not more potent, it only imparts Kedushah from Kodshim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Hekdesh created the Kedushah from Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We find Tafel Chamur Min ha'Ikar regarding Korban Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Pesach does not require Semichah, Nesachim, or Tenufah of the Chazah v'Shok, but (if it was not offered on Pesach it becomes) Mosar Pesach (and) requires these!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mosar Pesach becomes a Shelamim. Therefore, it is not considered Tafel to Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p><i>ASHAM</i> IS OFFERED IN <i>TZAFON</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 5:a, 48b):</span> "Ha'Olah" - its Shechitah and Kabalah must be in the proper place. (If not, it is Pasul.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Tzafon is required for Asham?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Bi'Mkom Asher Yishchatu Es ha'Olah Yishchatu Es ha'Asham."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about Shechitah. What is the source for Kabalah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "v'Es Damo Yizrok." (Since Zerikah is not in Tzafon,) we use this to teach that Kabalah is in Tzafon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the Kohen who is Mekabel must be in Tzafon?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "<i>V'Es</i> Damo" is extra to teach this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We find that l'Chatchilah, all must be in Tzafon. What is the source that this is Me'akev?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Shachat Es ha'Keves."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This verse teaches something else!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Something that was part of a Klal (category), and the Torah taught a law about it unlike other elements of the Klal, the laws governing the rest of the Klal do not apply to it unless the Torah explicitly says that they do (returns it to the Klal);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>An example is "v'Shachat Es ha'Keves bi'Mkom Asher Yishchat Es ha'Chatas v'Es ha'Olah bi'Mkom ha'Kodesh Ki ka'Chatas ha'Asham Hu";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the Torah teach "ka'Chatas ha'Asham"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because the Torah taught a Chidush about Asham Metzora, that some of the blood is put on the ear, thumb and toe, one might have thought that its blood and Eimurim are not put on the Mizbe'ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"Ka'Chatas ha'Asham" teaches that it is like a Chatas, and the blood and Eimurim are put on the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the Torah wanted to teach only the law of this Beraisa, it would have taught Tzafon in this verse and not in "Zos Toras ha'Asham" (which teaches about all Ashamos), and we would have learned the other Ashamos from Asham Metzora.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is a good answer if we hold that the exception to the Klal is not learned from the Klal, but it teaches to the Klal;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">49b----------------------------------------49b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, if we hold that the exception is not learned from the Klal and does not teach about the Klal, the Torah must teach Tzafon in other Ashamos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Once the Torah teaches that Asham Metzora is like a Chatas, we already know Tzafon;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"V'Shachat Es ha'Keves bi'Mkom..." is extra to teach that Tzafon is Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Mari):</span> We should say that the Torah returned Asham Metzora to the Klal (of Ashamos) only for Avodos that require Kehunah, such as Zerikah and Haktaras Eimurim, but not regarding (Shechitah in) Tzafon!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it should have said 'ka'Chatas Hu';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, it says "ka'Chatas ha'Asham" to teach that it is like other Ashamos (they require Tzafon).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>LEARNING HEKESH MI'HEKESH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (It says "v'Shachat... bi'Mkom... ha'Chatas v'Es ha'Olah.") Why must the Torah equate (the place of Shechitah of) Asham to (that of) Chatas and Olah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> Had the Torah equated it only to Chatas, one might have thought that we can learn from a Hekesh (to something learned) from a Hekesh (even in Kodshim). We would learn Asham from Chatas (which was learned from Olah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Therefore, the Torah was Makish also to Olah, to teach that we could not learn from the Hekesh to Chatas, for Chatas itself was learned from a Hekesh.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Mari):</span> It would have sufficed to Makish Asham to Olah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> If so, we would not learn that we cannot learn Hekesh mi'Hekesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we could deduce this from the fact that the Torah made the Hekesh to Olah, and not to Chatas!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. We would say that even though we can learn Hekesh mi'Hekesh, the Torah preferred to make the Hekesh from the source;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rather, the Torah made a Hekesh to Chatas and to Olah, to teach that we cannot learn Hekesh mi'Hekesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The following is the source that we cannot learn Hekesh mi'Hekesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "Ka'asher Yuram mi'Zevach ha'Shelamim" (written regarding Par Mashu'ach)?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It need not teach that we offer the Yoseres ha'Kaved and kidneys. It explicitly mentions them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We need to learn Yoseres ha'Kaved and kidneys from Par He'elem Davar to Se'iri Avodah Zarah, but we learned them regarding Par He'elem Davar only from a Hekesh to Par Mashu'ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Since "Ka'Asher Yuram..." need not teach about Par Mashu'ach, we use it to teach about Par He'elem Davar. It is as if Yoseres ha'Kaved and the kidneys were explicitly mentioned regarding Par He'elem Davar. (We infer that normally, we cannot learn Hekesh mi'Hekesh.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Why didn't the Torah explicitly write Yoseres ha'Kaved and the kidneys regarding Par He'elem Davar (instead of the Hekesh)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If so, we would not learn that we cannot learn Hekesh mi'Hekesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we would deduce this from the fact that the Torah wrote them explicitly regarding Par He'elem Davar, and did not make a Hekesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. We would say that even though we can learn Hekesh mi'Hekesh, the Torah preferred to write it explicitly;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rather, the Torah made a Hekesh where the law was already explicit, to teach that we cannot learn Hekesh mi'Hekesh.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>OTHER CASES OF <i>LAMED MI'LAMED</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>We cannot learn Hekesh mi'Hekesh. We learn this from Ravina or Rava.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can (something learned from) a Gezerah Shavah teach through a Hekesh?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Answer (Beraisa - R. Noson ben Avtulmus) Question: What is the source that if Tzara'as spreads over an entire garment, it is Tahor?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It mentions "Karachas" and "Gabachas" regarding (plagued) garments, like it does regarding Tzara'as of the head;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Just like there, if Tzara'as spreads over the entire head it is Tahor, also regarding garments.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that if Tzara'as spreads over the entire head, it is Tahor?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tzara'as of the head is Hukash to Tzara'as of the skin, about which it says "Kulo Hafach Lavan (Tahor Hu)."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> We always learn Lamed from Lamed, except in Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If we did learn Lamed from Lamed in Kodshim, the Torah would not need to (make a Hekesh to) teach that Asham requires Tzafon. We would have learned from the Gezerah Shavah "Kodshei Kodoshim-Kodshei Kodoshim" from Chatas!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Since the Torah made such a Hekesh, this teaches that (something learned from) a Hekesh (e.g. that Chatas requires Tzafon) cannot teach through a Gezerah Shavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps, normally, we can learn, but here there is a Pirchah (challenge) against it. Chatas atones for Chayavei Kerisus (and Asham does not)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both sides of the Gezerah Shavah "Kodshei Kodoshim-Kodshei Kodoshim" are extra. If we could learn from a Gezerah Shavah to something learned from a Hekesh, we would not ask a Pirchah.</p></div>
