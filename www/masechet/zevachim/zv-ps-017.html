<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Tevul Yom (is Mechalel Avodah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Simai):</span> "Kedoshim Yihyu... v'Lo Yechalelu" hints that a Tevul Yom is Mechalel Avodah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since we already know that a Tamei is Mechalel Avodah from "va'Yinazru...", we use this verse to teach about a Tevul Yom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we use it to teach that a Kohen who tore his hair or shaved the corners of his beard (the Mitzvos written just before "Kedoshim Yihyu") is Mechalel Avodah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn that a Tevul Yom is Chayav Misah for Avodah from a Gezerah Shavah "Chilul-Chilul" (from Terumah to this verse), therefore, we only learn that one who disqualifies Terumah is Mechalel Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> Why must the Torah teach separately that a Tamei, Tevul Yom and Mechusar Kipurim are Mechalel Avodah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it taught only about a Tamei, we would have thought that this is because he is Metamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it taught only about a Tevul Yom, we could not have learned to Mechusar Kipurim, who is permitted to eat Terumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it taught only about a Mechusar Kipurim, we could not have learned about a Tevul Yom, for he becomes (fully) Tahor automatically.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Granted, none of these three could teach the other two. Perhaps one of them could be learned from the other two!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which could be learned from the others?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We cannot learn Mechusar Kipurim from the others, for they are forbidden to eat Terumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We can learn Tevul Yom from the (Tzad ha'Shavah of the) others.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> They do not become Tahor automatically!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tum'ah of Mechusar Kipurim became lighter (he already immersed), so all he needs is a Korban. Since a Tamei does not need a Korban, we can learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">17b----------------------------------------17b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He holds that a Zav who (completed most of the Taharah process but still) is Mechusar Kipurim is like a (fully Tamei) Zav. (Rashi - he is Chayav Kares for eating Kodshim or entering the Mikdash, and he is Metamei Kodshim like a Zav; Tosfos - even when most of Yisrael are Tamei Mes and are permitted to bring Korban Pesach in Tum'ah, he is forbidden.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about whether a Zav who is Mechusar Kipurim is like a Zav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If an Onen or Mechusar Kipurim burned the Parah Adumah, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Yosef ha'Bavli says, if an Onen burned it, it is Kosher. If a Mechusar Kipurim burned it, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Yosef ha'Bavli holds that a Zav who is Mechusar Kipurim is like a Zav. The first Tana holds that he is not like a Zav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all agree that he is not like a Zav;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue about "v'Hizah ha'Tahor", which teaches that even one who is (partially) Tamei (i.e. Tevul Yom) is Kosher for the Parah Adumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The first Tana holds that this refers to (Tevul Yom of) all Tum'os;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Yosef ha'Bavli says that it only refers to (Tevul Yom of) the Tum'ah of this Parshah, i.e. Tum'as Mes (or lighter Tum'os);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Zav is more stringent, for the Tum'ah emanates from the person himself.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MECHUSAR BEGADIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Mechusar Begadim (is Mechalel Avodah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avuha):</span> "V'Chagarta Osam Avnet Aharon u'Vanav... Migva'os v'Haysah Lahem Kehunah l'Chukas Olam" - they are Kohanim only when their clothes are on them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learn from a different verse!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that Shtuyei Yayin (a Kohen who drank wine) is Mechalel Avodah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yayin v'Shechar Al Tesht... u'Lehavdil Bein ha'Kodesh u'Vein ha'Chol" (Avodah done while drunk is Chol (profane)).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Mechusar Begadim or one who did not wash his hands and feet is Mechalel Avodah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Chukah-Chukah".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From there, we would know only Avodos for which a Zar is Chayav Misah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"V'Chagarta..." teaches all Avodos.</p></div>
