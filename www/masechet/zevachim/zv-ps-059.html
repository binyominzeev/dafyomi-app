<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE LOCATION OF THE <i>MIZBE'ACH</i> (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (of R. Zeira - Rav Sharbiya):</span> (Indeed, the four Amos include the Yesod and Sovev.) Mishnah #1 is like R. Yosi ha'Galili;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Galili):</span> We must put the Kiyor (fountain from which the Kohanim wash) "Bein Ohel Mo'ed u'Vein ha'Mizbe'ach." However, the Mizbe'ach must be "Sham Pesach Mishkan Ohel Mo'ed" (verse 29 - Rashi; Shitah Mekubetzes - "Lifnei Pesach Mishkan Ohel Mo'ed", verse 6). The Kiyor cannot be in front of the opening (lest it separate between the opening and the Mizbe'ach)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Therefore, the Kiyor is between the Ulam and the Mizbe'ach, a bit south of the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where does R. Yosi ha'Glili hold that the Mizbe'ach was? (If the Mizbe'ach extended further south than Pesach ha'Heichal, we could put the Kiyor between the Mizbe'ach and the wall of the Heichal, and it would not face the opening. We would ideally fulfill "Bein Ohel Mo'ed u'Vein ha'Mizbe'ach." What forced him to say that it was south of the Mizbe'ach?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Mizbe'ach is entirely in Darom, we could put the Kiyor south of Pesach ha'Heichal, between the Heichal and the Mizbe'ach (even if it is even with Pesach ha'Ulam)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Even if the Ulam has Kedushas Heichal (so the Kiyor may not face Pesach ha'Ulam), the Kiyor could be placed south of the opening of the Ulam, (Shitah Mekubetzes - between the Heichal and the Mizbe'ach, even with) between the Ulam and the Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Likewise, if the Mizbe'ach is centered, 11 Amos of the Mizbe'ach extend south of the Pesach ha'Heichal. The Kiyor could be placed there, between the Heichal and the Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Even if the Ulam has Kedushas Heichal, six Amos of the Mizbe'ach extend south of the Pesach ha'Ulam. The Kiyor could be placed there, (Shitah Mekubetzes - even with) between the Ulam and the Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that the Mizbe'ach is entirely in Tzafon. (Therefore, the Kiyor must be south of the Mizbe'ach, so it will face the opening.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should put the Kiyor (between the Mizbe'ach and the wall of the Heichal,) north of the opening of the Heichal!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that the Ulam has Kedushas Heichal. The Kiyor would separate between the opening of the Ulam and the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should put the Kiyor north of the opening of the Ulam!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Tzafonah" - the north of the Azarah must be empty of Kelim (except for those needed for Shechitah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana that argues with R. Yosi ha'Galili (and R. Yehudah), and says that the Mizbe'ach is entirely in Darom?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Eliezer ben Yakov;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> "Tzafonah" - the north must be empty of everything. Even the Mizbe'ach may not be there.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>IF THE <i>MIZBE'ACH</i> BECAME DISQUALIFIED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If Korbanos were slaughtered and then the Mizbe'ach became dented (Birkas ha'Zevach; Panim Me'iros - they were slaughtered when the Mizbe'ach was dented), they are Pesulim (even if the Mizbe'ach was later fixed);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A verse teaches this, but I do not remember it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon bar Rebbi):</span> Korbanos slaughtered (before; Panim Me'iros - when) the Mizbe'ach became (was) dented are Pesulim - "v'Zovachta Alav Es Olosecha v'Es Shelamecha";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> <i>Must</i> Korbanos be slaughtered <i>on</i> the Mizbe'ach?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that (they must be slaughtered for the sake of putting their blood and Eimurim on the Mizbe'ach, and) the Mizbe'ach must be complete.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Kahana:</span> Surely, this is the verse that Rav forgot!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even if a Korban was slaughtered after the Mizbe'ach was fixed, it is Pasul (if it was Kodesh when the Mizbe'ach was broken).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan holds that Ba'alei Chayim Nidchim (if a living animal become disqualified (from being offered), it is permanently Pasul). Rav holds that Ba'alei Chayim are not Nidchim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Beraisa):</span> Anything that was Kodesh before the Mizbe'ach was built, it is Pasul after the Mizbe'ach is built.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If it was Kodesh before the Mizbe'ach was built, it was Dachuy me'Ikarah (from the beginning! Rashi - we never resolved whether such Dichuy takes effect. This Beraisa should have concluded the argument! Tosfos - all agree that such Dichuy does not take effect, for people can fix it, i.e. they can build the Mizbe'ach!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, anything Kodesh before the Mizbe'ach was destroyed (by Nebuchadnetzar), was Pasul after the Mizbe'ach was rebuilt (in the days of Ezra).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> (There were 70 years in between.) Even if the animal lived, it is Pasul due to age!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, anything Kodesh before the Mizbe'ach was dented (i.e. disqualified) is Pasul after the Mizbe'ach is fixed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In any case, we must alter the text of the Beraisa. Rav can correct it to say 'any Korban slaughtered before (or when) the Mizbe'ach was dented is Pasul after the Mizbe'ach is fixed.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Gidal cited Rav to say that if the Mizbe'ach was uprooted from its place (which disqualifies it), we may offer Ketores in its place! (Above (a), Rav disqualified Korbanos due to a dent in the Mizbe'ach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We can answer similar to Rava's teaching:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> R. Yehudah (says that the floor of the Azarah has Kedushas Mizbe'ach in many respects, but he) admits about blood. (It must be thrown on the Mizbe'ach, and not on the floor.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Similarly, Rav admits that animal Korbanos are Kosher only if the Mizbe'ach is valid at the time.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MAY <i>KORBANOS</i> BE OFFERED ON THE FLOOR?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was R. Yehudah's teaching?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Ba'Yom ha'Hu Kidash ha'Melech Es Toch he'Chatzer... Ki Mizbach ha'Nechoshes Katon me'Hachil" - the simple understanding is correct. (Since Shlomo's stone Mizbe'ach (in place of Moshe's copper Mizbe'ach) was too small for all the Korbanos of the day of Chanukas Beis ha'Mikdash, Shlomo was Mekadesh the floor.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> Surely, Shlomo's Mizbe'ach was big enough for the Korbanos!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">59b----------------------------------------59b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Elef Olos Ya'aleh Shlomo Al ha'Mizbe'ach ha'Hu" (he would offer 1000 Olos in a day on Mizbe'ach ha'Nechoshes. The fire was only one square Amah, and it consumed 1000 entire animals);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In the Beis ha'Mikdash, "va'Yizbach Shlomo Es Zevach ha'Shelamim... Bakar Esrim u'Shnayim Elef...";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Shlomo's Mizbe'ach (had 400 square Amos for the fire. Surely it) sufficed to burn the Eimurim (only the Chelev of Shelamim is burned) of all these Korbanos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say "Katon me'Hachil"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a polite way of saying why Moshe's Mizbe'ach was replaced (even though the 'excuse' is not true).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can R. Yehudah answer R. Yosi?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah expounds that Moshe's Mizbe'ach was larger than what the verse says explicitly:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> "Chamesh Amos Orech v'Chamesh Amos Rochav" - the simple understanding is correct. (Moshe's Mizbe'ach was five Amos by five Amos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> It says here "Ravu'a", like it says in Yechezkeil's prophecy (of the Mizbe'ach of Bayis Sheni);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Just like there the measure given is from the center (the area for the fire extends 12 Amos outwards in all four directions) also here.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that Yechezkeil gives the measure from the center?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Veha'Ari'el Shteim Esreh (Orech...)" - in each (of the four) directions (out from the center).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps its length and width are each 12!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Rejection "El Arba'as Reva'av" teaches that this is in each (of the four) directions.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Yosi holds that the Gezerah Shavah teaches about the height of Mizbe'ach ha'Nechoshes.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "V'Shalosh Amos Komaso" - the simple understanding is correct (it was three Amos tall).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> It says here "Ravu'a", like it says regarding Mizbe'ach ha'Zahav;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Just like there the height (two Amos) was twice the length, also here (it was 10 Amos tall, twice the length).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> The curtains surrounding Chatzer ha'Mishkan were only five Amos tall. If the Mizbe'ach was taller, people could see the Avodah from the outside! (This is unreasonable.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) R. Yosi:</span> It says "v'Es Kal'ei he'Chatzer v'Es Masach Pesach Sha'ar he'Chatzer Asher Al ha'Mishkan v'Al ha'Mizbe'ach" - just like the Mishkan (was 10 Amos tall, and) must be surrounded by curtains (i.e. those around Chatzer ha'Mishkan) (at least) 10 Amos tall, also the Mizbe'ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It also says "Kela'im Chamesh Esre Amah El ha'Kasef" (they were 15 Amos tall. Tosfos' text does not learn this from a verse.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Another verse says "v'Komah Chamesh Amos"!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are five Amos taller than the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
