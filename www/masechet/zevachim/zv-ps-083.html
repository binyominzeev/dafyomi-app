<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHEN IS THE BLOOD DISQUALIFIED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If blood was brought in Lechaper...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> It says here "Lechaper ba'Kodesh", and it says that no one else may be in the Ohel Mo'ed on Yom Kipur when the Kohen Gadol enters "Lechaper ba'Kodesh";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like there, the Isur begins once the Kohen Gadol enters, even before Kaparah, also here the blood is Pasul once it enters, even before Kaparah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Shimon says, it says here "Lechaper ba'Kodesh", and it says to burn the Par and Sa'ir of Yom Kipur whose blood was brought in "Lechaper ba'Kodesh";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like there, this refers to after Kaparah, also here.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer holds that it is better to learn (about blood, which should be left) outside from (people who are commanded to stay) outside, and not from the Kaparah of Yom Kipur which is done inside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon holds that it is better to learn about (the blood of) an animal from (the blood of) an animal, and not from a law about people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> (If it was entered b'Shogeg, it is Kosher.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If it was entered b'Mezid, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does this apply when he was Mechaper (like R. Shimon), or even before Kaparah (like R. Eliezer)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah - Beraisa):</span> It says "v'Es Par ha'Chatas v'Es Se'ir ha'Chatas...";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "veha'Soref..."?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Clearly, the verse teaches that the one who burns them is Metamei Begadim! (He and the clothes he is wearing at the time become Teme'im.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We ask why it says "ha'Chatas" twice.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah):</span> This teaches that all Chata'os that should be burned (i.e. inner Chata'os) are Metamei Begadim (of those who burn them).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (R. Meir):</span> We already know that from "Lechaper" (that all Korbanos brought inside for Kaparah are Metamei Begadim)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't R. Yehudah learn like R. Meir?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and summation of Answer (i)):</span> R. Yehudah uses "Lechaper" for the Gezerah Shavah (of R. Shimon. This shows that he holds like R. Shimon.)</p></div>
<div class="perekline"><p>PEREK HA'MIZBE'ACH MEKADESH</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE <i>MIZBE'ACH</i> IS <i>MEKADESH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Mizbe'ach is Mekadesh what is proper for it (like we will explain):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehoshua says, if any Kodesh proper for the fire (i.e. it is normally burned on the Mizbe'ach) was Alah (came up on the Mizbe'ach), Lo Yered (we do not take it down, even if it is Pasul) - "Hi ha'Olah Al Mokdah";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Olah is proper for the fire, and if it came up, Lo Yered. The same applies to all Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Gamliel says, any Kodshim proper for the Mizbe'ach that Alah, Lo Yered - "Hi ha'Olah Al Mokdah Al ha'Mizbe'ach";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Olah is proper for the Mizbe'ach, and if it came up, Lo Yered. The same applies to all Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>They argue only about blood and Nesachim (of wine or water). R. Gamliel says Lo Yerdu (since they are offered on the Mizbe'ach), and R. Yehoshua says Yerdu (since they are not burned).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Shimon says, (when Nesachim accompany a Korban), whether (only) the Nesachim or Korban or both are Pesulim, we do not take down the Korban, but we take down the Nesachim.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> This excludes a Kemitzah that was not put into a Kli Shares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Why is this different than Ula's law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> If Eimurim of Kodshim Kalim Alu before Zerikah, Lo Yerdu, for they became 'food' of the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Eimurim are not taken down, for they are not lacking anything;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that if meat (of an Olah) flies off the Mizbe'ach (due to the fire), we must return it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehoshua's source of this law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from "Asher Tochal ha'Esh".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Gamliel uses this to teach that meat of an Olah is returned to the fire, but Ketores is not.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehoshua says, it teaches both (meat of an Olah is returned, but Ketores is not.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches <i>what</i> is Mekadesh what is proper for the fire, i.e. the Mizbe'ach is Mekadesh.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Gamliel says, since the Torah permits offering Pesulim, we do not distinguish whether or not it was ever proper.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva includes it from "Olah". R. Yosi ha'Galili excludes it from "Kevasim" (the Mizbe'ach is Mekadesh only Behemos).</p></div>
