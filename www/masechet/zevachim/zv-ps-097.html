<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHEN IS <i>MERIKAH U'SHTIFAH</i> DONE?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of Mishnah):</span> A spit or grill is Kashered in hot water.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is R. Tarfon's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "U'Fanisa va'Boker v'Halachta l'Ohalecha" - the Torah considers all the days of the festival to be like one.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Achdevoy bar Ami):</span> If so, Pigul and Nosar would not apply during the festival!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is true!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Noson):</span> R. Tarfon taught (that they are considered like one day) only regarding Merikah u'Shtifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Tarfon holds like Rav Nachman;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Cooking Kodshim in a pot purges the pot from absorptions of the previous day's Kodshim (before they become forbidden).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> Until the time the Kodshim are eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> He waits until they are eaten (Bartenura; Rambam - until the last time they are permitted; Tosfos - he waits the entire time they are permitted), and then does Merikah u'Shtifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan) Question:</span> Right after "u'Morak v'Shutaf", it says "Kol Zachar ba'Kohanim Yochal." Why are these adjacent to each other?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that Merikah u'Shtifah is after waiting (until) the time that they are (or may be) eaten.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHAT ARE <i>MERIKAH</i> AND <i>SHTIFAH</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Merikah is like rinsing a cup (from the inside). Shtifah is like rinsing a cup (from the outside).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Merikah and Shtifah are in cold water;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Chachamim say, Merikah is in hot water, and Shtifah is in cold water.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We find that hot water was needed to Kasher Kelim of Nochrim (i.e. after the war with Midyan.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rebbi agrees that Kashering requires hot water. Merikah u'Shtifah is after this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim say, if cold water were used for both, the Torah would have used (forms of) the same word twice, i.e. 'Morak Murak' or Shotaf Shutaf';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Torah used different words to teach that they are different. Merikah is in hot water, and Shtifah is in cold water.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rebbi says, had the Torah used the same word twice, we would have thought that the same action is done twice;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It used different words to teach that they are different. Merikah is from the inside, and Shtifah is from the outside.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ABSORPTIONS OF <i>KODSHIM</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Kodshim and Chulin were cooked in the same pot, or Kodshei Kodoshim and Kodshim Kalim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it (the more severe Kedushah) is Nosen Ta'am (gives taste, in the lighter Kedushah), the lighter is eaten like the more severe;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Merikah u'Shtifah is not required. It does not disqualify anything it touches (these will be explained.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If a wafer touched a wafer, or a piece (of meat) touched a piece, it does not forbid all of them. It forbids only the place it touched.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does this mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Answer (text of Bartenura - the Mishnah is abbreviated, it means as follows);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is Nosen Ta'am, the lighter is eaten like the more severe. Merikah u'Shtifah is required, and it disqualifies anything it touches;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it is not Nosen Ta'am, the lighter is not eaten like the more severe. Merikah u'Shtifah is not required, and it does not disqualify what it touches.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (When Kodshei Kodoshim were not Nosen Ta'am to Kodshim Kalim) granted, the Kodshim Kalim do not need Merikah u'Shtifah like (i.e. according to the time of) Kodshei Kodoshim, but Merikah u'Shtifah is required like Kodshim Kalim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Indeed, the Mishnah means that Merikah u'Shtifah like Kodshei Kodoshim is not required, but Merikah u'Shtifah like Kodshim Kalim is required.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Mishnah is R. Shimon, who says that Kodshim Kalim do not require Merikah u'Shtifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rava, we understand why the Mishnah also teaches about cooking different Kodshim together (in order that a Stam Mishnah will be like R. Shimon);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to Abaye, what do we learn from this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must teach both cases;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it taught only Kodshim and Chulin, one might have thought that Chulin can Mevatel Kodshim, for they are not Mino, but different kinds of Kodshim cannot Mevatel each other;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it taught only Kodshei Kodoshim and Kodshim Kalim, one might have thought that only Kodshim have the strength to be Mevatel Kodshim, but Chulin cannot be Mevatel Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a wafer touched a wafer (or a piece (of meat) touched a piece...)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Kol Asher Yiga" teaches that it forbids even if it nothing was absorbed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Bi'Vsarah" teaches that this is only if taste was absorbed into the meat.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">97b----------------------------------------97b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps if it touched part of a piece, the entire piece is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Yiga" - only what touched is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The part that absorbed is cut off (and the rest is permitted.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>"Bi'Vsarah" - touching sinews, bones, horns or hooves does not forbid;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>"Yikdash" - what touches Kodshim becomes like the Kodshim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Kodshim is Pasul, the touched food is Pasul. If the Kodshim is Kosher, the touched food is eaten with the stringencies of the Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Kodshim became forbidden through touching Pasul Kodshim, the Mitzvas Aseh to eat Kodshim should override the Lav (of eating (something that absorbed) Pasul Kodshim!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> An Aseh does not override a Lav pertaining to the Mikdash:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Menasiya):</span> "V'Etzem Lo Sishberu Vo" - bones (of Korban Pesach) with or without marrow may not be broken.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (To eat marrow, one must break the bone.) The Aseh to eat the meat (which includes marrow) should override the Lav!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that an Aseh does not override a Lav of the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> "Yikdash" is an Aseh (to treat what touches Kodshim like the Kodshim. Eating food that absorbed Pasul Kodshim violates this Aseh.) The Aseh to eat Kodshim does not override a Lav and an Aseh.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p><i>KODSHEI KODOSHIM</i> ARE EQUATED TO EACH OTHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse teaches about food that touched Chatas. What is the source if it touched other Kodshim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel citing R. Eliezer):</span> "Zos ha'Torah la'Olah la'Minchah vela'Chatas vela'Asham vela'Milu'im ul'Zevach ha'Shelamim" (equates all these Korbanos to each other. The Gemara explains the verse in order. The answer to the question is at the top of Daf 98a.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"La'Olah" - all are like Olah, so a Kli (Shares) is required.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Kli is required?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Mizrak (bucket) is required for Kabalah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We would not need a Hekesh to Olah for this. We could learn from "ul'Zevach ha'Shelamim", which refers to Shalmei Tzibur (the entire verse discusses Kodshei Kodoshim). We know that a Kli is needed for them - "va'Yikach Moshe Chatzi ha'Dam va'Yasem ba'Aganos"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A knife is required for Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Va'Yishlach Avraham Es Yado va'Yikach Es ha'Ma'acheles" - he used the knife for an Olah, "va'Ya'alehu l'Olah Tachas Beno."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>"La'Minchah" - are all like Minchah, which only male Kohanim may eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which of them must be learned from Minchah?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn Chatas and Asham from Minchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It explicitly says about Chatas and Asham "Kol Zachar ba'Kohanim Yochalenu"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn Shalmei Tzibur from Minchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A different verse teaches this!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"B'Kodesh ha'Kodoshim Tochalenu Kol Zachar Yochal Oso" teaches that only male Kohanim may eat Shalmei Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer learns from the Hekesh to Minchah. Other Tana'im learn from that verse. (The Gemara did not say that the latter Drashah is a Beraisa, but it is in Yalkut Shimoni Tzav 509.)</p></div>
