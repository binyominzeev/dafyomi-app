<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question 3:a 106a - R. Yochanan):</span> We learn the Azharah for Shechutei Chutz from a Gezerah Shavah "Hava'ah-Hava'ah" from Ha'alas Chutz:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like there the Torah did not give an Onesh of Kares without an Azharah, also here (Shechutei Chutz.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rava citing R. Yonah):</span> We learn from a Hekesh to Ha'alas Chutz:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "Sham Ta'aleh Olosecha v'Sham Ta'aseh" (Devarim 12:14) - just like there the Torah did not give an Onesh of Kares without an Azharah, also here.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We brought a Lav for Ha'alas Chutz of Korbanos that (were slaughtered inside the Mikdash, hence) could have been offered inside and were offered outside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>What is the Lav for Korbanos that were slaughtered (outside, in order) to be offered outside, and were offered outside?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Kahana):</span> We read "va'Aleihem Tomar..." (at the beginning of the Parshah of Ha'alas Chutz) as if it were written va'Aleihem with an Ayin (in addition to them), i.e. it is a continuation of the previous Parshah, which discusses Shechutei Chutz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rabah):</span> "Va'Aleihem" is written (Shitah Mekubetzes - and read) with an Aleph (tell to them, i.e. Bnei Yisrael). It is not a continuation of the previous Parshah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We learn like Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Va'Aleihem Tomar..." - the 'Vov' connects the Parshiyos (the latter is a continuation of the former.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Hava'ah-Hava'ah" from Shechutei Chutz, that the Lav of Ha'alas Chutz applies also to Korbanos slaughtered outside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (to all these answers - Rav Bivi - Mishnah):</span> There are 36 Chayavei Kerisus. (If all were done in one Helam (forgetting), one is liable for all of them);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If we learn from a Hekesh or Gezerah Shavah, this is like a second Lav. The two cases of Ha'alas Chutz should be counted separately (for one is liable for each of them), making 37 in all!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who throws some of the blood outside is liable.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answers (Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> "Dam Yechashev (...Dam Shofach)" includes ha'Zorek;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva says, "<i>Oh</i> Zovach" includes ha'Zorek.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yishmael learn from "(Olah) <i>Oh</i> Zovach"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah had to say "Oh (or)." Had it connected them with a 'Vov', one might have thought that one is not liable unless he slaughters two Korbanos outside, a bird <i>and</i> an animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Akiva holds that "Lo <i>Yevi'enu</i>" (singular) obligates for one Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Yishmael holds that that exempts for a Chaser (incomplete Korban or Haktarah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>R. Akiva learns this from "La'asos Oso."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>R. Yishmael holds that these two exemptions are for Chaser, when the Shechitah was inside and when it was outside.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Akiva uses this to teach that one is liable for Shechitah, but not for Melikah b'Chutz.</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that one is liable for Melikah b'Chutz!

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Zeh ha'Davar" (this (Shechitah) is the only way one is liable.)</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from Zerikah, for a Zar who does Zerikah is Chayav Misah. (A Zar is not Chayav for Kemitzah or Kabalah, since they are not final Avodos.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">107b----------------------------------------107b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from a Tzad ha'Shavah of Shechitah and Zerikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If we could learn Chiyuvim for Avodah b'Chutz in this way, the Torah would not have taught the Chiyuv for Zerikah, for we could learn from a Tzad ha'Shavah of Shechitah and Ha'alah:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be able to learn (Zerikah) from Shechitah (alone)!</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, there is no refutation of the Tzad ha'Shavah. The fact that the Torah taught Zerikah anyway shows that we do not learn Chiyuvim for Avodah b'Chutz in this way.</p></div>
