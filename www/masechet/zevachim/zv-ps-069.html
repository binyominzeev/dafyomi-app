<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p><i>MELIKAH PESULAH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> The general rule is, Melikah of <i>any</i> Pesul b'Kodesh is Metaher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to R. Yochanan, this comes to include a Zar. According to Rav what does it include?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> What does 'if the Pesul was not b'Kodesh, it is not Metaher' include?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions):</span> 'Any Pesul b'Kodesh' includes Shechitah of Kodshim (birds) in the Mikdash. 'If the Pesul was not b'Kodesh' includes Melikah of Chulin outside the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> Melikah of a Zar, or of a Pasul, Pigul, Nosar and Tamei are not Metamei b'Veis ha'Beli'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yitzchak:</span> I heard that that either Kemitzah <i>or</i> Melikah of a Zar (if brought up the ramp) is taken down, but not the other. I do not know which is taken down.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Chizkiyah:</span> Presumably, Kemitzah of a Zar is taken down, but Melikah is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference? Presumably, Melikah is not taken down because a Zar is Kosher for Avodah on a Bamah. The same applies to Kemitzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> (He holds that) Menachos are not brought on a Bamah (therefore, we do not learn to Kemitzah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, he holds that also birds are not brought on a Bamah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> According to the opinion that Menachos may be brought on a Bamah, also birds may be brought on a Bamah. According to the opinion that Menachos are not brought on a Bamah, also birds are not brought.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "(Va'Yizbechu) Zevachim" excludes Menachos, and also birds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since a Minchah brought on a Bamah is not Mekudash in a Kli Shares, we do not learn from there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he did Melikah with the left hand or at night...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps (a bird killed through) Melikah inside (the Mikdash) is Metamei b'Veis ha'Beli'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (A bird that is) "Neveilah (is Metamei b'Veis ha'Beli'ah)."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That was the suggestion, that Melikah is Neveilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, we learn from "Treifah" (in that same verse). Just like Treifos (an injury that will cause the bird to die) does not permit anything, also Neveilah (that is Metamei) is when the death did not permit anything;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Melikah inside permits the bird (to Kohanim or the Mizbe'ach), so it is not Metamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Melikas Kodshim outside and Melikas Chulin inside or outside do not permit anything, so they are Metamei.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN IS THERE <i>TUM'AS BEIS HA'BELI'AH</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps a Chulin bird slaughtered inside, or a Kodesh bird slaughtered inside or outside is Metamei (b'Veis ha'Beli'ah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Neveilah".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That was the suggestion, that (Pasul) Shechitah is Neveilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, we learn from "Treifah." Neveilah is Metamei only if it is like Treifah, i.e. it is forbidden inside and outside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This excludes (Shechitah of) Chulin inside and Kodshim inside or outside, in which inside and outside are not the same (like we will explain). They are not Metamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, Chulin inside is forbidden, whereas Chulin outside is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, Kodshim (birds that were slaughtered) are Pesulim inside and outside!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Partial) Answer (Rava):</span> Since Shechitah of Kodshim outside is (considered Shechitah) to obligate Kares, it is considered Shechitah to inhibit Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This answers for Kodshim outside. How can we answer for Kodshim inside?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the law outside (there is Kares) is different than inside, the verse teaches that Tum'as Beis ha'Beli'ah does not apply. (Alternatively - they cannot be Teme'im inside, for then inside and outside would not be the same!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Melikah of Kodshim outside should not be Metamei, for it is different than Melikah inside (the latter is Tahor)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Simi bar Ashi):</span> We learn the improper from the improper (e.g. Shechitah of Kodshim inside from outside, or Shechitah of Chulin inside from Shechitah of a Treifah outside);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We do not learn the improper from the proper (e.g. Melikas Kodshim outside from Melikas Kodshim inside).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We (sometimes) learn improper from proper!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Yotzei (Eimurim that left the Mikdash), were brought back and up the ramp, we do not take them down, because Yotzei is Kosher on a Bamah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, the Tana relies on "Zos Toras ha'Olah."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DOES A SLAUGHTERED <i>TREIFAH</i> HAVE <i>TUM'AS BEIS HA'BELI'AH</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If after Melikah the bird was found to be Treifah, it is not Metamei (b'Veis ha'Beli'ah);</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">69b----------------------------------------69b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it is Metamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> Nivlas Behemah has Tum'as Maga (through touching) and Tum'as Masa (through moving), yet Shechitah is Metaher a Treifah Behemah (from becoming Neveilah). Nivlas Of has neither Tum'as Maga nor Masa, all the more so Shechitah should be Metaher a Treifah bird!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We find that Shechitah permits eating, and it is Metaher Treifos. Likewise, Melikah permits eating. Also it should be Metaher Treifos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> Dayo (a Kal va'Chomer cannot teach more than either of the cases it is built on);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Your Kal va'Chomer learns from Nivlas Behemah, which becomes permitted through Shechitah. It cannot teach about Melikah, which does not permit Behemos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> R. Meir should agree to the principle of Dayo. It is mid'Oraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The source for Kal va'Chomer - is "v'Aviha Yarok Yarak b'Faneha ha'Lo Sikalem Shiv'as Yamim" - all the more so, if Hash-m is angry at her (Miryam), she should be shut up 14 days! (R. Tam - Hash-m makes as many contributions to a baby (10) as both parents together; R. Chayim - she should be shut up more than for a parent, and we find regarding Metzora that the Torah requires quarantine for a whole number of weeks!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We would have said so, but due to Dayo, we only learn as much as the source (i.e. seven days.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi bar Avin):</span> He agrees with the principle. Here he learns from a verse:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Zos Toras ha'Behemah veha'Of" - regarding what law are animals equated to birds?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Their Tum'os are different. A Behemah has Tum'as Maga and Masa, but not Tum'as Beis ha'Beli'ah. An Of has Tum'as Beis ha'Beli'ah but neither Maga nor Masa!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Just like what permits eating a Behemah (Shechitah) is Metaher (Behemos) Treifos, likewise, what permits eating birds (Melikah) is Metaher (Ofos) Treifos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Yehudah argue with R. Meir?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He expounds a verse:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Neveilah u'Treifah" - why did the Torah need to mention Treifah? (Mortal injuries or defects are called 'Tereifah'. One opinion says that sometimes, a Tereifah can live.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> If a Treifah can live, it will become a Neveilah when it dies;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If a Treifah cannot live, it is already (and will never cease to be) Neveilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah teaches that a Treifah can live, and that (Rashi; Rashi Kesav Yad - it teaches that even if a Treifah can live,) it becomes a Neveilah when it dies, even if it is slaughtered.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> If the verse refers to meat taken from a living Treifah, it is Neveilah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If it refers to meat of a dead Treifah, it is Neveilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah teaches that even if a Treifah was slaughtered, it becomes Neveilah. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shizbi):</span> Similarly, we can ask about "v'Chelev Neveilah v'Chelev <i>Treifah</i> (is Tahor)"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> If a Treifah can live, it will become a Neveilah when it dies. If not, it is already Neveilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> Whether the verse refers to meat taken from a living or dead Treifah, it is Neveilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We must say that it teaches that Chelev of a slaughtered Treifah is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This implies that the animal itself is Tamei! (Rav Yehudah taught otherwise.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "V'Chi Yamus <i>Min</i> ha'Behemah" - some Behemos become Tamei when they die, and others do not;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The latter refers to a slaughtered Treifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Rather, "Treifah" (regarding Chelev) excludes Tamei animals, in which there is no concept of Treifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Likewise, "Treifah" (regarding Nivlas Of) should exclude Tamei birds!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah excludes Tamei birds from "Neveilah":</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Nivlas Of Tamei has Tum'as Beis ha'Beli'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rejection "Neveilah u'Treifah Lo Yochal" refers to birds forbidden due to Neveilah, but not to Tamei birds that are forbidden only due to eating a Tamei species.</p></div>
