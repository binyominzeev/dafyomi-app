<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Eliezer should permit putting the inner blood, and then the outer blood (regarding most Korbanos, which are not disqualified when their blood enters the Heichal)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Indeed, he permits this.) Since this may not be done for all Korbanos (it disqualifies Chatas and Asham), the Mishnah does not mention it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> (If blood of any Korban entered the Heichal, it is Pasul.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A parable for this is a Talmid who mixed wine with warm water for his Rebbi. The Rebbi asked him to mix (more). The Talmid asked 'with what'? The Rebbi answered 'we are discussing warm water. Had I kept quiet, you would have known to mix with warm water;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Now that I tell you, I permit even cold water.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Similarly, the Torah was discussing Chatas (before teaching the Pesul of blood that entered the Heichal). Had it not specified, we would have assumed that the Pesul applies only to Chatas;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>However, the Torah specified Chatas. This teaches that the Pesul applies to all Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Before this Pesul, the Torah taught that if any Kodshim were cooked in a metal Kli, it requires Merikah u'Shtifah (scouring and rinsing);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Therefore, the Torah mentioned Chatas regarding the Pesul of blood that entered the Heichal to teach that this applies only to Chatas!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The proper parable is to a Talmid who mixed wine with warm and cold water for his Rebbi. The Rebbi asked him to mix only with warm water.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rather, R. Akiva learns from "v'Chol":</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Akiva) Question:</span> "Chatas" teaches that if Dam Chatas entered the Heichal, it is Pasul. What is the source that this applies to all Kodshei Kodoshim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "<i>Kol</i> Chatas." (I.e. had the verse said 'Kol', we would add only Kodshim Kalim. In truth, it says "v'Chol".)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that this applies also to Kodshim Kalim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "<i>v</i>'Chol Chatas."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi ha'Galili:</span> You cannot include other Korbanos! Rather, "Chatas" teaches about an individual's Chatas (for before this, the Torah discussed Korbanos Yachid);</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this applies only to a female Chatas (i.e. of a commoner). What is the source to include a male?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We already included Chatas Tzibur, which is always a male!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Version #1 (Shitah Mekubetzes, according to our (and Rashi's) text) Answer: Chata'os Tzibur are always males. We need a separate source to teach about male Korbanos Yachid (e.g. Se'ir Nasi).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>Version #2 (text suggested by Tosfos) Correction: Rather, "Kol Chatas" teaches about a male;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Yosi ha'Galili):</span> The verse about Dam Chatas that entered the Heichal refers to an inner Chatas (its blood should be brought inside). If it became Pasul, it is burned in Beis ha'Birah (in the Azarah), and one who eats it transgresses a Lav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> What is your source to disqualify Dam Chatas that entered the Heichal?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi ha'Galili:</span> I learn from "Hen Lo Huva." (On the day the Mishkan was inaugurated, the Se'ir Rosh Chodesh was burned. Moshe asked why, for its blood did not enter the Heichal. This implies that had this happened, it would disqualify the Korban.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In Beraisa #1, R. Yosi ha'Galili addresses R. Akiva according to R. Akiva's reasoning;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Granted, you say that "v'Chol Chatas" teaches the Pesul of blood that entered the Heichal. However, you may learn from it only Chata'os.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the blood of a Chatas was received in two buckets, and one of them was brought outside (the Azarah), the remaining blood (inside) is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yosi ha'Galili says, if one of them was brought inside the Heichal, the remaining blood (outside the Heichal) is Kosher;</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE <i>KODESH HA'KODASHIM</i> IS ALSO <i>POSEL</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (Blood that is brought) "Penimah" (to the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim) is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for blood brought into the Heichal?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "El ha'Kodesh (Penimah - Shitah Mekubetzes deletes this)."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It would suffice to teach that blood brought into the Heichal is Pasul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> Either of these words ("ha'Kodesh" and "Penimah") could refer to the Heichal or the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim. Had the Torah written only one, we would have learned the smaller Chidush (the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Now that the Torah wrote both, we know that "ha'Kodesh" refers to the Heichal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We find a Tana who learns similarly regarding Toshav and Sachir (slaves of a Kohen. The Torah forbids them to eat Terumah);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Toshav" is a permanent slave (an Eved Ivri Nirtza. He serves until Yovel), and "Sachir" is a temporary slave (an Eved Ivri bought for six years).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It would suffice for the Torah to teach that a Toshav may not eat, even though he is acquired permanently, and all the more so a Sachir may not!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the Torah said only "Toshav", we would have assumed (the smaller Chidush,) that this refers to a temporary slave (but a permanent slave eats). Now that it also wrote "Sachir", this shows that "Toshav" refers to a permanent slave.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Your case is unlike Toshav and Sachir. They are different people. The Torah teaches about both of them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even though it could have explicitly said Nirtza, and we would have learned a temporary slave from a Kal va'Chomer, the Torah wrote both of them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, if blood is disqualified once it enters the Heichal, bringing it into the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim does not disqualify any more. The Torah taught a meaningless Halachah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> The Torah must teach that the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim disqualifies when the blood was brought in abnormally (not through the Heichal, rather, through windows or the roof).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> The Torah disqualifies blood that "Yuva" (will be brought inside). This connotes normal entrance!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> If one intends to bring blood into the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim, it is not disqualified (even after entering the Heichal) until it gets to the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim. Therefore, the Torah must teach that the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim disqualifies.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rava):</span> If blood of the Par Helam Davar (of the Tzibur) or of the Sa'ir brought for Helam Davar of idolatry was brought into the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since bringing it "El ha'Kodesh" (to the Heichal) does not disqualify (it must be brought in!), also bringing it "Penimah" (to the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim) does not disqualify;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, since it should not be brought there, it becomes Pasul?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rava):</span> If you will say that it becomes Pasul, if blood of the Par or Sa'ir of Yom Kipur was (properly) sprinkled between the staves of the Aron, taken out to the Heichal, and brought back into the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps it is not disqualified, for it must be brought into the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, since it should not be brought back after it was taken out, bringing it backj disqualifies it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #3 (Rava):</span> If you will say that it becomes Pasul, if the blood was (properly) sprinkled towards the Paroches, taken to the inner Mizbe'ach, and brought back towards the Paroches, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is not Nifsal, for it is essentially in the same place (it did not cross a boundary);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, since the Torah calls this 'Yetzi'ah', it may not be brought back 'in'?</p></div>
