<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> If the Kiyor does not contain enough water to be Mekadesh four Kohanim, it is invalid - "v'Rachatzu Mimenu Moshe v'Aharon u'Vanav."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One may be Mekadesh from any Keli Shares, whether or not it contains a Revi'is of water!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - Answer (Rav Ada bar Acha):</span> The case is, the Keli Shares was carved into the Kiyor (so the water comes from the Kiyor, which contains enough water to be Mekadesh four Kohanim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - Answer (Rav Ada bar Acha):</span> The case is, water was scooped into the Keli Shares from the Kiyor (so the water comes from a Keli (the Kiyor) that contains enough water).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Mimenu" (Rashi - we must be Mekadesh from the Kiyor, but not from other Kelim; Tosfos - we must be Mekadesh from the Kiyor or a Keli like it, i.e. that contains enough water)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yirchetzu" comes to include other Klei Shares (Tosfos - that do not have the proper amount, as long as the water was taken from a Keli with the proper amount).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should include also Chulin Kelim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> A Kal va'Chomer excludes them:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The base of the Kiyor was anointed (with anointing oil), yet one may not be Mekadesh from it. A Chulin Keli was not anointed at all, all the more so one may not be Mekadesh from it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that one may not be Mekadesh from the base?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yehudah) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one may be Mekadesh from the base, just like from the Kiyor itself!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Kiyor Nechoshes v'Chano Nechoshes" - the base is equated to the Kiyor only in one way, that both are made of copper.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Mari):</span> We cannot learn from the base, which it is not meant to hold anything, to Chulin Kelim, which are made to hold things!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "Mimenu" excludes Chulin Kelim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should exclude also other Klei Shares!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yirchetzu" includes other Klei Shares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we include Klei Shares and exclude Chulin Kelim, and not vice-versa?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Klei Shares must be anointed, like the Kiyor. Chulin Kelim need not be.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHICH WATER MAY BE USED FOR THE <i>KIYOR</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Anything that (if added to Mikveh water) can complete the required 40 Sa'im can complete the quantity needed for Kidush (i.e. enough to wash four Kohanim), but (in some cases) it does not complete a Revi'is (Rashi, Tosfos - for Netilas Yadayim; Ra'avad - for a Mikveh to immerse Kelim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is an example?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Soft mud (completes a Mikveh).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If a cow will bend and drink it, it completes a Revi'is!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If a cow will not bend and drink it, it does not complete a Mikveh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Small bugs in water (complete a Mikveh).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Even an entire Mikveh may be made of such bugs (if they are ground up)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> One may immerse in anything that originates from water.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Avdimi):</span> One may immerse in the eye of a big fish (after it dissolves).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> Various liquids (including fruit juice) can complete the quantity for a Mikveh if they are added to a complete Mikveh and then the same quantity is removed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Mikveh had exactly 40 Sa'im, and a Se'ah (of another liquid) was added and a Se'ah was removed, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah bar Shila):</span> This may be repeated until the majority of the Mikveh is other liquids.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - (Rav Papa):</span> If a Keli holding a Revi'is was carved into the wall of a Mikveh, needles (or other small Kelim) may be immersed in it, because its water came from a proper Mikveh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - (Rav Papa):</span> If a Revi'is of water was scooped into a Keli from a Mikveh, needles may be immersed in it, because its water came from a proper Mikveh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> Mikveh water may be used for the Kiyor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that running water is not needed. A Beraisa requires running water!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "(The innards of an Olah are rinsed) ba'Mayim", but not in wine or mixed wine. "Ba'Mayim" (in another verse) includes other water, and Kal va'Chomer water of the Kiyor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this Kal va'Chomer?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> All the more so one may rinse with running water (Rashi - which <i>may be used for</i> the Kiyor).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. Rather, all the more so one may rinse with water of the Kiyor, which is Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That is no reason to be proper for rinsing the innards!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(D'Vei Shmuel - Beraisa):</span> (The innards of an Olah are rinsed with) water that has no accompanying name. This excludes water of the Kiyor.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The suggestion was correct. We include running water, which is required for the Kiyor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about whether running water is required. R. Yirmeyah holds like the Tana that does not require this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Yishmael says that spring water is used for the Kiyor. Chachamim say that other water is used.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>AN AREL IS MECHALEL AVODAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An Arel is Mechalel Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> No verse of Chumash teaches this. A verse of Yechezkeil alludes to it - "Kol Ben Nechar Erel Lev v'Erel Basar Lo Yavo El Mikdashi."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches that he may not enter the Mikdash. What is the source that he is Mechalel Avodah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Lechalel Es Beisi."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Ben Nechar" literally refers to a Nochri!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, it would not need to say "Erel Lev (an uncircumcised heart, i.e. a Rasha)."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since it must say "Erel Lev", why does it say "Ben Nechar"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that his deeds are Nisnachru (estranged) from Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of a (standard) Arel (i.e. he was not circumcised)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "v'Erel Basar".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>The Torah needed to teach both.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it taught only Arel Basar, one might have thought that this is because he is despised (due to his foreskin), but Arel Lev is not Mechalel Avodah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it taught only Arel Lev, one might have thought that this is because he does not act l'Shem Hash-m, but an Arel Basar acts l'Shem Hash-m, and he is not Mechalel Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>TEME'IM ARE MECHALEL AVODAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Tamei (is Mechalel Avodah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ziknei Darom (Chachamim of the south)):</span> This refers only to one who is Tamei Sheretz (became Tamei through a rodent), but one who is Tamei Mes is not Mechalel Avodah. (We do not refer to a Tamei Mes on the seventh day of Taharah, since (if he completes his Taharah) he will be fully Tahor at night, so he is like a Tamei Sheretz.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since Tum'as Mes is permitted for Korbanos Tzibur (e.g. if most of Yisrael, the Kohanim or Klei Shares are Tamei Mes, we offer and eat Korban Pesach in Tum'ah) l'Chatchilah, if a Tamei Mes Kohen offered even a Korban Yachid, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Question:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that Tum'as Sheretz is permitted for Korbanos Tzibur!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Taharah from Tum'as Mes requires Haza'ah (sprinkling of water with ashes of the Parah Adumah) on days three and seven, yet Tum'as Mes is permitted for Korbanos Tzibur.

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Tam) Question:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that if one who is Tamei Sheretz offered even a Korban Yachid, it is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Taharah from Tum'as Mes requires Haza'ah on days three and seven, yet a Tamei Mes does not Mechalel Avodah. Taharah from Tum'as Sheretz does not require Haza'ah, all the more so Avodah of a Tamei Sheretz is Kosher! (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ziknei Darom hold that Kohanim, who effect Kaparah (through Zerikah), have the same law as those who get Kaparah (the owners of the Korbanos).

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Ziknei Darom's opinion about offering the Korban (Pesach) of Teme'im?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they say that we do not offer the Korban of a Tamei Sheretz, Tum'as Sheretz should be permitted to the Tzibur!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If (most of) the Tzibur has a Tum'ah (which does not emanate from one's body) that forces an individual to wait until Pesach Sheni, they offer Pesach (Rishon).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They must say that we offer the Korban (Pesach) of one who is Tamei Sheretz (since if he immerses during the day, at night he will be fully Tahor and able to eat it).</p></div>
