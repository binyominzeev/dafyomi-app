<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps if it was slaughtered l'Shem any Korban, it becomes that Korban!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Avin):</span> When a Korban that is eaten (e.g. Pesach) is Nidcheh (gets the law of a different Korban), it is Nidcheh to a Korban that is eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also Chatas and Asham are eaten!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, a Korban that anyone can eat is Nidcheh to a Korban that anyone can eat, but not to Korbanos that only Kohanim may eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Avin):</span> Kodshim Kalim are Nidchim to Kodshim Kalim, not to Kodshei Kodoshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yitzchak b'Rebbi Savrin):</span> (According to both answers), if it was slaughtered l'Shem Ma'aser, it should become Ma'aser!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What laws would result from this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It would not require Nesachim, and one who sells it would be lashed for "Lo Yiga'el".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ha'Asiri Yihyeh Kodesh" - the only way an animal can become Ma'aser is if it is the tenth (to leave the pen).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (According to Answer #2), if it was slaughtered l'Shem Bechor, it should become Bechor!!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What laws would result from this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It would not require Nesachim, and one would have to give it to a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn a Gezerah Shavah "Evrah-Evrah" from Ma'aser (just like it cannot become Ma'aser (even if slaughtered l'Shem Ma'aser, so to it cannot become a Bechor).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it was slaughtered l'Shem Temurah (to be in place of another animal (Korban)), it should become a Temurah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What laws would result from this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One would be lashed for doing this (and it would be forbidden to sell or redeem it - Shitah Mekubetzes deletes this from the text).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Hayah Hu u'Smuraso" - Temurah takes effect only when a Chulin animal is designated to be in place of a Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it was slaughtered l'Shem Todah, it should become a Todah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What law would result from this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One would have to bring bread with it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Pesach itself does not require bread, so all the more so a Mosar Pesach does not!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> A Pesach itself does not require Nesachim, but (you yourself say that) a Mosar Pesach is a Shelamim and requires Nesachim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, even a Mosar Todah does not require bread, so all the more so a Mosar of another Korban (e.g. Pesach) does not!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE SOURCES FOR <i>MOSAR HA'PESACH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yemar brei d'Rav Hillel):</span> How do we know that "v'Im Min ha'Tzon Korbano" discusses a Mosar Pesach? Perhaps it discusses a Mosar Asham!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "V'Im Min ha'Tzon" connotes a Korban that comes from all Tzon, i.e. sheep and goats (but an Asham is always a sheep).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Avin bar Chiya):</span> 'Min (from)' always excludes. How can Rava expound it to include (that the Korban must apply to all Tzon)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Mani):</span> Also here, it excludes females and animals above one year old.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chana Bagdata'ah):</span> You cannot say that the verse discusses Mosar Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "Im Kesev", and later "v'Im Ez." We already know that Pesach (and hence Mosar Pesach) comes from sheep and goats!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That teaches like the following.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Kesev" includes the tail of a lamb that is a Pesach. (It is included with the Eimurim, i.e. it is burned on the Mizbeach).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Im Kesev" includes a Pesach above one year and a Shelamim that comes with Pesach (Rashi, it is brought on Erev Pesach, for satiation before eating the Pesach; Tosfos - that results from a Pesach, e.g. Mosar Pesach within its first year);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>These are like Shelamim in all respects, i.e. the owner does Semichah, brings Nesachim with them, and waves the chest and foreleg.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"V'Im Ez" separates, to teach that the tail of a goat is not part of the Eimurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learn this from different verses!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel's father):</span> "V'Im Min ha'Tzon Korbano l'Zevach Shelamim" teaches that a Korban brought from Tzon (i.e. a Pesach) is a Shelamim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Mosar Pesach is offered like a Shelamim - "v'Zavachta Pesach... Tzon u'Vakar";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Korban Pesach cannot be Bakar. It is only from Tzon!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it teaches that Mosar Pesach becomes a Korban that can be (any, i.e. male or female) cattle or flock, i.e. Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The three verses teach about three kinds of Mosar Pesach (all become Shelamim):</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">9b----------------------------------------9b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is after its first year, and after Pesach passed (the same applies before Pesach);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is within its first year, and after Pesach passed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It is within its first year, before Pesach came. (E.g. a Pesach was lost, a second animal was Hukdash for Pesach, and the first Pesach was found. One is used for Pesach, and the other can be slaughtered like Shelamim even before the time to slaughter the Pesach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>The Torah must teach all three cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it taught only the first, one might have thought that only then it is a Shelamim, for it cannot be used for Pesach at all; but not within its first year after Pesach, for it is still usable for Pesach Sheni;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it taught only the first two cases, one might have thought that only then it is Shelamim, because it is unusable for Pesach Rishon; but not within its first year before Pesach, for then it is still usable for Pesach Rishon.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SHINUY IN A KORBAN CHATAS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav):</span> If a Chatas was slaughtered l'Shem the Chatas of Nachshon (in the inauguration of the Mishkan), it is Kosher - "Zos Toras ha'Chatas" - all Chata'os are considered the same.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Mesharshiya - Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> If any Minchah was Nikmetzes (a handful was taken to be burned on the Mizbeach) l'Shem a different Minchah, it is Kosher, and the owner was Yotzei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because Menachos are unlike Zevachim</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>A Minchah made in a Machavas (a shallow pan) is recognizably different (it is drier) than one made in a Marcheshes (a deep pan). A Chareivah (a Minchah without oil) is clearly different than one that is Belulah (kneaded with oil, therefore, intent for a different Minchah is nonsense, so it has no effect);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Shechitah, Kabalah and Zerikah are the same for all Zevachim. (Therefore, l'Shem a different Zevach is Shinuy Kodesh.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If Menachos were not recognizably different from each other, R. Shimon would agree (with Chachamim) that l'Shem a different Minchah disqualifies. They do not expound "Zos Toras ha'Minchah" to equate all Menachos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav):</span> If a Chatas was slaughtered to atone for Nachshon, it is Kosher, because the dead do not need Kaparah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he specify Nachshon (among all dead people)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches (by implication) that it would be Pasul if it were slaughtered for a living person similar to Nachshon, i.e. the Chatas he brings is not due to a transgression, e.g. a Nazir or Metzora.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Those Chata'os do not atone (rather, they permit him to eat Kodshim). They are like Olos! (If a Chatas was slaughtered to atone for someone who must bring an Olah, it is Kosher.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #3 (Rav):</span> If a Chatas was slaughtered to atone for someone liable to bring a Chatas like Nachshon, it is Kosher, because that is like an Olah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #4 (Rav):</span> If a Chatas was slaughtered l'Shem the Chatas of Nachshon, it is Pasul, because that is like an Olah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav discuss Shechitah l'Shem Chatas Nazir or Metzora?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He gave the first example of an individual's Chatas (that did not atone).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If a Chatas separated for eating Chelev was slaughtered to atone for eating blood or serving idolatry, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was slaughtered l'Shem Chatas Nazir or Metzora, it is Pasul, for these are like Olos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If a Chatas separated for eating Chelev was slaughtered to atone for entering the Mikdash b'Tum'ah or eating Kodshim b'Tum'ah, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since there is Kares for Tum'as Mikdash (just like for eating Chelev), it is Kosher?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, since a poor person can bring birds for Tum'as Mikdash (but not for Chelev), it is Pasul?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> Rava taught that in all cases (even if it was to atone for eating blood), it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Shachat Osah l'Chatas" - it must be slaughtered l'Shem the proper Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> According to you, what was Rava's question?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> He asked about Shinuy Ba'alim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven ate Chelev and his Chatas was slaughtered to atone for someone who ate blood or served idolatry, it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it was slaughtered l'Shem a Nazir or Metzora who must bring a Chatas, it is Kosher.</p></div>
