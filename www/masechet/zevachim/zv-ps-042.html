<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Reish Lakish - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> One Matanah can make Pigul in outer Korbanos (i.e. on the outer Mizbe'ach), but regarding inner Korbanos, which require a total of 43 Matanos (between the staves of the Aron, on the Paroches and inner Mizbe'ach, i.e. the Par and Sa'ir of Yom Kipur) or 11 Matanos (on the inner Mizbe'ach, i.e. Par Mashu'ach or Par He'elem Davar):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Whether he was Mefagel in the first, second or third (set of Matanos), the Korban is Pigul, and there is Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, Kares does not apply unless he was Mefagel in all the Matirim (Matanos).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> R. Meir obligates Kares even if he was Mefagel in the second or third set, even though Reish Lakish's explanation (all Matanos follow the initial intent) does not apply!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yitzchak bar Avin):</span> The case is, the blood spilled after each set of Matanos. Each time, a new animal was brought to finish the Avodah. He was Mefagel in Shechitah of the first, second or third animal. Shechitah is an entire Matir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why do Chachamim exempt from Kares?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Chachamim hold like R. Eliezer:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who offers outside the Mikdash a k'Zayis of any of the following is Chayav Kares:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>A Kometz, frankincense, Ketores, the Minchah of a Kohen or Kohen Gadol, Minchas Nesachim (a flour offering that accompanies an animal Korban).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer says, he is not liable until he offers it entirely. (Likewise, Pigul applies only if he was Mefagel all the animals needed to complete offering this Korban.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rava himself says that R. Eliezer admits regarding blood (that one is liable for offering part of it outside)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer and R. Shimon):</span> If the blood spilled after some of the Matanos, (those Matanos are valid. They are not repeated. A new animal is slaughtered,) we put the remaining Matanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The case is, he was explicitly Mefagel in the first and third (sets of Matanos), but he was silent during the second set;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that since he verbalized his intent (Chutz li'Zmano) in the third set, this shows that he always expresses his intent, so his silence during the second set shows that he was not Mefagel in it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that this is not so. We still say that his intent in the second set was like his previously expressed intent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> The Beraisa does not say that he was silent during the second set!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text) Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> The case is, he was explicitly Mefagel in the first, second and third sets (but not the fourth, i.e. the Shirayim; the Tana holds that they are Me'akev. Alternatively, the four Matanos on the Keranos of the inner Mizbe'ach are counted separately from the seven Matanos on Tiharo (its top or middle).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi in Menachos) Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> The case is, he was explicitly Mefagel in the first and second sets, but was silent during the third. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that since he verbalized his intent in the second (Version #1 - and third) set(s), this shows that he always expresses his intent, so his silence during the last set shows that he was not Mefagel in it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that this is not so. We still say that his intent in the last set was like his previously expressed intent.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> (If he was Mefagel in some sets of Matanos) the Korban is Pigul, and there is Kares.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Becoming Pigul is like becoming acceptable. A Korban does not become Pigul until finishing all the Avodos needed for a Kosher Korban to bring Kaparah (without any other Pesul).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Once he was Mefagel in one Matanah, the rest of the blood is Nifsal. Putting it on the Mizbe'ach is like putting water!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> He can Mefagel in any of the sets of Matanos (of the inner Chata'os of Yom Kipur) if (the blood spills after each set, and) a total of four Parim and four Se'irim are brought.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> It is possible even if only one Par and one Sa'ir are brought;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like when one is Mefagel in Shechitah, we consider the subsequent Zerikos to be proper (they were offered without any other Pesulim), the same applies when one is Mefagel in any of the 43 Matanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> There are 47 Matanos. (In the Beraisa, R. Meir said that there are 43.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is like the opinion that the blood of the Par is offered by itself on the four Keranos of the inner Mizbe'ach, and likewise, of the Sa'ir;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir holds that they are mixed together and put at once.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is like the opinion (that the blood of the Par and of the Sa'ir are offered by themselves on the Keranos, and) that the Shirayim are Me'akev. (Therefore, he counts the Shirayim.)</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> R. Meir is Mechayev Kares if he offered the Kometz silently and the frankincense with intent.

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, if he offered the Kometz silently <i>after</i> he offered the frankincense with intent.</p></div>
