<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> The days of Mashi'ach will be 40 years - "Arba'im Shanah Akut b'Dor";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Elazar ben Azaryah says, they will be 70 years - "...v'Nishkachas Tzur Shiv'im Shanah ki'Mei Melech Echad";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This refers to the special king, Mashi'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rebbi says, they will be three generations - "Yira'ucha Im Shemesh...Dor Dorim" (Dor teaches one, and Dorim teaches another two).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Hillel says, Yemos ha'Mashi'ach were already fulfilled in the days of Chizkiyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> May Hash-m pardon his mistake! Chizkiyah was in Bayis Rishon, and Zecharyah prophesized in the second Mikdash "Hinei Malkech Yavo"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> The days of Mashi'ach will be 40 years. It says here "va'Y'ancha va'Yar'ivecha", and it says "Samchenu ki'Mos Anisanu" (like the years of our affliction). Just like Yisrael were in the Midbar for 40 years, so will be Yemos ha'Mashi'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Dosa says, they will be 400 years. Yemos ha'Mashi'ach are equated to Galus Mitzrayim - "v'Inu Osam Arba Me'os Shanah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rebbi says, they will be 365 years, corresponding to the days of the year - "Yom Nokom b'Libi u'Shnas Ge'ulai Ba'ah."</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> Hash-m revealed the time of Mashi'ach to His heart, but not to the angels.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Avimi son of R. Avahu):</span> Yemos ha'Mashi'ach will be 7000 years for Yisrael - "u'Msos Chasan Al Kalah Ken Yasis Alayich Hash-m" (a Chasan rejoices seven days with his Kalah. Hash-m's day is 1000 years.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Yemos ha'Mashi'ach will last as long as the time from creation until Mashi'ach comes - "ki'Mei ha'Shamayim Al ha'Aretz."</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE REWARD AWAITING TZADIKIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Nevi'im prophesized about Yemos ha'Mashi'ach, but not about the world to come - "Ayin Lo Ra'asah Elokim Zulasecha Ya'aseh li'Mchakeh Lo."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He argues with Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The only difference between this world and Yemos ha'Mashi'ach is that the kingdoms will cease to rule over Yisrael. (The prophecies describe the world to come.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Nevi'im prophesized about the reward awaiting penitent sinners, but the reward of Tzadikim that never sinned "Ayin Lo Ra'asah..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>He argues with R. Avahu.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Penitent sinners have a greater share in the world to come than Tzadikim who never sinned. "Shalom Shalom la'Rachok vela'Karov" - the Rachok (far) is in front of the near;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>'Far' refers to one who was far from Hash-m (but repented). 'Near' refers to one who was always close.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan explains, 'far' is one who distanced himself from sin. 'Near' is one who was close to sin and distanced himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Nevi'im prophesized about the reward awaiting those who marry their daughters to Chachamim, do business with Chachamim and benefit Chachamim from their possessions, or penitent sinners, but the reward of Chachamim themselves "Ayin Lo Ra'asah..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "Ayin Lo Ra'asah..."?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> This is wine that has been guarded in the grape since the six days of creation (Chidushei Torah that were never revealed to any person).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who says that Torah was not given from Shamayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> "Ki Devar Hash-m Bazah..." is one who says that Hash-m did not give the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Alternatively, "Ki Devar Hash-m Bazah" is an Apikorus (this and the next opinion will be defined later).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Alternatively, "Ki Devar Hash-m Bazah" is Megaleh Panim ba'Torah;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>"Hikares" - in this world; "Tikares" - in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer ha.Moda'i says, one who desecrates Kodshim, disgraces the festivals (Rashi - Chol ha'Mo'ed; Rambam - Yom Tov), nullifies circumcision, is Megaleh Panim ba'Torah, or makes one blush in public (by embarrassing him), even if he has Torah and Mitzvos, he has no share in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> "Ki Devar Hash-m Bazah..." is one who says that Hash-m did not give the Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if he says that Hash-m gave the entire Torah except for one verse, which Moshe wrote on his own, or that Moshe decided that a certain word should be written missing a letter or with an extra letter, or that (a particular; Margoliyos ha'Yam - the principle of) Kal va'Chomer or Gezerah Shavah was not from Hash-m, this is considered "Devar Hash-m Bazah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> "Ki Devar Hash-m Bazah" is one who learns Torah and does not teach it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Noson says, this is one who belittles the importance of Mishnah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Nehurai says, this is one who could engage in Torah and does not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yishmael says, this is one who serves idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does he learn this from the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Devar Hash-m Bazah" - he is Mevazeh (disgraces) the Dibur (utterance) "Lo Yihyeh Lecha Elohim Acherim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Yehoshua ben Korchah says, one who learns Torah and does not review it is like one who sows and does not harvest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yehoshua says, one who learns Torah and forgets it is like a woman who bears children and buries them.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">99b----------------------------------------99b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Akiva says, if one constantly reviews his learning, he will remember it, like one remembers a song that he always sings.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi):</span> He learns from "Nefesh Amel Amlah Lo Ki Achaf Alav Pihu."</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Was he created to toil in Torah or in Sichah? (Ben Yehoyada - Sichah does not refers to conversation, rather, Tefilah. The question was whether one should toil to say every word, from the Akeidah until Aleinu, with great Kavanah, even though this will take many hours and little time will remain for Torah, like the Ba'al Shem Tov and Chasidim. Or, one should pray at a reasonable pace, in order that much time will remain for Torah, like the Gra and the Prushim (Misnagdim).)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Lo Yamush Sefer ha'Torah ha'Zeh mi'Picha" - he was created to toil in Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> All bodies were created to toil. Happy are those who toil in Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "No'ef Ishah Chasar Lev" is one who learns intermittently (like an adulterer who is not regular with one wife) - "Na'im Ki Sishmerem b'Vitnecha Yikonu Yachdav Al Sefasecha" (if one constantly learns, he will retain his Torah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Veha'Nefesh Asher Ta'aseh b'Yad Ramah" refers to Menasheh, who mocked the Torah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(He said) Moshe wrote things that do not teach anything, e.g. "va'Achos Lotan Timna v'Simna Haysah Filegesh le'Elifaz", and "va'Yelech Reuven bi'Mei Ketzir Chitim va'Yimtza Duda'im ba'Sadeh"!</p>

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Asi):</span> At first, the Yetzer ha'Ra is (thin) like a thread of Kuvya (a spider's web). In the end (after conceding to it many times), it is like ropes that draw the Agalah (wagon).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "va'Achos Lotan Timna"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It emphasizes that she was a princess - "Aluf Lotan" (many texts omit "Aluf Timna"; Ramah - the latter verse itself proves that she was like a queen).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Aluf' refers to an uncrowned king.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She wanted to convert. She went to Avraham, Yitzchak and Yakov, but they refused to accept her. She became a concubine to Elifaz the son of Esav. She reasoned that it is better to be a slave to the nation of Avraham and Yitzchak than to be a distinguished wife in another nation.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Her son was Amalek, the head of the nation that torments Yisrael. This was a punishment. The Avos should not have rejected her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rava b'Rebbi Yitzchak):</span> "Va'Yelech Reuven bi'Mei Ketzir Chitim" teaches that Tzadikim are careful to avoid theft. (He went after the harvest, when people do not mind others walking on their fields.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are Duda'im?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> They are Yavruchi (this is the Targum. Perhaps they are mandrakes. Rashi is unsure what they are.)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Alexandri):</span> One who learns Torah Lishmah (purely in order to understand it) creates Shalom above and below - "Oh Yachazik b'Ma'uzi Ya'aseh Shalom Li Shalom Ya'aseh Li";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> It is as if he built Heaven and earth - "va'Asim Devarai b'Ficha... Linto'a Shamayim v'Lisod Aretz";</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If one teaches Torah to another's son, the Torah considers it as if he made him - "v'Es ha'Nefesh Asher Asu v'Charan";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> It is as if he made the words of Torah - "va'Asisem Osam";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It is as if he made himself. We read "va'Asisem Osam" like 'va'Asisem Atem.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> If one induces another to do a Mitzvah, the Torah considers it as if he himself did it - "Asher Hikisa Bo Es ha'Ye'or."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Aharon struck the river. Moshe did not!</p>
