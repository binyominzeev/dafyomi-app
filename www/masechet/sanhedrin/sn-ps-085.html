<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May Beis Din appoint a son to be their Shali'ach to lash or curse (excommunicate) his father?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes):</span> Why is a stranger permitted to do this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that honoring Shamayim (by punishing sinners) overrides the Isur to hit or curse a Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> Likewise, it overrides the Isur to hit or curse a parent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Someone for whom it is a Mitzvah to hit him (lashes in Beis Din), one is commanded not to hit him (an extra lash). Someone for whom there is no Mitzvah to hit him, all the more so one is commanded not to hit him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> In both cases, the person is Chayav lashes. It is a Mitzvah for a stranger to hit him, but not for his son to hit him. (This is the warning against hitting a parent!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, we never distinguish (regarding lashes) between the son and a stranger;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa teaches, someone for whom it is a Mitzvah to hit (he is Chayav lashes), one is commanded not to hit him (extra). Someone for whom there is no Mitzvah to hit him (he is not Chayav lashes), and all the more so one is commanded not to hit him! (This is a general warning not to hit a Yisrael.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven was being taken to be executed, and his son hit or cursed him, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If someone else hit or cursed him, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the son and a stranger?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> The case is, they were insisting that Reuven go, he was refusing. (Beis Din may appoint a stranger to be their Shali'ach to hit or curse Reuven to make him go. They may not appoint his son.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rav Sheshes (who says that Beis Din may appoint a son to hit or curse his father) must establish this when they were not insisting that Reuven go.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why is a stranger exempt?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Once Reuven was sentenced, he is considered dead.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav Sheshes taught that if Levi was sleeping and Shimon embarrassed him, he is liable, even if Levi died without waking up (because his children are embarrassed. Here also, the stranger should be liable for embarrassment to Reuven's children!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The case is, the damage to Reuven was less than the value of a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan taught that if assessment for damage is less than the value of a Perutah, the damager is lashed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa means, he is exempt from paying (but he is lashed).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, when it says that the son is liable, it means that he pays (but we said that the damage was less than a Perutah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa means, his son is liable his appropriate punishment (Misah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, when it says that a stranger is exempt, it means 'from his appropriate punishment (lashes)'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, a stranger is exempt because it says "v'Nasi <i>b'Amcha</i> Lo Sa'or", one who acts like one of your nation.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to exempt hitting one who does not act like Amcha?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We equate the laws of hitting and cursing (from a Binyan Av. Alternatively, since they are written near each other, this is like a Hekesh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, also the son should be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is like Rav Pinchas answered (elsewhere), he did Teshuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, also a stranger should be liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mari):</span> "B'Amcha" refers to one who will persist in (doing actions of) your nation (but not one sentenced to die, even if he did Teshuvah - Aruch l'Ner).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, also the son should be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">85b----------------------------------------85b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A son is liable for cursing his father even after his father died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Halachah (may Beis Din appoint a son to lash or curse his father)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Rav Huna, also Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> A son may not be appointed to lash or curse his father, unless his father was a Mesis, about whom it says "v'Lo Sachmol v'Lo Sechaseh Alav."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HITTING AND CURSING A PARENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who wounds his father or mother is not liable unless he made a wound.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>In this respect, cursing is more stringent than hitting. One is liable for cursing his father after death, but not for hitting after death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "Aviv v'Imo Kilel" - after death;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Since one is Chayav Misah for hitting or cursing, just like one is exempt for hitting after death, the same should apply to cursing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> The Torah obligates for hitting even one who is not "Amcha" (our Tana argues with the Tana of the Beraisa on 85a), yet one is exempt for hitting after death. The Torah obligates for cursing only "Amcha", and all the more so one should be exempt for cursing after death!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Aviv v'Imo Kilel" to teach that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yonason can learn like this, but R. Yoshiyah expounds this verse differently!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yoshiyah):</span> "Ish Ish" includes a daughter, Tumtum (someone of unknown gender) or Androginus (who has male and female genitals) who curses a parent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Asher Yekalel Es Aviv v'Es Imo" teaches only if he curses both. What is the source if he curses only one of them?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "Aviv v'Imo Kilel" - cursing is written next to the mother (as well as next to the father) to teach that he is liable even if he curses only one of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yonason):</span> "Aviv <i>v</i>'Es Imo" connotes even one, unless the Torah explicitly says 'together' (as it does regarding Kilayim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yoshiyah learns from "u'Mekalel Aviv v'Imo Mos Yumas";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yonason uses this to obligate a daughter, Tumtum or Androginus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't he learn from "Ish Ish"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that the Torah speaks like people do. (They sometimes double words, therefore, we need not expound the repetition.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't the Mishnah teach that hitting is more stringent than cursing? One is liable for hitting even one who is not "Amcha", but one is exempt for cursing such a person!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana of our Mishnah equates the laws of hitting and cursing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Tana'im of our Mishnah and the Beraisa argue like the following Tana'im do:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> We are commanded not to hit Kusim (the people Sancheriv settled in place of the 10 exiled Shevatim, who later converted), but we are not forbidden to curse them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> We are not forbidden to hit or curse Kusim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> All agree that Kusim are valid converts (just they do not act like Amcha). The second Tana equates the laws of hitting and cursing, and the first Tana does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, neither Tana equates hitting and cursing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana holds that Kusim are valid converts. The second Tana holds that their conversion was only to avoid being eaten by lions (it was insincere), so they are Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (of rejection):</span> Beraisa #2 continues 'the law of his ox is like a Yisrael's ox (if it damaged or was damaged).' This shows that they are considered Yisraelim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Indeed, the Beraisos argue about whether or not we equate hitting and cursing.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LIABILITY FOR KIDNAPPING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who kidnaps a Yisrael is not liable until he takes him into his premises.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, he is not liable until he takes him into his premises and makes him work - "v'His'amer Bo."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yishmael the son of R. Yochanan ben Brokah says, if one kidnaps his son he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yehudah says, if one kidnaps a half-slave he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Chachamim exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Does the first Tana obligate even though he did not make him work?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> They argue about Imur (making him work) less than the value of a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If he kidnaps and sells while he is sleeping (this will be explained), what is the law? If he sold a fetus in a pregnant woman, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is this the way of Imur?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The one sold cannot work at all now, surely the kidnapper is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he can work now. The buyer can lean on the sleeping person, and the fetus (enlarges his mother's stomach and) blocks the wind.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>These questions are not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> "Ki Yimatzei Ish Gonev Nefesh me'Echav" teaches about a man who kidnapped a man or woman;</p>
