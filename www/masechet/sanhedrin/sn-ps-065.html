<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>OV AND YID'ONI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Ba'al Ov is a witch who raises the dead under his armpit, from where it talks;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Yid'oni is one who talks with his mouth (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Both of these are stoned. One who asks (either of them to conjure up the dead) transgresses a Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does our Mishnah mention both Ov and Yid'oni, and the Mishnah in Kerisus (which lists all the Chayvei Kerisus, for which one brings a Korban if he was Shogeg) teaches Ov and omits Yid'oni?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> Since one Lav forbids both of them, there is only one Kares. (If someone transgressed both b'Shogeg in one He'elem, he brings only one Korban).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> Yid'oni is not Chayav Kares because it is done without an action.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yochanan, why did the Mishnah list Ov, and omit Yid'oni (and not the opposite)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It taught the first one in the verse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Reish Lakish explain like R. Yochanan?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> The Torah is Mechayav Misah for Ov <i>or</i> Yid'oni. This teaches that each obligates Misah by itself. If Yid'oni were Chayav Kares, one who transgressed Ov <i>and</i> Yid'oni (b'Shogeg) would bring two Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan says that since the Torah does not write a separate Lav for each, they are considered like one.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BRINGING A <i>KORBAN</i> FOR A SIN THAT INVOLVED NO ACTION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't R. Yochanan explain like Reish Lakish?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He says that the Mishnah in Kerisus is R. Akiva, who obligates a Korban even without an action.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reish Lakish says, even R. Akiva requires a small action to obligate a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah lists Megadef (blasphemy). What action is there?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Moving the lips is a (small) action. (Yid'oni need not even move his lips.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What action does a Ba'al Ov do?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He bangs his arms.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Reish Lakish say that even Chachamim consider this an action?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One is liable (to bring a Korban) only for an action, such as slaughtering, burning, Nisuch, or bowing.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The Beraisa obligates for bowing. It is like R. Akiva, who does not require a (big) action.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It is even like Chachamim. They consider bending one's stature to be an action.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Reish Lakish says that Chachamim do not consider bending one's stature to be an action. All the more so, banging one's arms is not an action!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reish Lakish says only that R. Akiva considers it to be an action, but Chachamim do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (In the Seifa of that Mishnah, Chachamim exempt Megadef from a Korban, for it does not have an action.) If so they should also exempt Ba'al Ov!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 6 - Ula):</span> Chachamim obligate a Ba'al Ov who offers incense to the Shed (that performs the Kishuf of Ov).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If so, he is liable for idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> Chachamim obligate a Ba'al Ov who offers incense(Rashi in Kerisus - to the leader of the Shedim) <i>in order to gather</i> Shedim (that perform Ov. The incense is not offered<i> </i>to worship them).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> This is "Chover Chaver" (which is only a Lav)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When done for the sake of Ov, it is Chayav Misah. (Chover Chaver who whispers charms to gather animals is only a Lav.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Chover Chaver" is whether he gathers (through Kishuf) large or small animals, even snakes and scorpions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Therefore, one may not gather (through Kishuf) wasps and scorpions (to a deserted place; alternatively, incite them to kill each other), even though he intends to stop them from damaging others (unless they are chasing someone. Then, it is Piku'ach Nefesh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Yochanan say that Chachamim consider bending one's stature to be an action, but not moving one's lips?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> Megadef is not considered an action because it depends on one's intention (Rashi; Tosfos - a verse calls it intention).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">65b----------------------------------------65b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Zeira - Beraisa):</span> Zomemim witnesses are excluded (from bringing a Chatas) because they do not do an action.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>False testimony does not depend on one's intention!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> False testimony is different because it depends on voice (which is intangible).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yochanan considers voice like an action!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If someone used is voice to muzzle an animal (he shouted at it when it wanted to eat) or make diverse species work together, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> He is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yochanan obligates, for he holds that moving one's mouth is an action;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Reish Lakish exempts, for he holds that it is not an action.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> False testimony is different because it depends on what they (claimed to, but did not) see (i.e. inaction. Some say that this is a second answer to Question (e).)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OV AND YID'ONI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Ba'al Ov is one who raises the dead and makes him speak from a joint of the Mechashef (e.g. his knee);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yid'oni is one who puts a bone of a Yadu'a (a certain Chayah) in his mouth. The bone speaks by itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "V'Hayah k'Ov me'Eretz Kolech" implies that the voice is heard normally (from the ground, i.e. his grave)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he talks from the Mechashef's joint. (The voice is low because he has no life.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "...Elohim (an angel, i.e. the spirit of Shmuel) Ra'isi Olim Min ha'Aretz."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>His voice was heard from the ground!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it was heard from the Mechashefah's joint.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The same law applies to a Ba'al Ov that raises the Mes on his Ever, or one who asks questions to a skull (and makes it answer);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The difference is, a Mes does not come up on the Ever normally (rather, upside down), and it cannot come on Shabbos. When asking a skull; it arises normally, and it can come on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> When asking a skull; it stays still!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> When asking a skull, it answers normally (without resting on the Ba'al Ov's joint), and it can answer on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Turnusrufus:</span> Why do you say that one day (Shabbos) is more special than others?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Why do you say that one person (such as yourself) is more special than others?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Turnusrufus:</span> My master (the king) chose to elevate me.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Likewise, Hash-m chose to elevate Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Turnusrufus:</span> How do you know that what you call Shabbos is the day Hash-m chose?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> We can prove this from the Sabatyon river (it is calm on Shabbos, it rages all other days), from a Ba'al Ov (it does not come up on Shabbos), or from your father's grave (smoke emits from it every day except for Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Asking an Ov is the same as "Doresh El ha'Mesim." Why does the Torah write both together?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "V'Doresh El ha'Mesim" is one who starves himself and spends the night in a cemetery, in order that a spirit of Tum'ah will rest on him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> One who starves himself in order that a spirit of Tum'ah will rest on him achieves his goal. All the more so, one who starves himself in order that a spirit of Taharah will rest on him should achieve this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We do not reach Taharah due to our sins - "Avonoseichem Hayu Mavdilim Beineichem l'Vein Elokeichem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Tzadikim wanted, they could (be totally sin- free and) create a world - "Avonoseichem Hayu Mavdilim..." (If not for sins, they would be like Hash-m.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Rava created a man. He sent him to R. Zeira. R. Zeira talked to him, he did not respond.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> You are not a real person. A Chacham created you. Return to the dust!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Every Erev Shabbos R. Chanina and R. Oshaya would use Sefer Yetzirah to create an Eglah Tilsa (it a third grown calf. Some say that it was as good as the third calf born from a cow), and eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Me'onen is one who puts semen of seven men on the eye;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Chachamim say, it is a sleight of hand magician (who <i>appears</i> to do magic);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>R. Akiva says, it is one who 'calculates' times that are good or bad, e.g. today is good to embark, tomorrow is good to buy, wheat is good in Erev Shemitah, if one uproots legumes without harvesting them they will not rot or grow wormy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Menachesh is superstition, looking for or acting according to omens like the following:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>His bread fell from his mouth, his staff fell from his hand, his son called to him from behind him, a deer crossed his path, a snake was on his right, a fox was on his left, do not collect the tax from me first, I do not want to pay my debt now, it is the start of the day or week or month.</p>
