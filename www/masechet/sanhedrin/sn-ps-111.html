<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW MANY WILL BE SPARED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "Hirchivah She'ol (Gehinom will accommodate, i.e. punish) li'Vli Chok" - even one who did not observe even one law. (Maharsha - his sins and Mitzvos were equal, he did not fulfill one additional Mitzvah which would have made him mostly Mitzvos; Sefer ha'Ikarim (brought in Anaf Yosef) - he needs Gehinom to achieve the ultimate perfection normally obtained through that Mitzvah; Ri Mintz (ibid) - one who cast off the yoke of a Mitzvah (was never careful to guard it) is like one who denies Torah, he is eternally punished).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yochanan):</span> Hash-m will not judge so harshly!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, even one who learned (Ramah - fulfilled) a single law will be spared. (Ri Mintz - he is eternally punished only if he says that there is no such Mitzvah in the Torah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "B'Chol ha'Aretz...Pi Shnayim Bah Yikarsu Yigva'u veha'Shelishis Yivaser Bah" - two thirds of the descendants of Shem's third son (Arpachshad) will die when Mashi'ach comes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yochanan):</span> Do not say this (if most descendants of Arpachshad at the time will be Yisrael, this would mean that a large portion of Yisrael will die)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, the third son of Noach's third son (i.e. all descendants of Arpachshad) will survive,</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish (and Rav Kahana)):</span> "V'Lakachti Eschem Echas me'Ir u'Shanyim mi'Mishpachah" is literally true (only one from a city or two from a nation (of Nochrim) will survive).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yochanan (and Rav)):</span> Do not say this! Rather, Hash-m will spare a city even due to one Tzadik in it, and a nation due to two Tzadikim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rav saw that Rav Kahana would shampoo his hair before coming to learn, he said "Lo Simatzei b'Eretz ha'Chayim."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Kahana:</span> Do you curse me?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> No - the verse means, Torah is not found in those who look to live comfortably.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Simai):</span> "V'Lakachti Eschem...v'Heveisi Eschem" - the Torah equates leaving Mitzrayim to entering Eretz Yisrael - just like only two out of 600,000 (counted in the Midbar) entered Eretz Yisrael, also only two out of every 600,000 (that were in Mitzrayim) left Mitzrayim (the rest died during the plague of darkness).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The same applies to Yemos Mashi'ach - "Uch'Yom Alosah me'Eretz Mitzrayim."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TRAITS THAT HASH-M DESIRES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> A Mitzri told me that the Mitzriyim drowned some Yisraelim in the sea, killed others by the sword, and mashed others into buildings (in place of bricks);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Moshe was punished for this - he said "Ume'Az Basi El Paro...Hera la'Am ha'Zeh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> There is no one today like the Avos! I promised Eretz Yisrael to the Avos with the name "Kel Shakai", they never asked My name (i.e. which attribute will fulfill the promise);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>I told Avraham "Hishalech ba'Aretz...Ki Lecha Etnenah"; he could not find a burial place for Sarah until he paid 400 Shekalim, he did not resent this;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>I told Yitzchak "Gur ba'Aretz ha'Zos v'Ehyeh Imcha va'Avarcheka"; his slaves could not find water to drink without contention, he did not resent this;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>I told Yakov "Ha'Aretz Asher Atah Shochev Aleha Lecha Etnenah"; he could not find a place to pitch his tent until he paid 100 Keshitah, he did not resent this;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>None of them asked My name - but you (Moshe) asked My name from the beginning, and now you say "Lo Hitzalta Es Amecha" - "Atah Sir'eh Asher E'eseh l'Far'o", but you will not live to see what I will do to the 31 kings in Eretz Yisrael (when Bnei Yisrael enter).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Ymaher Moshe va'Yikod Artzah va'Yishtachu" - what did he see (that made him rush to bow)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chanina ben Gamliel):</span> He saw the attribute 'Erech Apayim' (slow to anger).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabanan):</span> He saw the attribute of Emes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Chanina ben Gamliel - Beraisa):</span> When Moshe went up to receive the Torah, he saw Hash-m writing "Erech Apayim" (in the Torah). Moshe said that this should be only for Tzadikim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> It is even for Resha'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Moshe:</span> Resha'im should perish!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> You will (later) see the need for Erech Apayim for Resha'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>When Yisrael sinned (with the Meraglim, and Moshe prayed that Yisrael be spared), Hash-m said 'you said that Erech Apayim should be only for Tzadikim!'</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">111b----------------------------------------111b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Moshe:</span> "V'Atah Yigdal Na Ko'ach Hash-m Ka'asher Dibarta Leimor (Hash-m Erech Apayim)" - You said that it is even for Resha'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Chaga heard a child saying "Edosecha Ne'emnu Me'od...Hash-m l'Orech Yamim (i.e. the attribute Erech Apayim)" - (presumably, Moshe said this, for) this is shortly after "Tefilah l'Moshe";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Chaga:</span> This shows that he saw Erech Apayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> In the future, Hash-m will be a crown on every Tzadik - "B'Yom ha'Hu Yihyeh Hash-m Tzevakos la'Ateres Tzvi..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "La'Ateres Tzvi veli'Tzfiras Tif'arah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is for those who do His Tzivyon (will) and await His Tif'arah (glory).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is for all who do His will, even if they get haughty!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Li'Sh'ar Amo" - only for one who considers himself like Shirayim (leftovers).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>"Ul'Ru'ach Mishpat" is one who rules over his Yetzer ha'Ra; "Ul'Yoshev Al ha'Mishpat" is a judge who gives the proper verdict; "Veli'Gvurah" is one who overcomes his Yetzer ha'Ra; "Meshivei Milchamah" is one who debates in Torah; "Sharah" - these are those who come early and stay late in Batei Keneses and Batei Medrash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Midas ha'Din:</span> Why are Tzadikim with these Midos treated better than others who do Your will?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> The others (were not such Tzadikim -) "Ba'Yayin Shagu...";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Paku" - they will go to Gehinom, due to "Peliliyah" (judgment, when they were drunk).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IR HA'NIDACHAS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Residents of an Ir ha'Nidachas....[have no share in the world to come - "Yatzu Anashim Bnei Veliya'al mi'Kirbecha (they left your midst, i.e. your share in the world to come)." Ran deletes this from the text, for those killed by Beis Din confess and have a share in the world to come.]</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>They are beheaded only if they were enticed by men of their city and Shevet, and the majority of the city was enticed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the enticers were women or children or came from outside of (the city), or if the minority of the city was enticed, they are stoned like individuals who served idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>(Two) witnesses and warning are required for every transgressor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A stringency of individuals (killed for idolatry) over a city - individuals are stoned, therefore (the Torah is lenient about their money), their money passes to their heirs;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A city is beheaded, therefore their money is destroyed - "Hake Sakeh...l'Fi Charev."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If a caravan of donkey-drivers or camel-drivers stayed in the city (for 30 days), they are considered residents (when calculating whether or not the majority served idolatry), they can cause the city to be saved (or destroyed) - "Ha'Charem Osah v'Es Kol Asher Bah"...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that property of Tzadikim in the city is destroyed, their property outside the city is not;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Property of the Resha'im, even outside of the city is destroyed - "V'Es Kol Shelalah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If there is no square (meeting place) in the city, we build one; if it is outside the city, we bring it in - "Tikbotz El Toch Rechovah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>"V'Sarafta...v'Es Kol <i>Shelalah</i>" - its spoils, and not Hash-m's - this teaches that if there was Hekdesh inside, we redeem it (and do not burn it); if there was Terumah, we let it rot; if there was Ma'aser Sheni and Kisvei ha'Kodesh, they are buried.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Shimon says, "Kalil la'Shem" teaches that if we properly destroy an Ir ha'Nidachas, Hash-m considers it like an Olah (which is Kalil, totally consumed on the Mizbe'ach).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Yosi ha'Galili says "V'Haysah Tel Olam" forbids using it for gardens or orchards;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Akiva says, "Lo Sibaneh Od" forbids rebuilding it as it was (a city), but it may be used for gardens or orchards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>"Ve'Lo Yidbak b'Yadcha Me'umah Min ha'Cherem" - as long as there are Resha'im in the world, Hash-m's anger is in the world; when Resha'im perish from the world, Hash-m's anger leaves the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "Yatzu" - enticers themselves, and not their messengers; "Anashim" - this denotes at least two, and excludes women and children;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Bnei Veliya'al" - children (Bli Ol) that cast the yoke of Shamayim off their necks;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Mi'Kirbecha" - amidst you, and not from the border of Eretz Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Yoshvei Iram" - not residents of another city;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"Leimor" - witnesses and warning are required for every transgressor;</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DIVIDING A CITY AMONG TWO TRIBES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> A city may be divided among two tribes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> It may not be divided among two tribes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan - Mishnah):</span> They are beheaded only if they were enticed by men of their city and Shevet.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Even though the enticers are from the same city, it only becomes an Ir ha'Nidachas if they are from the same Shevet, i.e. the city was divided among two tribes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the case is, people from a different Shevet inherited (or received a gift of) land in the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Arim Tesha me'Es Shnei ha'Shevatim ha'Elu";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Each Shevet gave four and a half cities, i.e. a city was divided among two tribes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, one Shevet gave four cities, the other gave five.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the verse should specify how many each gave!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
