<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "Aniyah Anasos"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The prophecy that Yerushalayim will fall to Nebuchadnetzar will come from Yirmeyah of Anasos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Nebuchadnetzar is called Aryeh, and not Layish!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both are among six names for lions - Ari, Kefir, Lavi, Layish, Shachal and Shachatz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If "Aniyah Anasos" refers to Yirmeyah, Sancheriv only made nine journeys!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ovru Mabarah" refers to two journeys.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "Od ha'Yom b'Nov La'amod"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> This was the last day that Yisrael were still worthy to be punished for killing the Kohanim of Nov. Had Sancheriv attacked Yerushalayim (and not waited for the morrow), he would have conquered it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Sancheriv's astrologers told him 'if you attack now, you will conquer Yerushalayim; if not, you will not.' He traveled what is normally a journey of 10 days in one day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>When he got to Yerushalayim, he piled up carpets higher than the walls and sat on them, and saw the entire city. It was small in his eyes. He regretted having brought all his army and bothered conquering so many places (on the route) to get to Yerushalayim. 'It is smaller than all the other cities I conquered!' He waved his head and hands at it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">His army:</span> Let us begin the battle!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Sancheriv:</span> You are tired from the journey. Tomorrow, everyone will bring to me a small piece of the wall (and we will conquer the city).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>"Va'Yetzei Mal'ach Hash-m va'Yach (185,000 men)... va'Boker Chulam Pegarim Mesim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This is like people say, if judgment is left for the morrow, it will not happen.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DAVID'S PUNISHMENT FOR NOV</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does "va'Yishbi b'Nov..." mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is Ish she'Ba (a man who came) to kill David, to be his punishment for the killing of the Kohanim of Nov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> You have been liable for this sin for too long! Through you, Do'eg sinned (by telling Lashon ha'Ra to Sha'ul, that Achimelech helped David, which caused that) of Kohanim of Nov were killed (on Sha'ul's command), and (due to this) Sha'ul and his three sons were killed! Either your descendants will be killed off, or you will be captured by the enemy.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> It is better that I be taken by the enemy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One day, David went hunting (alternatively - to a certain village). The Satan appeared to him like a deer. He shot an arrow at it, but it did not reach it. He pursued it to Eretz Plishtim; Yishbi b'Nov (a giant) recognized that this was David who had killed his brother Galyus. Yishbi tied him up and put him under the olive-press (some texts - under a sheet) and sat on him (to crush him).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A miracle occurred, the ground under him became soft, David was not hurt (alternatively - the ground formed a crater to protect him) - "Tarchiv Tza'adi Sachtai v'Lo Ma'adu Karsulai."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It was Erev Shabbos. Avishai ben Tzeruyah was shampooing his hair. He saw drops of blood (Some say, he saw a dove shaking itself in front of him - Yisrael is compared to a dove, "Kanfei Yonah Nechpah ba'Kesef.") (Ramah - because Yisrael was not in trouble,) he deduced that David was in trouble. He looked in David's house, and did not find him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (Avishai):</span> The Mishnah says, we may not ride on a king's horse, nor sit on his throne, or use his scepter - does this apply even at a time of danger?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabanan in the Beis Medrash):</span> At a time of danger it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Avishai rode on David's mule; he experienced Kefitzas ha'Derech (he travelled miraculously quickly) and arrived in Eretz Plishtim. He saw Orpah (the mother of Yishbi) weaving. When she saw him, she slipped the spindle off the thread and flung it towards him (hoping to kill him, but she missed. She pretended that it fell accidentally.) She asked him to bring it. He threw it at her head and killed her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Yishbi saw Avishai. He was concerned lest Avishai and David together be able to kill him. He threw David up and inserted his sword in the ground, so David would land on it and die. Avishai said a name of Hash-m, suspending David in mid-air.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't David do so himself?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A prisoner cannot take himself out of jail. (David was in danger, so he lacked the composure to say Hash-m's name.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Avishai:</span> What were you doing here?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">David:</span> Hash-m told me that I must choose a punishment. I opted to be taken by the enemy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Avishai:</span> It is better that you yourself should be safe. Let your children sell wax (be very poor, i.e. face their own problems), but do not sacrifice yourself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">David:</span> Help me pray to switch the punishment!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "Va'Ya'azor Lo Avishai..." - he prayed for him (Ramah - counseled him what to pray for).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Avishai said a name of Hash-m, and David came down; Yishbi chased them. When they reached the village 'Kubi', they said 'this is a good place to Kum Bei (oppose him).'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When they reached the village 'Bei Trei', they said 'will two lions cubs kill the lion?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They told him 'Orpah, your mother is in the grave.' The mention of her name (Maharsha - which alludes to the throng that were Oref (had Bi'ah with) her) made him grow weak, and they killed him - "Az Nishbe'u Anshei David Lo Leimor Lo Setzei Od Itanu la'Milchamah v'Lo Sevakeh Es Ner Yisrael."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Three people experienced Kefitzas ha'Derech: Eliezer (Avraham's slave), Yakov and Avishai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding R. Eliezer it says "va'Avo ha'Yom El ha'Ayin." This implies that he arrived the same day he left;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">95b----------------------------------------95b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding Yakov it says "...va'Yelech Charanah (this implies that he already arrived there) and it says "va'Yifga ba'Makom"!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>After he reached Charan, he regretted that he had not prayed at the place (of the Akeidah) where Avraham and Yitzchak had prayed. Once he decided to return, he had Kefitzas ha'Derech and immediately arrived - "va'Yifga ba'Makom"!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>(Alternatively, "va'Yifga" denoes prayer - "Al Tispalel... v'Al Tifga Bi" - Gra deletes this from the text.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Va'Yalen Sham Ki Va ha'Shemesh" - after he prayed, he wanted to return, but Hash-m wanted him to spend the night at His dwelling (the Beis ha'Mikdash would later be built there), therefore He made the sun set immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This explains "va'Yizrach Lo ha'Shemesh."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The sun shines for everyone!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> The sun, which had set early due to Yakov, now shone early for him (to heal his thigh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where do we find that David's descendants were killed off?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Va'Asalyah...va'Te'abed Es Kol Zera ha'Mamlachah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Yo'ash remained!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was proper for one person to remain, for this was a punishment for the killing of the Kohanim of Nov, and there also, one remained - "va'Yimalet Ben Echad la'Achimelech... Evyasar."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Had Evyasar not remianed, there would not have been any remnant of David's seed!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SANCHERIV'S CAMPAIGN TO CONQUER YERUSHALAYIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Sancheriv came against Yerushalayim with 45,000 princes in gold carriages with queens and harlots, and 80,000 soldiers in armor, 60,000 sword-bearing soldiers running in front of him, and others on horses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A similar army opposed Avraham (when he fought the four kings), and a similar army will come with Gog and Magog.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The length of the army was 400 Parsa'os, the width of the horses' necks (if they would stand side by side) was 40 Parsa'os; the total number of soldiers was 2,600,000 thousands, less one. (It is unclear whether this means less one soldier, or less 1,000.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Cholaf bi'Yhudah Shataf v'Avar" - the first soldiers swam across the Yarden river;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Due to what they drank and the water absorbed in their garments), the middle ones walked through the water - "Ad Tzavar Yagi'a";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The river was totally dry when the last ones came. They kicked up dirt and had to find a new source of water to drink - "Karti v'Shasisi Mayim (v'Achriv b'Chaf Pe'amai Kol Ye'orei Matzor."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yetzei Mal'ach Hash-m va'Yach (185,000 men)... Chulam Pegarim Mesim" (there were only 185,000)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> Those were the troop leaders.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> "B'Mishmanav Razon" - the verse discusses only the fat (important) ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support #2 (Ravina):</span> "Va'Yachched Kol Gibor Chayil v'Nagid v'Sar ba'Machaneh (the verse discusses only the officers)...v'Yavo (Sancheriv) Beis Elohav u'Mitzi'ei Me'av Sham Hipiluhu ve'Charev."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did he (the angel) used to kill them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Eliezer):</span> He used His hand. "Va'Yar Yisrael (at Kri'as Yam Suf) Es <i>ha'Yad</i> ha'Gedolah" refers to the hand that will later wipe out Sancheriv's army. ? (Chidushei Agados Maharal - Hash-m's hand was with the angel.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehoshua):</span> He used His finger. "Etzba Elokim Hu" refers to the finger that will later wipe out Sancheriv's army.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Eliezer, son of R. Yosi ha'Galili):</span> Hash-m told Gavri'el to sharpen his scythe to destroy them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Gavri'el:</span> It has been sharpened, waiting for this from six days of creation - "Nadadu Mipnei Cherev Netushah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> It was the time when fruits ripen. Hash-m told Gavri'el to destroy them when he goes to ripen the fruits - "Midei Ovru Yikach Eschem..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This is like people say, on the way, make your enemy hear you (to frighten him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> Some say, Hash-m blew into their nostrils - "v'Gam Nofash Bahem va'Yivashu";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (R. Yirmeyah bar Aba):</span> He clapped His hands in front of them and they died - "Akeh Kapi El Kapi v'Hanichosi Chamasi."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #6 (R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> He uncovered their ears, enabling them to hear Shirah of the Chayos (a class of angels) - "me'Romemusecha Noftzu Goyim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How many of the army remained?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> Ten remained. "U'Sh'ar Etz Yaro Mispar v'Na'ar Yichtevem" - a child can write (Yud, which is a mere drop of ink, and signifies) 10.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> Nine remained. "V'Nish'ar Bo Olelos... Shnayim Sheloshah Gargarim b'Rosh Amir <i>Arba'ah Chamishah</i> bi'Se'ifeha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Fourteen remained (we add <i>all</i> the numbers in the above verse).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Yochanan):</span> Five remained - Sancheriv and his two sons, and Nebuchadnetzar and Nevuzaradan (who later brought the Churban).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We have a tradition that Nevuzaradan was there;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We learn Nebuchadnetzar from "v'Reveh Di Revi'a'ah Damei l'Var Elahin (his form resembles an angel)." Had he not seen the angel kill Sancheriv's camp, how would he know the form of angels?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We learn that Sancheriv and his two sons survived from "Hu Mishtachaveh Beis Nisroch Elohav v'Adramelech v'Sar'etzer Banav Hikuhu va'Cherev." (The verses do not say that his sons were there, but since he was so confident of victory, surely he took them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> If we did not have the verse, it would be forbidden for us to say the following!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"B'Yom ha'Hu Yegalach Hash-m... b'Melech Ashur Es ha'Rosh..." - Hash-m assumed the guise of an old man, and came (Ramah - Hash-m prompted an old man to come) in front of Sancheriv.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The old man:</span> When you return to the kings of the east and west, what will you say to them? (You took their princes to witness your expected victory, and they all died!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Sancheriv:</span> I worry about this! What should I say?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">The old man:</span> Disguise yourself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Sancheriv:</span> How can I do so?</p>
