<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE IS ALWAYS LIABLE FOR HIS MOTHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rava - Beraisa):</span> "Ish" excludes a minor. "Asher Yishkav Es Eshes Aviv" connotes whether or not she is his mother;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to obligate Misah for his mother if she is not his father's wife?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ervas Aviv Gilah" is free to learn from a Gezerah Shavah. (The answer is finished below (13).)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Mos Yumsu" - they are stoned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it refers to a different Misah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says here "Demeihem Bam", and also regarding Ov and Yid'oni. Just like there it refers to stoning, also here.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches the punishment. Which verse forbids Bi'ah with her?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ervas Avicha Lo Segale" refers to your father's wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it refers to your father himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Ervas Avicha Lo Segale", and it says "Ervas Aviv Gilah";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like the latter refers to his father's wife, also the former.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This includes his father's wife whether or not she is his mother. What is the source to forbid his mother if she is not his father's wife?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ervas Imcha Lo Segale."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps his mother is forbidden whether or not she is his father's wife, but they are Chayav Misah only if she is his father's wife!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Ervas Avicha Lo Segale", and "Ervas Aviv Gilah";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like the mother is forbidden in every case, the punishment is Misah in every case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span>"Imcha Hi" - he is liable only for his mother, but not for his father's wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim explain, "Ervas Avicha" refers to Bi'ah with your father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> All Mishkav Zachar (homosexual relations) is forbidden - "v'Es Zachar"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> For Bi'ah with his father he is liable also due to "Ervas Avicha", like Rav Yehudah taught.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a Nochri had Bi'ah with his father, or with his father's brother he is liable twice.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Presumably, Rav Yehudah refers to a Yisrael. If he was Shogeg he brings two Korbanos;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>'Nochri' is a euphemism. He did not want to attribute such an act to a Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If it really referred to a Nochri, he is killed for transgressing any of his Mitzvos (even b'Shogeg). It is impossible to punish him twice!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If one had Bi'ah with his father, or with his father's brother, he is liable twice.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1:</span> The Beraisa is unlike R. Yehudah. (He uses "Ervas Avicha" for a Gezerah Shavah. It does not teach about Bi'ah with his father.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2:</span> The Beraisa is even like R. Yehudah. He learns (extra) liability for (Mishkav Zachar with) his father from a Kal va'Chomer from his (paternal) uncle:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If one is liable (an extra Korban) for (Bi'ah with) his uncle, the relative of his father, all the more so he is liable for his father!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Chachamim and R. Yehudah argue as Abaye and Rava do, about whether we punish based on a Kal va'Chomer):</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yehudah says that we do. That is his source to obligate for the father;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim say that we do not. They expound "Ervas Avicha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's source to forbid a father's wife?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They learn from "Ervas Eshes Avicha Lo Segale."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah uses that to forbid a father's widow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim learn this from the end of the verse - "Ervas Avicha Hi."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah uses this to teach that (if she is married) you are liable only for your father's wife, and not for a married woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If one had Bi'ah with his father's wife, he is liable for this and for a married woman, whether or not his father is alive.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yehudah does not argue!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> He does not argue in the Mishnah, but (we may infer that) he argues in the Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's source to punish for a father's widow?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah can learn from the Gezerah Shavah, but Chachamim do not learn from it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah used "Ervas Aviv Gilah" for a Gezerah Shavah. Chachamim use this to teach Misah for a father's widow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's source to punish for one's mother if she was not his father's wife?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> "Imcha Hi" - the Torah equates a mother not married to the father with one who is married to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who had Bi'ah with his daughter-in-law...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should also be liable for Bi'ah with his son's wife (since the Torah gives this as another name for the Isur)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Torah begins by calling her Kalaso (daughter-in-law), and ends by calling her his son's wife, to teach that these are the same Isur.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MISHKAV ZACHAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Men who have Mishkav Zachar, or a man or woman who transgressed bestiality (and the animal) are stoned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The person sinned, why is the animal killed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Because the animal led to the downfall of a person, it is stoned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Also, the Torah does not want that people will see the animal and mention that Ploni was stoned due to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source to stone for Mishkav Zachar?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Ish" - this excludes a minor; "Asher Yishkav Es Zachar" - whether he (the one he lies with) is a minor or adult;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Mishkevei Ishah" teaches that there are two kinds of Bi'ah with a woman (normal, and abnormal, i.e. in the anus. The same laws apply to both.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yishmael says, this (seemingly) came to teach (about Mishkav Zachar), but (since it is not needed for this, for there is only one way to do it), it teaches about Bi'ah with a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Mos Yumasu" - by stoning;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they receive a different Misah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says here "Demeihem Bam", and also regarding Ov and Yid'oni. Just like there it refers to stoning, also here.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">54b----------------------------------------54b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches the punishment. Where does the Torah forbid Mishkav Zachar?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Es Zachar Lo Sishkav Mishkevei Ishah To'evah Hi."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This forbids the Shochev (the man who inserts his Ever). Where does the Torah forbid the Nishkav (the man on the receiving end)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yishmael):</span> It says "Lo Yihyeh Kadesh mi'Bnei Yisrael"; and it says "Kadesh Hayah va'Aretz Asu k'Chol ha'<i>To'avos</i>" (this refers to Mishkav Zachar in the above verse. The plural alludes to both of them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Akiva):</span> We learn from "Lo Sishkav" - we (also) read this 'Lo Sishachev" (to be the Nishkav).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where does the Torah say to kill for bestiality?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ish" excludes a minor. "Asher Yiten Shechavto bi'Vhemah" - whether it is big or small. "Mos Yumas" - he is stoned.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says here "Taharogu", like it says about a Mesis. Just like there it refers to stoning, also here.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This punishes one who is Shochev with an animal. Where does the Torah punish a Nishkav?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Kol Shochev Im Behemah Mos Yumas."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since we do not need this to teach about a Shochev, we use it to teach about a Nishkav.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Uv'Chol Behemah Lo Siten Shechavtecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This forbids to be Shochev with an animal. Where does the Torah forbid a Nishkav?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yishmael):</span> It says "Lo Yihyeh Kadesh"; and it says "Kadesh Hayah... (k'Chol ha'<i>To'avos</i>." Also bestiality is called To'evah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Akiva):</span> It says "Lo Siten Shechavtecha." We (also) read this 'Lo Siten Shechivasecha' (to be Nishkav).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> If Reuven was Shochev with a man and was Nishkav with a man:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Yishmael, he is liable twice (i.e. if he was Shogeg, he brings two Korbanos), for because different verses forbid these - "Lo Sishkav" and "Lo Yihyeh Kadesh");</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to R. Akiva, he is liable once, for both are learned from (different ways to read) "Lo Sishkav."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> If Reuven was Shochev with and was Nishkav with an animal:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Yishmael, he is liable twice, for "Lo Siten Shechavtecha" and "Lo Yihyeh Kadesh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to R. Akiva, he is liable once, for both are learned from (readings of) "Lo Siten Shechavtecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Here, R. Yishmael agrees that he is liable only once. "Lo Yihyeh Kadesh" refers to Mishkav Zachar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what is his source to forbid a Nishkav (with an animal)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from "Kol Shochev Im Behemah Mos Yumas." Since we do not need this to teach about a Shochev, (we already have sources that it is forbidden and punishable by stoning), we use it to teach about a Nishkav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah taught about a Nishkav through the word "Shochev" to teach that just like a Shochev is warned and punished, also a Nishkav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> If Reuven was Nishkav with a man and with an animal:</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>If one is Shochev and Nishkav with a man, and is Shochev and Nishkav with an animal, R. Avahu and Abaye agree that R.

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BI'AH OF A MINOR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A boy is not considered like a man. A small animal is considered like a grown animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> This means that we do not consider Bi'ah with a boy less than nine years old like Bi'ah with a boy above nine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It means that we do not consider Bi'ah with a boy less than three like Bi'ah with a boy above three.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav holds that only one who can be Shochev (i.e. a nine-year old, his Shechivah is considered Bi'ah) can be Nishkav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shmuel learns from "Mishkevei Ishah" (a male Nishkav is like a girl. If a three-year old girl is Nishkeves, it is considered Bi'ah)</p>
