<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He must eat meat and drink wine to become a Ben Sorer u'Moreh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Even if he ate many foods, but not meat, and even if he drank many beverages, but not wine, he cannot become a Ben Sorer u'Moreh until he eats meat and drinks wine - "Zolel v'Sovei."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"B'Sov'ei Yayin" (does not prove, but) hints that 'Sovei' refers to drinking wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also, it says "Ki Sovei v'Zolel Yivaresh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> "U'Kra'im Talbish Numah" - anyone who sleeps in a Beis Medrash, his Torah becomes fragmented (he only remembers bits and pieces).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FROM WHOM HE MUST STEAL, WHERE HE MUST EAT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he stole from his father and ate in his father's residence, or if he stole from other people and ate in another's residence, he is not a Ben Sorer u'Moreh, unless he steals from his father and eats in another's residence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, he must steal from his father and mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> If he stole from his father and ate in his father's residence (he is exempt). Even though he can steal frequently from his father, he fears that his father will see him, so he will not become habituated;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he stole from others and ate in another's residence, even though he is not afraid, he will not be able to steal frequently, so he will not become habituated;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>All the more so, if he stole from others and ate in his father's residence, he cannot steal frequently and he is afraid, so he will not become habituated;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He is not a Ben Sorer u'Moreh unless he steals from his father and eats in another's residence, for he can steal frequently and he is not afraid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> He must steal from his father and mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can he steal from his mother? A woman's property belongs to her husband!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> He steals a meal prepared for his father and mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chanan bar Moldah taught that he is liable only if he buys meat and wine cheaply and eats them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he steals money designated for a meal for his father and mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Someone else gave money to his mother on condition that her husband has no rights to it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE PARENTS MUST RESEMBLE EACH OTHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If his father wants Beis Din to judge him and his mother does not, or vice-versa, he is not a Ben Sorer u'Moreh - unless both want.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, if his mother is not proper for his father, he does not become a Ben Sorer u'Moreh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the meaning of 'she is not proper for his father'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> She is forbidden to him by Chayavei Kerisus or Chayavei Misos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> In any case, they are his parents! (The Torah does not say that they are married.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She does not resemble him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If his mother does not resemble his father regarding voice, appearance and stature, he does not become a Ben Sorer u'Moreh.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Einenu Shome'a b'Koleinu" - just like their voices must be the same, also their appearance and stature.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like which Tana is the following?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There never was a Ben Sorer u'Moreh, and there never will be;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Torah wrote the Parshah solely for us to expound it and receive reward for doing so.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> This is like R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Will parents willingly take their son to be stoned, just because he (stole and) ate a Tartimar or meat and half a Log of wine?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, there never was a Ben Sorer u'Moreh, and there never will be. The Parshah is written for us to expound it and receive reward.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yonason says, I saw a Ben Sorer u'Moreh, and I sat on his grave.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like which Tana is the following?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There never was a Bayis ha'Menuga (house with Tzara'as), and there never will be;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Torah wrote the Parshah for us to expound it and receive reward.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon):</span> A Bayis ha'Menuga must have appearances (of Tzara'as) on a Gris on each of two stones that touch in the corner (and the appearances touch each other. This is such a remote possibility, that surely it would never occur).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Kir', and it says "Kiros";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A wall that is like two walls is the corner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok):</span> There was a place in the Techum of Azah called 'the closed ruin' (like the Targum of Bayis ha'Menuga).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>R. Shimon Ish Kefar Ako says, in Galil I saw a placed marked off (due to Tum'ah). People said that rocks of a Bayis ha'Menuga were there.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CONDITIONS TO BECOME A <i>BEN SORER U'MOREH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A boy cannot become a Ben Sorer u'Moreh if one of his parents was missing an arm or leg, or was mute or blind or deaf:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Sofsu Bo Aviv v'Imo" - both must have two arms;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We warn him in front of three judges and lash him (after the first time he stole and ate).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he transgressed again, he is judged by 23 judges;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The original three judges must be present when he is judged again. "Bneinu Zeh" refers to the one who was lashed in front of you.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> This teaches that if we cannot fulfill the verse it is as is written, the Parshah does not apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Here is different, for all these words are extra.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">71b----------------------------------------71b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We warn him in front of three.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Two should suffice to warn him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah means, we warn him in front of two and lash him in front of three.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a Ben Sorer u'Moreh is lashed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn like R. Avahu did.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> We learn that Motzi Shem Ra is lashed from a Gezeirah Shavah "v'Yisru-v'Yisru" (from Ben Sorer u'Moreh);</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he transgressed again, he is judged by 23 (the original three must be present - "Bneinu Zeh").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need "Zeh" to teach that his parents must be able to see!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We would know that even if it said 'Bneinu Hu';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it says "Bneinu Zeh" to teach both laws.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>DOES CONVERSION EXEMPT FROM THE DEATH PENALTY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he fled before the final verdict, and his lower beard filled out, he is exempt;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Chanina):</span> If a Ben Noach blasphemed and converted, he is exempt, because his law changed (a Ben Noach can be convicted through one witness, one judge and without warning. A Yisrael requires two witnesses, 23 judges and warning) and his Misah changed (from beheading to stoning).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> If he fled before the final verdict, and his lower beard filled out, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He is exempt because he changed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, he is exempt because if he would transgress now, he would be exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (against R. Chanina - Seifa):</span> If he fled after the verdict, and his lower beard filled out, he is killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Once he was sentenced, it is as if he is dead (therefore, change does not exempt him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a Ben Noach killed his colleague (another Ben Noach) or had Bi'ah with his colleague's wife and converted, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he did so to a Yisrael, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We do not exempt him, even though if he would transgress now, his law would be different!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> In this case, his law changed, but not his Misah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, a Yisrael is beheaded for murder, just like a Ben Noach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, a Yisrael is choked for adultery, and a Ben Noach is beheaded! (Also his Misah changed!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he had Bi'ah with a Na'arah Me'orasah. Even a Ben Noach is stoned for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Beraisa says 'if he did so to a Yisrael, he is liable';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Surely, this resembles the case of (the wife of) his colleague (a Nesu'ah. Kidushin does not apply to Bnei Noach!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (g)):</span> (Really, he had Bi'ah with a Nesu'ah.) Since his Misah changed from beheading to choking, which is more lenient, it is like a continuation of his original Misah, so he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Chachamim, who say that beheading is more stringent than choking;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Shimon, who says that choking is more stringent than beheading, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like Tana d'Vei Menasheh, who says that a Ben Noach is choked for transgressing any of his Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Tana d'Vei Menasheh, granted, a Yisrael is choked for adultery, just like a Ben Noach;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since his Misah changed from choking to beheading, which is more lenient (according to R. Shimon), it is like a continuation of his original Misah, so he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Chanina - Beraisa):</span> If a Na'arah Me'orasah was Mezanah and later became a Bogeres, she is choked.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> She is not stoned because she changed. (Since the new Misah is more lenient, it is like a continuation of her old Misah, and she gets the new Misah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>All the more so, if a Ben Noach blasphemed and converted, his law changed and his Misah became more stringent, so we cannot kill him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yochanan said that the text of the Beraisa should say 'she is <i>stoned</i>.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>WHAT IS BEST FOR <i>RESHA'IM</i> AND <i>TZADIKIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Ben Sorer u'Moreh is not killed for his sin, rather, due to his future. It is better for him to die before he sins even more.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Death of Resha'im is good for them (for this reason), and this is good for the world;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span> Wine and sleep are good for Resha'im, and this is good for the world;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span> These are bad for Tzadikim, and this is bad for the world.</p>
