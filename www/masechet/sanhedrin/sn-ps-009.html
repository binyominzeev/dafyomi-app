<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE ARGUMENT ABOUT MOTZI SHEM RA (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rav Ashi):</span> The case is, she was warned that she will be lashed, but not that she will be killed (according to the opinion that lashes are given for capital transgressions);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Our Tana'im argue like R. Yishmael and Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Three judges are needed for lashes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yishmael says, 23 are needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #6 (Ravina):</span> The case is, one witness was found to be a relative or an invalid witness. Our Tana'im argue like R. Yosi and Rebbi argue about R. Akiva's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> (Two witnesses always suffice. The Torah discusses "two or three witnesses" to be stringent. If all the witnesses are Huzmu,) a third witness is punished like the first two (even though his testimony was not needed);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the Torah punishes one who joins transgressors like the transgressors, and all the more so it rewards one who joins one doing a Mitzvah like the one who does the Mitzvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also, just like if one of two witnesses was found to be a relative or an invalid witness, the entire testimony is invalid, the same applies to if one of three witnesses was found to be invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that this applies even if there are 100 witnesses?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Edim".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Yosi says, this applies to capital cases. In monetary cases, the testimony of the Kosher witnesses is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Rebbi says, R. Akiva's law applies to capital and monetary cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In capital cases, we disqualify all the testimony only if the invalid witness warned the transgressor;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">9b----------------------------------------9b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If not, if one murdered in front of two brothers, no one (even unrelated Kosher witnesses) could testify against him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>(The case is, the invalid witness did not warn the transgressor. Chachamim hold like Rebbi, that the other witnesses can testify. R. Meir holds like R. Yosi, that all the testimony is disqualified.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #7:</span> The case is, people other than the witnesses warned the transgressor. Our Tana'im argue like R. Yosi and Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> A transgressor cannot be killed unless both witnesses warned him - "<i>Al  Pi</i> Shnayim Edim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #8:</span> The case is, the witnesses contradicted each other about Bedikos (questions not crucial to the testimony, e.g. the color of the murderer's clothing), but agreed about Chakiros (questions crucial to the testimony, e.g. the place and time of the murder). Our Tana'im argue like Ben Zakai and Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (A murder occurred under a fig tree.) Ben Zakai asked the witnesses what color the figs were. (They contradicted each other, and their testimony was rejected.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MONETARY LIABILITY WITH A DEATH PENALTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> (In a case of Motzi Shem Ra,) if Reuven brought witnesses of adultery, and her father (David) brought witnesses who were Mezim them, Reuven's witnesses are killed. They do not pay (even though their testimony would also have deprived her of her Kesuvah);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven then brought witnesses who were Mezim David's witnesses, David's witnesses are killed and pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They are killed for trying to kill Reuven's witnesses. They also pay, because they tried to cause a loss to someone else (to make Reuven pay a fine of 100 Shekalim).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SPLITTING TESTIMONY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> If Shimon says 'Levi forcibly raped me', Shimon can join with a second witness to kill Levi;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he says 'I willingly had Bi'ah with him', he is a Rasha (and cannot testify) - "Al Tesht Rasha Ed."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> One is like a relative with respect to himself, so he cannot establish himself to be a Rasha (to disqualify himself from testimony. Therefore, we split his testimony. It is as if he said 'Levi had  Bi'ah  with a man. I consented to have Bi'ah with a man.' We ignore his admission, and he joins with a second witness to kill Levi.)</p>
