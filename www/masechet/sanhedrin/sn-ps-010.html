<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SPLITTING TESTIMONY (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Shimon says 'Levi had Bi'ah with my wife', Shimon can join with a second witness to kill Levi, but not to kill his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is the Chidush that we split his testimony? We know this from Rava's previous teaching!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer:</span> One might have thought that one is a relative with respect to himself, but with respect to his wife he is a valid witness, and he joins with a second witness to kill her. (Ran - because we believe his testimony about Levi, we believe it also about her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ra'avad, brought in Ran) Answer:</span> One might have thought that one is so close to himself that we <i>totally ignore</i> what he says about himself. It is not even considered invalid testimony, therefore his testimony about Levi remains;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, with respect to his wife, he is an invalid witness (a relative), so his testimony about her is invalid, so all his testimony (even about Levi) is disqualified! (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If two witnesses testified that Ploni had Bi'ah with a Na'arah Me'orasah (an Arusah (engaged girl), without specifying her name) and they were Huzmu, they are killed, they do not pay money;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If they testified that he had Bi'ah with Almoni's daughter (and she consented) and they were Huzmu, they are killed and they pay money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They pay her (for trying to reduce her Kesuvah) and they are killed for trying to kill Ploni.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If two witnesses testified that Ploni had Bi'ah with an ox and they were Huzmu, they are killed and they do not pay money;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If they testified that he had Bi'ah with Almoni's ox, and they were Huzmu, they are killed, and they pay money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They pay Almoni (they sought to kill his ox), and they are killed for trying to kill Ploni.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We know this from his previous teaching!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He taught this because he had a question.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If Reuven and David testified 'Ploni had Bi'ah with Reuven's ox', what is the law? (Rashi - he asks about the ox. Surely, we kill Ploni. Ra'avad - he asks even about killing Ploni.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We know that one is like a relative with respect to himself, i.e. if he testifies about himself and another, we split his testimony, we ignore what he says about himself, and accept his testimony about the other;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Is one like a relative with respect to his money (and we ignore what he says about his money), or, do we accept his testimony about his money as well?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> He is a relative with respect to himself, but not with respect to his money.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CASES OF LASHES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Cases of lashes require three judges...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> The plural "u'Shfatum" teaches two judges;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not make a Beis Din with an even number of judges, therefore three judges are required.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should say that "v'Hitzdiku" teaches another two judges, and "v'Hirshi'u" teaches another two, making seven in all!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We expound those as Ula did.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Ula):</span> Where does the Torah hint about Zomemim witnesses?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Torah explicitly discusses them - "Ka'asher Zomam"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, where does the Torah hint that Zomemim witnesses are lashed (when we cannot apply to them what they plotted to do to the subject of their testimony, e.g. if they testified that he is a disqualified Kohen)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Hitzdiku Es ha'Tzadik v'Hirshi'u Es ha'Rasha...";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Acquitting the innocent is not a condition for (lashing the Rasha, the continuation of the verse) "V'Hayah Im Bin Hakos ha'Rasha"!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the case is that (Zomemim) witnesses caused a Tzadik to be convicted, and other witnesses (Mezimim) showed that he was truly a Tzadik and that the first witnesses were Resha'im, "v'Hayah Im Bin Hakos ha'Rasha."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should already know that they are lashed for "Lo Sa'aneh" (do not testify (falsely))!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Lav without an action. (Normally,) one is not lashed for such a Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yishmael says, 23 judges are needed (for lashes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> He learns a Gezerah Shavah "Rasha- Rasha" from Chayavei Misah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding lashes it says "v'Hayah Im Bin Hakos ha'Rasha." Regarding Chayavei Misah it says "Asher Hu Rasha Lamus";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like 23 judges are needed for capital cases, also for lashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Lashes are in place of death (it is like a death penalty).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> If so, why must we estimate how many lashes he can bear? We should lash the full 39, without concern lest he dies!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> "V'Niklah Achicha l'Einecha" - you must strike him when he is your brother (i.e. alive).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If they estimated that he can survive 20 lashes, we lash him only a number divisible by three, i.e. 18.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We should give 21 lashes. Even if he dies on the last, we gave the required number when he was alive!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Niklah Achicha l'Einecha" - even after you strike him, he must still be your brother.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IBUR CHODESH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Meir says, three judges are needed for Ibur Chodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah does not say to <i>consider</i> whether to be Me'aber (add a day to) the month, nor to be Mekadesh (accept testimony of the new moon and declare the 30th day to be the first of the coming) month, rather, <i>Ibur</i> (adding a day);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we were not Mekadesh on the 30th day, the month is automatically Me'ubar! (What do the judges do?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah refers to Kidush ha'Chodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Three judges are needed for Kidush ha'Chodesh and Ibur Shanah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> the Mishnah says <i>Ibur</i> Chodesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Three judges are required to be Mekadesh the new month on the day (that was proper to be) Ibur (added) to the old month (the 30th);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was not Mekudash on this day, no Kidush is required (it is automatically Mekudash the next day).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mishnah is like R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok):</span> If the new moon was not seen in its proper time (the 30th), we are not Mekadesh the new month. Hash-m caused the 31st day to be Mekudash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Nachman):</span> Three judges are required to be Mekadesh the new month after the day (proper to be) Ibur (i.e. Kidush on the 31st);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We are not Mekadesh on the 30th.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mishnah is like Flimo.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Flimo):</span> If the new moon begins on the proper day (i.e. first possible day, the 30th), we are not Mekadesh it; if it begins on the 31st, we are Mekadesh it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ashi):</span> Really, the Mishnah teaches about considering whether to be Me'aber the month;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though it says Ibur Chodesh, this means considering whether to be Me'aber it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It says Ibur Chodesh for parallel structure to the next topic, Ibur Shanah (adding a month to the year).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Ashi explains that our Stam (anonymous) Mishnah requires three judges to consider whether or not to be Me'aber the month, but not for Kidush. Like whom is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Whether the new month begins on the 30th or 31st, we are not Mekadesh it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"V'Kidashtem Es Shenas ha'Chamishim Shanah" - we are Mekadesh years, but not months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> We begin with three...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> We begin with three, we deliberate with five, and the verdict is with seven;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>If one (of the first three) says to sit to deliberate and the other two disagree (they hold that surely, we need not be Me'aber the year), we ignore the lone opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>If two say to sit and one disagrees, we add two more judges.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If two (of these five) say to be Me'aber the year and three disagree, we are not Me'aber;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If three say to be Me'aber the year and two disagree, we add two more judges and Me'aber the year, for at least seven are needed for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we make Batei Din of three, five and seven for Ibur Shanah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yitzchak bar Nachmani or R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> These correspond to the numbers of words in the three verses of Birkas Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (The other of R. Yitzchak bar Nachmani or R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> Three guard the king's gates (or Kelim), five of those who (regularly) see the king (mentioned in Melachim 2:25:19), and seven who see the king (mentioned in Yirmeyahu (52:25) - Tosfos; Rashi - in Esther 1:14).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Rav Yosef taught a Beraisa like Answer #2.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Abaye (to Rav Yosef):</span> Why didn't you explain this way before?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I thought that you knew (since you did not ask);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Did you ever ask something that I didn't answer?</p>
