<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LIABILITY FOR <i>MESIS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Mesis (who is stoned) is a commoner, and one who entices a commoner (to serve idolatry). E.g., he says 'there is an idol in Ploni (a place). It eats and drinks such and such, it rewards and punishes such and such':</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This is the only capital transgression in which witnesses hide in order to trap someone:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven (tries to) entice two men, they are witnesses. They testify in Beis Din to stone him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he entices just Shimon, Shimon should say 'I have friends who would be interested. Tell them also'!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Reuven (understands that Shimon seeks to get witnesses against him and) refuses, Shimon should (in Reuven's absence) tell two witnesses to hide in back of a fence; on the other side, he asks Reuven to repeat what he said before.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>After Reuven repeats it, Shimon asks 'how can we abandon Hash-m, and serve wood and stones?!' If Reuven retracts, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>If Reuven persists 'it is our duty. It is good for us', the witnesses bring him to Beis Din and stone him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One who says any of the following is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'I will serve (idolatry)', 'I will go and serve', or 'let us go serve';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>'I will slaughter (or be Maktir or Menasech or bow to idolatry)', 'I will go and slaughter (or...)', or 'let us go slaughter.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference #1:</span> Mesis (who is stoned) is a commoner who entices, but a Navi who entices is choked.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Inference #2:</span> One who entices an individual is stoned, but one who entices a multitude is choked.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Navi enticed, he is stoned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, he is choked.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Enticers of an Ir ha'Nidachas (a city destroyed because its majority served idolatry) are stoned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Shimon says, they are choked.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa (the next Mishnah, which also discusses those who are stoned)):</span> Medi'ach is one who says 'let us go serve idolatry';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This refers to Medichi Ir ha'Nidachas.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Is the Reisha (our Mishnah) like R. Shimon, and the Seifa is like Chachamim?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Both inferences were wrong. Also the Reisha is like Chachamim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - part 1 of answer (Ravina):</span> (Inference #2 was wrong.) Not only one who entices an individual is stoned, rather, even one who entices a multitude.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Part 2 of answer (Rav Papa):</span> (Inference #1 was wrong.) 'Mesis is a commoner' does not exclude a Navi. Rather, it means that (he is a fool. He need not be warned, rather,) witnesses hide in order to trap him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> Latter clauses of the Mishnah teach bigger Chidushim than the first.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Inference #2 was wrong):</span> Not only one who entices an individual is stoned, rather, even one who entices a multitude;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Inference #1 was wrong):</span> (<i>Any</i>)one who entices a commoner (even a Navi) is stoned, and not only a commoner who entices.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (regarding Inference #1 - Rav Papa):</span> 'Mesis is a commoner' does not exclude a Navi. Rather, it means that witnesses hide in order to trap him (end of Version #2).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This is the only capital transgression in which witnesses hide in order to trap someone. We light a candle in an inner room, and witnesses are in the outer room. They can see and hear the Mesis, but he cannot see them.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Shimon asks Reuven to repeat what he said before. After Reuven repeats it, Shimon asks 'how can we abandon Hash-m, and serve idolatry?!' If Reuven retracts, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>If Reuven persists 'it is our duty. It is good for us', the witnesses bring him to Beis Din and stone him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE PUNISHMENT FOR <i>KISHUF</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Medi'ach is one who says 'let us go serve idolatry.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a Mechashef does an act of Kishuf (witchcraft), he is liable. If he merely tricks people through slight-of- hand, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Akiva says in R. Yehoshua's name, it is possible that two people gather gourds, and one is liable, but the other is exempt:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The one who does an act is liable. The one who does slight-of-hand is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>(Gemara - Rav Yehudah) The Mishnah discusses Medi'ach of an Ir ha'Nidachas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Mechashef is one who does an act.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Mechashefah" - a man or woman is liable for Kishuf;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah discusses a female, because most witches are women.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Misah do they receive?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yosi ha'Galili):</span> It says here "Mechashefah Lo Sechayeh", similar to "Lo Sechayeh Kol Neshamah" (when conquering Eretz Yisrael);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like there we kill by the sword (like we find in the wars against Sichon and Og), also here.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Akiva):</span> It says here "Mechashefah Lo Sechayeh", similar to "Im Behemah Im Ish Lo Yichyeh" (if they ascend Har Sinai);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like there (it explicitly says that) we stone, also here.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi (ha'Galili):</span> My verse ("Lo Sechayeh Kol Neshamah") says "Lo Sechayeh", just like it says regarding Mechashefah. You learned from "Im Behemah...", in which it says "Lo Yichyeh"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> It is better to learn from my verse ("... Im Ish..."), which refers to killing Yisraelim, for whom there are four Misos Beis Din. Your verse discusses Nochrim, who are always killed by the sword!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">67b----------------------------------------67b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ben Azai):</span> After "Mechashefah Lo Sechayeh" it says "Kol Shochev Im Behemah Mos Yumas." Just like bestiality is punishable by stoning, also Kishuf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yehudah):</span> Is the adjacency of the verses sufficient reason to stone a Mechashef?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Yehudah):</span> Ov and Yid'oni are types of Kishuf. The Torah explicitly taught that they are stoned to teach that every Mechashef is stoned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that Ov and Yid'oni are two verses that teach the same thing, so we do not learn from them to other places!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zecharyah):</span> We learn from here that R. Yehudah holds that when two verses teach the same thing, we do learn from them to other places.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>KISHUF</i> AND ACTIONS OF <i>SHEDIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(R. Yochanan) Witchcraft is called Keshafim, an acronym for MaCHchiSHim FaMalya (Shel Ma'alah, it contradicts (nullifies decrees of) the Heavenly Court, e.g. that a certain person should live).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina ):</span> "Ein Od Milvado (there is nothing other than Hash-m)" - even witchcraft (has no power).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A woman was trying to weigh the dirt under R. Chanina's feet (for the sake of Kishuf). He was not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan taught that it contradicts the Heavenly Court!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Chanina was different. Because his merit was so great, it could not affect him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Eibo bar Nigri):</span> Wherever it says b'Lateihem', this refers to actions done through Shedim. 'B'Lahateihem' refers to Kishuf - "v'Es Lahat Cherev ha'Mis'hapeches"(it moved by itself, without Shedim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If the Mechashef is particular about the Keli he uses, he acts through Shedim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he is not particular about the Keli, he does Kishuf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The laws of Kishuf resemble the laws of Shabbos. Some actions are punished by stoning, some are forbidden but one is exempt, and others are permitted:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who does an act is stoned. Slight-of-hand is forbidden, but one is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One may do like R. Chanina and R. Oshiya;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Every Erev Shabbos they would use Sefer Yetzirah to create a calf, and eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> I saw Karna's father (a Mechashef) blow his nose. Silk came out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Va'Yomru ha'Chartumim (about the plague of lice)... Etzba Elokim Hi" - Paro's Mechashfim recognized that it was not done through Shedim, because Shedim cannot create anything smaller than a barley seed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> They cannot create anything at all!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, they can <i>gather</i> things bigger than a barley seed, but not what is smaller.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> I saw an Arab merchant cut up a camel. He banged on a bell, and it got up!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> You did not see blood afterwards. It was only slight-of-hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Ze'iri went to Alexandria of Mitzrayim. He bought (what he thought was) a donkey. When he gave it to drink, the Kishuf ceased, and it reverted to a piece of wood. He requested a refund.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The sellers:</span> We will refund your money (due to your stature). We would not do so for others. In this city, a buyer should know to test the merchandise with water, lest it is made through Kishuf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Yanai (a Mechashef) went to an inn. He asked for water, and they gave to him Shesisah (water with flour). He saw that the lips of the woman who served him were moving. (He suspected that she was doing Kishuf.) He spilled some on the floor, and it became scorpions.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Yanai:</span> Likewise, I will give to you to drink! She drank, and turned into a donkey. He rode on her in the market, until one of her friends saw this and negated his Kishuf, and she reverted to a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Va'Ta'al ha'Tzefarde'a (singular) va'Tchas Es Eretz Mitzrayim" - one frog came up, and it gave birth to hordes of frogs that covered Mitzrayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>This is like R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> One frog came up, it (gave birth to hordes of frogs that) covered Mitzrayim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer ben Azaryah:</span> Apply yourself to (the very difficult) laws of Tzara'as and Tum'as Ohel, but not to Agada!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, one frog came up, and it called to all the frogs in the world. They came and covered Mitzrayim.</p>
