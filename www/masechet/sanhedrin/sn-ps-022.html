<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE LANGUAGE AND WRITING OF THE TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the new writing called Ashuris?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Yisraelim exiled to Ashur brought it with them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> At first the Torah was given in Ashuris. After Yisrael sinned, it was changed to Ro'atz (crushed, i.e. forgotten. The Yerushalmi connotes that Ro'atz is Ivri writing.) After they repented, it was returned to Ashuris - "Shuvu l'Vitzaron (to your former glory)"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is called Ashuris because it is the most glorious writing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, "Vovei ha'Amudim" - just like the Amudim (poles on which the parchment is wound) did not change, the Vovim (the letters, i.e. the writing) did not change.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>(Another proof is) "ki'Chsavam vechi'Lshonam" - just like the language did not change, the writing did not change.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "Mishnah ha'Torah ha'Zos"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that he writes two Sifrei Torah for himself. One he takes with him, and the other he stores away;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The one he takes with him he hangs on his arm - "Shivisi Hash-m l'Negdi Tamid."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The other opinion expounds this like Rav Chanah bar Bisna.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chanah bar Bisna):</span> One who prays must picture the Shechinah in front of him - "Shivisi Hash-m l'Negdi Tamid."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Shimon, the writing did not change. What do we learn from "Lo cha'Halin Kisva"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> The message (written at Belshatzar's party) was written in At-Bash (in place of each letter is substituted the opposite letter of the Aleph-Beis, i.e. Tov for Aleph, Shin for Beis...); it said 'Yatas Yatas Idach Pugchamat';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Daniel explained, it means 'Menei Menei Tekel u'Farsin' - Hash-m calculated that your kingship did not yet finish its allotted time. It is being taken from you for a punishment. It will be split among the kingdoms of Peras and Madai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> The first, fourth, seventh... letters of the (true) message ("Menei Menei..") were made into one word (Mimsos), and likewise for the second, fifth... letters, and the third, sixth ... letters. Hash-m wrote 'Mimsos Nenakfei A'alran.' (Daniel explained that it should be read 'Menei Menei...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> Every word was written backwards - 'Anam Anam Lekes Nisrefu.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ashi):</span> The first two letters of every word were switched - 'Nemei Nemei Ketel Poresin.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>USING WHAT A KING USED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may not ride on a king's horse, nor sit on his throne, or use his scepter;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We may not see him when he takes a haircut or is naked or in the bathhouse - "Som Tasim Alecha Melech", you must fear him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Yakov):</span> Avishag (the girl picked for David) was permitted to Shlomo, for a king may use what another king used;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She was forbidden to Adoniyahu, for he was not a king.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was her relationship with David?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Va'Tehi la'Melech Sochenes va'Tesharesehu."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She asked David to marry her; he told her that he may not take a 19th wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Avishag:</span> That is a lame excuse! (Really, you are too old and weak to have Bi'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Va'Tavo Bas Sheva El ha'Melech ha'Chedrah" - David called Bas Sheva, and she cleaned herself 13 times (there are 13 words in this verse. Rashi - this was after Bi'ah; Ramah - she desired David so much, she emitted his semen from their last Bi'ah) in front of Avishag.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE TIE TO ONE'S FIRST WIFE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shemen bar Aba):</span> This teaches how terrible divorce is! They permitted David (because he was weak) to be secluded with a woman (which was forbidden after the incident with Amnon), but they did not permit him to divorce one of his wives (in order to marry Avishag).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> If one divorces his first wife, even the Mizbe'ach cries over this - "Mizbach Hash-m Bechi va'Anakah... Eshes Ne'urecha Asher Atah Bogadta Bah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> A man's wife dies only if he cannot pay what he owes (Rashi - what he stole; Tosfos - Korbanos that he vowed to bring) - "Im Ein Lecha Leshalem Lamah Yikach Mishkavcha mi'Tachtecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a man's first wife dies, it is as if the Mikdash was destroyed in his lifetime - "Hineni Loke'ach Mimecha Es Machmad Eineicha... va'Tamas Ishti... Hineni Mechalel Es Mikdashi Machmad Eineichem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Alexandri):</span> If a man's wife dies, the world darkens for him - "Or Chashach b'Ahalo."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> His steps get shorter - "Yetzeru Tza'adei Ono."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> His counsel will not succeed - "v'Sachlichehu Atzaso."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Matchmaking is as difficult as splitting the Yam Suf - "Elokim Moshiv Yechidim Baysah Motzi Asirim b'Kosharos",</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Yehudah taught that 40 days before a fetus is formed, a voice from Heaven announces 'Bas Ploni will marry Almoni!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to one's first match, Rabah bar bar Chanah discusses a second match.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachman):</span> There is a substitute for everything except for the wife of one's youth - "v'Eshes Ne'urim Ki Sima'es (even if he despises her, he will return to love her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One feels contented only with his first wife - "...u'Smach me'Eshes Ne'urecha."</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(His son) Rav Yitzchak:</span> What is an example of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> Your mother is an example.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Yehudah told Yitzchak 'your mother illustrates "u'Motzi Ani Mar mi'Maves Es ha'Ishah"!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She is harsh, but she forgives easily.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Onya):</span> A woman is like an unfinished Keli, she makes a covenant with the one (her first husband) who makes her a finished Keli - Ki Vo'alayich Osayich."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When a woman dies, it is as if only her husband is bereaved - "Mesah Alai Rachel."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHEN KOHANIM CUT THEIR HAIR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may not see him...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A king cuts his hair every day, a Kohen Gadol every Erev Shabbos, and a regular Kohen once in 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A king cuts his hair every day due to "Melech b'Yafyo Techezenah Einecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachman):</span> A Kohen Gadol cuts his hair every Erev Shabbos to look nice for the new Mishmar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A regular Kohen cuts his hair once in 30 days due to "...u'Fera Lo Yishalechu Kasom Yichsemu Es Rosheihem";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn a Gezerah Shavah "Pera-Pera" from Nazir. It says here "u'Fera Lo Yishalechu", and it says there "Gadel Pera Se'ar Rosho." Just like there it means 30 days of growth, also here.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one accepted Nezirus without specifying the term, he is a Nazir for 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Masnah):</span> It says "Kadosh Yihyeh" - the Gematri'a of "Yihyeh" is 30.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> We should say that he may not grow his hair at all!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Had it said 'Lo Yishalechu Pera', that would be correct;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, it says "u'Fera Lo Yishalechu." They may have Pera (30 days growth). They may not have more.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also nowadays Kohanim should be commanded to cut their hair every 30 days!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "u'Fera Lo Yishalechu", followed by (Yechezkeil 44:21) "v'Yayin Lo Yishtu... b'Vo'am". Just like the Isur to drink wine applies only when Kohanim enter the Mikdash, also the Isur to grow long hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Drinking wine is forbidden even nowadays, when they do not enter the Mikdash!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> I say that a Kohen should be forbidden to drink wine today (in order that he will be able to serve if the Mikdash will suddenly be rebuilt);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, after the Churban we are not concerned, and he may drink at any time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Nowadays, Kohanim drink wine. This is like Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Chachamim forbid them to drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> This is so that they will be ready to serve if the Mikdash is suddenly rebuilt. For the same reason they should be obligated to cut their hair every 30 days!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If the Mikdash is suddenly rebuilt, a long- haired Kohen could cut his hair and serve.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Likewise, a drunk Kohen could nap and serve (yet Chachamim forbid them to drink)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Rav Acha) Walking a Mil (2000 Amos) or any amount of sleep negates the effects of wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Nachman taught that that is for one who drank only one Revi'is. If he drank more, walking or sleep will worsen his condition!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Shtuyei Yayin (serving when drunk) is Mechalel (disqualifies) the Avodah, therefore Chachamim decreed about it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Pru'ei Rosh (serving with long hair) does not Mechalel Avodah, therefore Chachamim did not decree about it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The following are Chayav Misah: Pru'ei Rosh and Shtuyei Yayin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We know the source for Shtuyei Yayin - "Yayin v'Shechar Al Tesht... v'Lo Samusu";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for Pru'ei Rosh?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is equated to Shtuyei Yayin (they are written adjacently). Just like Shtuyei Yayin is Chayav Misah, also Pru'ei Rosh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Likewise, we should equate them and say that Pru'ei Rosh is also Mechalel Avodah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> How did we know the law before Yechezkeil said these verses?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rav Ashi):</span> "Kol Ben Nechar Erel Lev v'Erel Basar Lo Yavo El Mikdashi" (a Rasha or Arel may not enter the Mikdash). How did we know the law before Yechezkeil?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions (Rav Ashi):</span> You must say that it was a tradition from Sinai. Yechezkeil wrote a verse alluding to it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHEN KOHANIM CUT THEIR HAIR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "Kasom Yichsemu Es Rosheihem"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> It is a Lulainis haircut.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> A unique haircut.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is it done?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The end of one hair reaches to the root of the next hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabanan):</span> How did the Kohen Gadol cut his hair?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rebbi):</span> Look at Ben El'asha (my son-in-law).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Ben El'asha did not squander his money for naught (to learn this haircut). He did so to demonstrate the haircut of the Kohen Gadol.</p>
