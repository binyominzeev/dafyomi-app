<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW MANY JUDGES ARE NEEDED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Monetary cases require three judges; cases of theft and wounds (hitting someone) require three judges. Cases of damage, half-damage, double payment (of a thief), payment of four or five (if he slaughtered or sold a Kosher Behemah) require three.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rape or enticement of a virgin Na'arah (a girl less than six months after becoming Bas Mitzvah), and Motzi Shem Ra (one who claimed that his Kalah was not a virgin) require three judges;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, 23 are needed for Motzi Shem Ra, for sometimes it is a capital case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Cases of lashes require three;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yishmael says, they require 23.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Meir says, three judges are needed for Ibur Chodesh or Ibur Shanah (to add a day to the month or a month to the year);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, we begin Ibur Shanah with three, we deliberate with five, and the verdict is with seven;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If three judges gave a verdict to make an Ibur Shanah, it is Me'uberes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Shimon says, three judges are needed for Semichah of judges (leaning on a Korban for a mistake of the Great Sanhedrin; alternatively, ordination), and for the Eglah Arufah (a calf beheaded for atonement when a murdered corpse is found);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Yehudah says, five are needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Three judges are needed for Chalitzah, Mi'un, redemption of Ma'aser Sheni or Neta Reva'i whose value is not known, or of Hekdesh, and Erchin ha'Metaltelim (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Yehudah says, one of them must be a Kohen;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Redemption of land or a person needs a Kohen and nine other people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Capital cases require 23 judges;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>If an animal slept with a man or woman, 23 judges are needed - "v'Haragta Es ha'Ishah v'Es ha'Behemah" (if it slept with a woman), "v'Es ha'Behemah Taharogu" (if it slept with a man);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An animal that is stoned (e.g. for killing a Yisrael) requires 23 judges - "ha'Shor Yisakel v'Gam Be'alav Yumas" - the animal is killed like its owner (would be killed if he was Chayav Misah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Twenty-three judges are needed to kill a wolf, lion, bear, leopard, Bardelus (panther?), or snake;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>R. Eliezer says, anyone who kills one of these (without Beis Din) did a Mitzvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>R. Akiva says, 23 judges are needed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THINGS THAT REQUIRE 71 JUDGES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Seventy-one judges are needed to judge a Shevet (tribe) (this will be explained), a false Navi, or a Kohen Gadol;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Seventy-one judges are needed to decide to go to an optional war;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Seventy-one judges are needed to add to Yerushalayim or the Azaros (courtyards of the Mikdash);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Seventy-one judges are needed to establish a Sanhedrin for a Shevet;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Seventy-one judges are needed to make an Ir ha'Nidachas (a city destroyed because its majority served idolatry);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not make an Ir ha'Nidachas near the border of Eretz Yisrael. We do not make three of them (even not near the border), but we may make one or two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The Great Sanhedrin has 71 judges. A small Sanhedrin has 23;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn (about a Great Sanhedrin) from "Esfah Li Shiv'im Ish", and Moshe was the head;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, there are only 70.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We learn about a small Sanhedrin from "v'Shaftu ha'Edah... v'Hitzilu ha'Edah" - there is an Edah (congregation) Mechayev (incriminating), and an Edah Mezakeh (vindicating);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that an Edah is (at least) 10?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "La'Edah ha'Ra'ah ha'Zos" refers to the 10 Meraglim other than Yehoshua and Kalev.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches only 20 judges. How do we learn another three?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Lo Siheyeh Acharei Rabim Lera'os", but you may follow a majority to acquit;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "Acharei Rabim Lehatos"?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We follow a majority to convict, but it is different from the majority to acquit. A majority of one (judge who decides to acquit) suffices to acquit, but we need a majority of two to convict.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>(In order to convict against an Edah that acquits, 12 judges must convict.) W do not make a Beis Din with an even number of judges, therefore, 23 are required.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How many people must there be in a city to qualify it to have a Sanhedrin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It needs 120 (23 judges, 69 Talmidim,... - 17b).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Nechemyah):</span> It needs 230, corresponding to judges of 10 (i.e. each judge on the Sanhedrin could be a judge over 10 people of the city).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ADMISSIONS AND LOANS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Cases of theft or wounds are monetary cases! (Why are they listed separately?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Avahu):</span> The Mishnah teaches monetary cases, then gives examples, i.e. theft and wounds;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It omits admissions and loans (witnesses heard Reuven admit that he owes Shimon, or they saw a loan).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Mishnah had to teach monetary cases, and also theft or wounds.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only monetary cases, one might have thought that this includes admissions and loans. Therefore, it had to teach theft and wounds, to exclude admissions and loans;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only theft and wounds, one might have thought that the same applies to admissions and loans, and the Tana taught theft and wounds because regarding them the Torah taught about three judges.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Regarding (a watchman suspected of) theft, it says "v'Nikrav... El <i>ha'Elohim</i>." (This means Mumchim (expert judges), and it is written three times in the Parshah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Reasoning teaches that wounds are like theft. Striking a person is like striking his money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah teaches monetary cases, and gives theft and wounds for examples. Why were admissions and loans omitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Admissions and loans do not require three judges.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Avahu taught that all agree that if two judged a monetary case, the verdict is invalid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They were omitted because admissions and loans do not require Mumchim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Avahu say that Eruv Parshiyos (words in a Parshah teach about a different Parshah) applies here?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it does (i.e. "Ki Hu Zeh... ha'Elohim" written here really applies to loans), we should require Mumchim also for admissions and loans!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Eruv Parshiyos does not apply here, admissions and loans should not require three judges!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, Eruv Parshiyos applies here. The reason we do not require Mumchim is similar to R. Chanina's teaching;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> Mid'Oraisa, we must interrogate witnesses for monetary cases just like for capital cases - "Mishpat Echad Yihyeh Lachem."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is an enactment not to interrogate witnesses in monetary cases, lest this discourage loans (people would be afraid to lend, lest the witnesses err and be disqualified. Similarly, the need for Mumchim discourages loans, for it makes it hard for lenders to collect.)</p>
