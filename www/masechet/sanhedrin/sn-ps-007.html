<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN DO WE SUGGEST COMPROMISE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the first Tana (who said that after (Tosfos - you know) the verdict, the judge may not suggest compromise. This implies that before this, he may!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehoshua ben Korchah says that it is a Mitzvah to suggest compromise. The first Tana says that this is optional.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The first Tana is like R. Shimon ben Menasya (who said that until you sense what the verdict will be, you may suggest compromise)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first Tana argues. He allows compromise even after you sense what the verdict will be, until (Tosfos - you know) the final verdict.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The above Tana'im argue with R. Tanchum bar Chanilai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Tanchum bar Chanilai):</span> "U'Votze'a Berech Ni'etz Hash-m" refers to the golden calf;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yar Aharon va'Yiven Mizbe'ach Lefanav" - what did he see?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> He saw Chur (the son of Miryam and Kalev), and va'Yiven mi'Zavu'ach (understood from the one slaughtered) that if he protests, they will kill him also, fulfilling "Im Yehareg b'Mikdash Hash-m Kohen v'Navi", and then there will be no atonement for Bnei Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>He reasoned 'it is better that they make the calf. Perhaps Teshuvah will help.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>What do the Tana'im (who argue with R. Shimon ben Menasya) learn from "Poter Mayim Reishis Madon"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They learn Rav Hamnuna's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> One is first judged (in the world to come) about his Torah learning - "Poter Mayim Reishis Madon."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> A dispute is like a water conduit. If it is not plugged up immediately, it overflows.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye Kashisha):</span> It is like planks on a bridge. With time, they become fixed (also, a dispute gets stronger).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE ADVANTAGES OF SHALOM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A certain man (Tuvya) used to say 'because I hear people abuse me and keep quiet, I am exempted from misfortunes.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> "Poter Mayim Reishis <i>Madon</i>" - one who begins a dispute initiates 100 judgments (Me'ah DiNim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A certain man used to say 'it is common that one is not punished (immediately) for two or three transgressions.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> "...Al Sheloshah Pish'ei Yisrael v'Al Arba'ah Lo Ashivenu" (the fourth will not be pardoned).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A certain man used to say 'a peaceable person will be saved from seven pits, and a Rasha will fall in the first.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> We learn this from "Ki Sheva Yipol Tzadik va'Kam u'Rsha'im Yikashelu v'Ra'ah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A certain man used to say 'if Beis Din took one's garment, he should rejoice (he was saved from sin).'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> We learn this from "(if you will appoint judges) ha'Am ha'Zeh... Yavo v'Shalom."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>A certain man used to say 'when a weaver naps, her basket drops from her head (and people do not know her trade).'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> We learn this from "ba'Atzaltayim Yimach ha'Mekareh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>A certain man used to say 'the one I relied on raised his hand (Aruch - his weapon) against me.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> We learn this from "Gam Ish Shlomi Asher Botachti Bo (tried to kill me)"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>A certain man used to say 'when I was close with my wife, we could both fit on the blade of a sword. Now that our love has waned, a bed 60 Amos wide does not suffice.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> We learn this from the Mishkan - "v'Dibarti Itecha me'Al ha'Kapores";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Aron was nine Tefachim tall, and the Kapores (its cover) was one Tefach thick;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Shlomo built (the Beis ha'Mikdash)... u'Sheloshim Amah Komaso." After Yisrael sinned, the Shechinah did not dwell there - "..ha'Shamayim Kis'i Ei Zeh Vayis Asher Tivnu Li."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that 'Saguru' means gathering?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> "V'Yayin Lo Sishteh v'Lo Se'egor."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> "Tachin ba'Kayitz Lachmah Agrah ba'Katzir Ma'achalah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> "Oger ba'Kayitz Ben Maskil."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE PERILS OF MISTAKEN JUDGMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> A judge who gives the true verdict causes the Divine Presence to rest in Yisrael - "Elokim Nitzav ba'Adas Kel."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A judge who does not give the true verdict causes the Divine Presence to depart from Yisrael - "mi'Shod Aniyim...  Atah Akum Yomar Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> If a judge that takes from one and gives to another improperly, Hash-m takes his soul - "Al Tigzal Dal... v'Kova Es Kov'eihem Nafesh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> A judge should imagine that a sword is between his thighs and an opening to Gehinom is below him - "mi'Giborei Yisrael... Melumedei Milchamah (Chachamim, skilled in Torah)... mi'Pachad ba'Leilos", from the fear of Gehinom, which is like night.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yoshiyah):</span> Why does it say "Beis David... Dino la'Boker Mishpat"? The whole day is proper for judgment, and not just the morning!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One should not give the verdict until it is as clear to you like morning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> We learn this from "Emor la'Chachmah Achosi At" - do not give the verdict until it is as clear to you as your sister (that she is forbidden to you).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> If 10 judges judge together and err, all will be punished.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is, even a Talmid (who sees that his Rebbi is erring and remains silent) will be punished.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>When Rav Huna would judge, he would gather 10 Chachamim with him, so he would not bear the punishment alone if he errs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>When Rav Ashi would rule about a Treifah, he would gather all the butchers of his city, so he would not bear the punishment alone if he errs.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>APPOINTMENT OF JUDGES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> "Melech b'Mishpat Ya'amid Aretz v'Ish Terumos Yehersenah" - if a judge is financially independent (R. Chananel; Rashi - expert in the laws), like a king who does not need anyone else, he will establish order in the land;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he is like a Kohen who goes to the granaries to get Terumah, he will destroy the land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Nasi's house appointed an unlearned judge.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Yehudah bar Nachmani was asked to say loudly (for all to hear) what the judge would say. The judge said nothing, so Yehudah expounded:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Hoy Omer la'Etz ha'Kitzah" - Hash-m will punish those who appointed him - "va'Shem b'Heichal Kodesho Hass Mipanav Kol ha'Aretz" (this transgression can destroy the world).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Appointing an unlearned judge is like planting an Asheirah. It says "Shofetim v'Shoterim Titen Lecha", followed by "Lo Sita Lecha Asheirah Kol Etz."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Appointing an unlearned judge when Chachamim are available is like planting an Asheirah next to the Altar. We learn from "...Asheirah... Etzel Mizbach Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Lo Sa'ason Iti Elohei Kesef v'Eilohei Zahav" - are wooden idols permitted?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> 'Gold and silver' teach about Elohim (judges) who paid gold or silver to be appointed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>When Rav would go to judge, he would say (about himself) 'do I accept liability to die (if I err), without commanding about my estate, and I receive no gain from this?! May Hash-m help me to return guiltless, like I came!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When he would see people following him, he would say (to refrain from thoughts of pride) "Im Ya'aleh la'Shamayim Si'o...  k'Gelelo la'Netzach (his end is to rot like excrement)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>When Mar Zutra Chasida taught laws of the festival before the festival, people would carry him on their shoulders (to hurry him to his place, to minimize the time that Talmidim must stand for him). He would say "Ki Lo l'Olam Chosen v'Im Nezer l'Dor Dor (wealth will not last forever)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Bar Kapara):</span> What is the source (for the Mishnah) 'be deliberate in judgment'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Bar Kapara):</span> It says "Lo Sa'aleh v'Ma'alos", followed by "v'Eleh ha'Mishpatim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> What is the source that even judges should not (walk above where people are seated, appearing to) walk above the heads of Yisrael?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> It says "Lo Sa'aleh v'Ma'alos", followed by "v'Eleh ha'Mishpatim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the verse continue "Asher <i>Tasim</i>"? It should say 'Telamdem (you will teach)'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> This comes to include judges' tools.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When Rav Huna went to judge, he would request a staff (for lashes mid'Rabanan), a leather strap (for lashes mid'Oraisa), a shofar (for Niduy, i.e. excommunication), and a shoe (for Chalitzah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Va'Atzaveh Es Shofteichem" - judges should be zealous to use the staff and strap to instill fear in the congregation (for the sake of Heaven).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> "Shamo'a Bein Acheichem u'Shfatetem Tzedek" - Beis Din may not hear one party before the other party comes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Shamo'a" can be read 'Shma', warning a litigant not to present his case before the other party comes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> We learn this from "Lo Tisa (Shema Shav)" (do not <i>receive</i> a false report). We read this as if it said 'Lo Tasi' (do not <i>give</i>).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "U'Shfatetem Tzedek" - reach the correct law, then enact it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> (The verse continues) "Bein Ish u'Vein Achiv" - even between brothers dividing a house and its second story (award compensation to the one receiving the second story).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"U'Vein Gero" - award compensation even between different types of ovens (Rashi; Aruch - ensure that each oven is kept the proper distance from the floor and ceiling, so it will not damage).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>JUDGING FRIENDS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "Lo <i>Sakiru</i> Panim ba'Mishpat" - do not show favoritism to your friend;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Do not Misnaker (estrange, i.e. obligate) your enemy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A man said to Rav 'do you remember that I hosted you'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> Yes.</p>
