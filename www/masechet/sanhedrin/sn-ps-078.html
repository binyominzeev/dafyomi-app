<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LIABILITY OF AND FOR A TREIFAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If 10 men hit Reuven, each with a different stick, and he died, whether they hit him at the same time or one after the other, they are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah ben Beseira says, if they hit him one after the other, the last one is liable, for he made him die sooner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Both of them expound the same verse, "v'Ish Ki Yakeh Kol Nefesh Adam";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, "Kol Nefesh" connotes that he kills the entire Nefesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah ben Beseira says, "Kol Nefesh" connotes any amount of a Nefesh (even if he was going to die).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> All agree that one who kills a Treifah is exempt (he was already mortally wounded. The murderer merely quickened his death);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All agree that one who kills a Goses b'Yedei Shamayim (a sick person who will probably die) is liable (his body was intact).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue about a Goses b'Yedei Adam (a wounded person who will probably die). Chachamim consider him like a Treifah, and R. Yehudah considers him like a Goses b'Yedei Shamayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim consider him like a Treifah, for he is injured;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yehudah considers him like a Goses b'Yedei Shamayim, for his vital organs are intact (unlike a Treifah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(A reciter of Beraisos):</span> "V'Ish Ki Yakeh Kol Nefesh" includes if Reuven hits Shimon not hard enough to kill him, and Levi killed him. Levi is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If Reuven did not hit him hard enough to kill him, obviously Levi is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Reuven hit him hard enough to kill him, and Levi is liable. This Stam (anonymous) Beraisa is like R. Yehudah ben Beseira.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One who kills a Treifah is exempt. If a Treifah killed someone, he is liable only if it was in front of Beis Din;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In front of Beis Din he is liable due to "u'Vi'arta ha'Ra mi'Kirbecha" (testimony is not needed);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Not in front of Beis Din he is exempt because the testimony cannot be Huzam. (We could not kill witnesses for trying to kill a Treifah.) Such testimony is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One who is Rove'a (has Mishkav Zachar with) a Treifah is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Treifah is Rove'a in front of Beis Din. he is liable, due to "u'Vi'arta ha'Ra mi'Kirbecha";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a Treifah is Rove'a not in front of Beis Din he is exempt, because the testimony cannot be Huzam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must Rava teach this in addition to his previous teaching?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He needed to teach the case of one who is Rove'a a Treifah. One might have thought that this is like Bi'ah with a dead person (which is exempt);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava teaches that this is not so. Since he enjoys the act, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If witnesses testified about a Treifah and they were Huzmu, they are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Treifah witnesses were Huzmu, they are killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rebuttal (Rav Ashi):</span> Also Treifah witnesses who were Huzmu are not killed, because the testimony of the Mezimim (who said that the witnesses were somewhere else) cannot be Huzam (we could not kill healthy Mezimim for trying to kill Treifos. A very small minority of people are Tereifos, so we do not say that the testimony could be Huzam, i.e. through Tereifah Mezimim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a Treifah ox gored, it is killed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the ox of a Treifah person gored, it is not killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ha'Shor Yisakel v'Gam Be'alav Yumas" - an animal is killed only if its owner would have been killed (had he killed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Even if a Treifah ox gored, it is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since its owner would not be killed (if he were a Treifah), it is not killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he incited a dog...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> R. Yehudah holds that a snake's venom rests in its tooth. Therefore, one who sticks its tooth into a person directly killed him, he is liable, and the snake is not killed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah holds that a snake bites and then injects venom. Therefore, the snake is killed. The person was only a Gorem, so he is not killed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SOMEONE CRITICALLY WOUNDED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven hit Shimon with his fist or a rock, and Beis Din assessed that Shimon will (probably) die:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon improved, but then worsened and died, Reuven is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Nechemyah exempts, due to Raglayim l'Davar (circumstantial evidence that he did not hit him hard enough to kill him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Nechemyah) Question:</span> "Im Yakum v'His'halech ba'Chutz Al Mish'anto v'Nikah ha'Makeh" - would we think that the victim (Shimon) walks in the market, and the one who struck him (Reuven) is killed?!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">78b----------------------------------------78b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, Beis Din assessed that Shimon will die. He improved, then worsened and died. The verse exempts Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim learn from this verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that we imprison Reuven until we see whether Shimon will die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Nechemyah's source to imprison Reuven?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He learns from the Mekoshesh (the one who gathered wood on Shabbos in the Midbar. He was locked up, and later killed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't Chachamim learn from the Mekoshesh?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was locked up because he was surely Chayav Misah, but Moshe did not know which Misas Beis Din;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We cannot learn from there that we lock up someone if we do not know if he will be Chayav Misah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Nechemyah learns (to imprison) from the Megadef (blasphemer);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He was locked up even though Moshe did not know whether or not he was Chayav Misah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Chachamim do not learn from the Megadef because it was a Hora'as Sha'ah (a special enactment needed at the time).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Moshe knew that the Mekoshesh was Chayav Misah - "Mechaleleha Mos Yumas";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He did not know which Misas Beis Din - "Ki Lo Forash";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Moshe locked up the Megadef, even though Moshe did not know whether or not he was Chayav Misah - "Lifrosh Lahem Al Pi Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Nechemyah, we understand why the Torah writes two extra phrases ("v'Lo Yamus" and "Im Yakum v'Hishalech ba'Chutz"), to teach about two cases in which we assessed Shimon to die, yet we do not kill Reuven:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shimon later recovered;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shimon improved and later worsened and died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>However, what do Chachamim (who are Mechayev in the latter case) learn from the two verses?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They teach that Reuven is exempt whether we assessed Shimon to die and he lived, or whether we assessed Shimon to live and he died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Nechemyah does not need a verse for the latter. Once Beis Din (assesses that he will live and) exempts Reuven, they can never be Mechayev him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Nechemyah):</span> If Reuven struck Shimon and we assessed Shimon to die and he lived, Reuven is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we assessed him to die and he improved, we make a second assessment for payment of damages;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Shimon later dies, Reuven pays (the heirs) according to the second assessment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, the second assessment does not override the first. (Since we first assessed him to die, if he eventually dies from the blow, Reuven is killed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> If we assessed him to die (and he improves), we can later assess that he will live;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we assessed him to live (and he worsened), we do not later assess that he will die (from the blow).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If we assessed him to die and he improves, we later assess payment for the damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he worsened and died, the damager gives the payments for Nezek (the decrease in his earning potential due to the blow) and pain to the heirs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When we assess Nezek, do we consider the victim's state right after the blow, or his state after we assessed that he will live?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We consider his state right after the blow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>This Stam Beraisa is like R. Nechemyah.</p>
