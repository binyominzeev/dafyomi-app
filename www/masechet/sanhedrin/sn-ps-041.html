<p class="dedicationbox">SANHEDRIN 41 (4 Elul) - Dedicated l'Iluy Nishmas Chaim Yisachar (ben Yaakov) Smulewitz of Cleveland on his Yahrzeit, by his daughter and son in law, Jeri & Eli Turkel of Raanana, Israel. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE SOURCE FOR WARNING BEFORE KILLING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Question (Ula) What is the source that warning is required?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula):</span> "V'Ish Asher Yikach Es Achoso... v'Ra'ah Es Ervasah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is he liable for seeing her Ervah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he is liable only if they explained to him the Isur.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Surely, this is not needed for Kares (at the hands of Heaven. Hash-m knows whether he was Mezid or Shogeg), so we use it to teach about lashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (d'Vei Chizkiyah):</span> "V'Chi Yazid... Lehorgo b'Armah" - even after he was warned, he is still Mezid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Ha'Motze'im Oso Mekoshesh Etzim" - even after they warned him, he continued gathering.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (d'Vei Rebbi):</span> "Al <i>Davar</i> Asher Inah" - due to the Dibur (he was told not to).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The Torah needed to teach all these verses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only about a sister, one might have thought that warning is needed for lashes, but not for death penalties;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only about a murderer, one might have thought that warning is needed for death by the sword, but not for stoning;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need two verses about (Shabbos and a Na'arah Me'urasah (an Arusah than six less than six months after becoming Bas Mitzvah), which are both punishable by) stoning?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> According to R. Shimon, who says that burning is more severe, the extra verse teaches about burning;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 2:</span> According to Chachamim, who say that stoning is the most severe, even though we knew burning from a Kal va'Chomer, the Torah wrote a word enabling us to expound it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It would suffice to teach about stoning, and the others (including lashes and the sword) follow from a Kal va'Chomer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here also, even though we knew burning from a Kal va'Chomer, the Torah wrote a word enabling us to expound it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He agreed to be killed for his transgression.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that he must do so?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "Yumas ha'Mes" - he is already called dead, i.e. he agreed to be killed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>KILLING WITHOUT WARNING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chanan):</span> If witnesses testified that a Na'arah Me'orasah was Mezanah, and then they were Huzmu, they are not killed, for they can say 'we did not intend to kill her. We intended only to forbid her to her husband.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Surely they intended to kill her, for) they warned her! (If not, we could not kill her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, they did not warn her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, she cannot be killed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, she is a Chaverah (Chachamah), so she did not need to be warned, according to R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> A Chaver does not need to be warned, for warning is merely to distinguish between Shogeg and Mezid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they cannot be killed, how can she be killed? We cannot apply the law of Hazamah (to do to the witnesses what they sought to do). Such testimony is invalid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, Rav Chanan meant that because the witnesses cannot be killed (for they can say that they did not intend to kill her), she is not killed either (because we cannot apply the law of Hazamah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of a Chaverah who is killed without warning according to R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She was Mezanah twice. (She was already forbidden to her husband after the first time. Surely the second testimony was to kill her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The witnesses can say that they did not intend to kill her, only to forbid her to the second adulterer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> She was Mezanah with the same man both times (she was already forbidden to him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> She was Mezanah (the second time) with a relative (who is forbidden to her in any case).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Rav Chanan teach about a Na'arah Me'orasah? The same applies after Nisu'in!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a bigger Chidush that the witnesses can say that they intended to forbid her to her husband even though she never lived with him yet.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CONTRADICTORY TESTIMONIES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If one witness says that he killed with a sword, and the other says that he used an ax, the testimonies do not match;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one says that his clothes were black, and the other says that they were white, the testimonies join.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "Nachon" - the testimonies must match;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one witness says that he killed with a sword, and the other say that he used an ax, or one says that his clothes were black, and the other says that they were white, these do not match.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> The Beraisa discusses one who choked the victim with his garment. This is crucial to the testimony, just like the sword or ax.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one witness says that his shoes were black, and the other says that they were white, these do not match.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he killed him by kicking him with his sandal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> A case occurred in which Ben Zakai asked them if the figs on the tree had large or small stems (and disqualified the testimony because the witnesses disagreed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rami bar Chama):</span> The case was, he was Chayav Misah for picking a fig on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - Chachamim):</span> He killed him under a fig tree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rami bar Chama):</span> The case was, he killed him with a fig branch.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> (Ben Zakai) asked the witnesses 'did the figs on the tree have small or big stems? Were they white or black?' (even though this is not crucial to the testimony).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> We cannot refute Rav Chisda from Ben Zakai. Ben Zakai treats Bedikos like Chakiros (but Chachamim argue).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is this Ben Zakai?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is R. Yochanan Ben Zakai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He never sat on a Sanhedrin (that judged capital cases)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Yochanan Ben Zakai lived 120 years. He engaged in business for 40 years, he learned for 40 years, and he taught for 40 years.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Forty years before the Churban, the Sanhedrin was exiled to Chanus (a place).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Avdimi):</span> After they exiled themselves, they did not judge fines.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That is unreasonable! (Fines do not depend on the Great Sanhedrin sitting in Lishkas ha'Gazis.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, afterwards they did not judge capital cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> After the Churban R. Yochanan Ben Zakai enacted... (Since he lived after the Churban, the Sanhedrin was exiled <i>more than</i> 40 years before he died, i.e. before he taught. Surely, he was not on the Sanhedrin before he taught!)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He was someone else whose father was named Zakai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> R. Yochanan ben Zakai would not be called Ben Zakai (without any title).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> A case occurred in which R. Yochanan Ben Zakai asked them if the figs on the tree had large or small stems.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It was Yochanan ben Zakai when he was a Talmid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He suggested asking about the figs. Chachamim approved, and it was recorded in his name.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">41b----------------------------------------41b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Our Mishnah calls him Ben Zakai, for he was still learning at the time (he was not yet called Raban, or even Rebbi);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Beraisa calls him R. Yochanan Ben Zakai, for he later became the teacher of Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHAKIROS AND BEDIKOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The difference between Chakiros and Bedikos... (if a witness, or even both witnesses cannot answer Bedikos, their testimony is valid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say <i>even</i> if both witnesses cannot answer? Since one witness need not answer, surely the other need not know either!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> This refers to the Chakiros, e.g. when there are three witnesses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah teaches that even if two witnesses can answer and one cannot, the testimony is disqualified.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is like R. Akiva, who equates three witnesses to two. (Just like if one of two witnesses cannot answer a Chakirah, their testimony is disqualified, also if one of three cannot answer.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> It says 'even if... their testimony <i>stands</i>'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Mishnah means, even regarding Chakiros, if two of three witnesses can answer a Chakirah and one cannot, the testimony (of the two) stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is unlike R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama - Mishnah):</span> If a witness cannot answer a Chakirah, his testimony is disqualified. If a witness, or even both witnesses cannot answer Bedikos, their testimony is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Bedikos are also mid'Oraisa. Why is their law different?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana and Rav Safra):</span> If a witness cannot answer a Chakirah, he cannot be Huzam (since he did not specify when or where he saw the testimony), therefore his testimony is disqualified;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if he cannot answer Bedikos, he can be Huzam.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>A MISTAKE IN THE DAY OF THE MONTH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one witness... (we assume that one of them did not hear that the month was Me'ubar).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How far into the month do we assume this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha bar Chanina):</span> It is until the majority of the month has passed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Support (Rava - Mishnah) If one witness says 'it was the third', and the other says 'it was the fifth', their testimony is disqualified.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not say that the latter did not hear about two Ibur months. We must say that after the majority of the month, everyone knows about the Ibur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps even after the majority of the month, not everyone knows, but people (usually) hear the Shofar used to announce Rosh Chodesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We can say that a person did not hear about one month, but we do not assume he did not hear for two consecutive months.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>UNTIL WHEN MAY ONE SAY KIDUSH LEVANAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Chanina citing R. Yochanan):</span> One may bless on the new moon until its deficiency is filled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yakov bar Idi):</span> It is until seven days after the Molad (new moon).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Chachamim of Neharde'a):</span> It is until the 16th of the month.</p>
