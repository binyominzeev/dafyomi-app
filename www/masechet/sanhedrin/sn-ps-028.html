<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>We have shown that fathers cannot testify for sons, nor sons for fathers, and all the more so fathers (who are brothers) for each other;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that sons (of Reuven) cannot testify for sons (of Reuven's brother)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If they could testify for each other, the Torah would have written 'Lo Yumesu Avos Al <i>Ben</i>';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it wrote "Al <i>Banim</i>", to teach that sons cannot testify for each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>We have shown that sons cannot testify for sons;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that two relatives cannot testify together (about someone else)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rami bar Chama):</span> Reasoning teaches this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Witnesses are not made Zomemim unless both are Huzmu.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If relatives could testify about someone else, they could be killed due to each other's testimony!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava - Mishnah):</span> If David testified about three years of Chazakah, and three brothers testified, each about one of the three years, (this is testimony of Chazakah, for) testimony of each year is separate (the brothers do not testify together);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Hazamah, it is like one testimony (they are exempt unless all of them are Huzmu).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they will be Huzmu, the brothers will pay due to each other's testimony!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that they pay due to the Hazamah, and not due to each other's testimony</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Likewise, if relatives testified together and were Huzmu, they are killed due to the Hazamah, and not due to each other's testimony!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rather, the Torah could have said 'Ben Al Avos' or 'Hem Al Avos';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Instead, it says "u'Vanim" to teach that Banim (i.e. relatives) cannot testify with each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about paternal relatives. What is the source for maternal relatives?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says 'Avos' twice. If we do not need it to teach about paternal relatives, we use it to teach about maternal relatives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches that relatives cannot testify to obligate each other. What is the source that they cannot testify to benefit each other?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says 'Yumesu' twice. We do not need the latter to teach about Chiyuv, so we use it to teach about Zechus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about capital cases. What is the source for monetary cases?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Mishpat Echad Yihyeh Lachem" - the law is the same.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW MANY GENERATIONS ARE DISQUALIFIED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> My paternal uncle cannot testify for me, nor his son or son-in-law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I cannot testify for my uncle, nor can my son or son-in-law testify for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't Rav's son testify for him? The son is a Shelishi (third generation (i.e. grandson) of Rav's father), and the uncle is a Rishon (first generation, i.e. a brother of Rav's father);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah says that a Sheni (e.g. Ploni's son) cannot testify for a Sheni (Ploni's nephew) or a Rishon (Ploni's brother). It does not say that a Shelishi cannot testify for a Rishon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mishnah says '(their sons and) Choseneihem (their sons-in-law)', i.e. the sons-in-law <i>of the sons</i> (of the relatives listed above), i.e. a Shelishi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't the Mishnah simply teach the grandsons (of these relatives)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> By the way, it teaches that a husband is like his wife (he may not testify about anyone disqualified to testify about her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Chiya taught that there are eight primary relatives, (i.e. those in the first clause of the Mishnah), which lead to 24 disqualified relatives. (Before, we understood that the other 16 are the sons and sons-in-law of the eight);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, if 'Choseneihem' means the sons-in-law <i>of their sons</i>, and all the more so their grandsons), there are 24 <i>more</i>, making 32! (We could have said 40, i.e. five for each of the eight relatives - his son, grandson, son-in-law, and son-in-law of the son. Rashi - the son-in-law and son-in-law of the son are counted only like one, since both are in the category of son-in-law. Ri - we do not counts grandsons, for they are not explicit in the Mishnah (we learn from a Kal va'Chomer). Really, some relatives are counted more than once. In any case, it should not say 24.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Indeed, Choseneiheim means (simply) the sons- in-law of the eight;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We called them sons-in-law <i>of the sons</i> of the relatives, because (since a son-in-law is not a man's own child,) he is considered like a third generation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If a son-in-law is like a Shelishi, then the son-in-law of a paternal uncle (one of the eight primary relatives) is like a Shelishi with a Sheni. Rav was Machshir this! (He disqualified a Shlishi only with a Rishon.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rav's law is like R. Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> Just like my paternal uncle, his son and son-in-law cannot testify for me, also the son of my paternal uncle, his son and son-in- law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Still, the grandson of a paternal uncle is a Shelishi with a Sheni, and Rav was Machshir this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav holds like him in one aspect (that a Shelishi is disqualified from testifying), he argues with him in one aspect (Rav disqualifies only a Shelishi with a Rishon. R. Elazar disqualifies even with a Sheni).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rav's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Lo Yumesu Avos Al <i>Banim u'Vanim</i>" comes to include another generation (a grandson (Shelishi) with a Rishon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Elazar learns from "Al Banim" that this Pesul (of a Shelishi) to the father also applies to his children (Sheniyim).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OTHER DISQUALIFIED RELATIVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The brother of my mother-in-law and his son cannot testify for me. The son of my mother-in-law's sister cannot testify for me.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> The husbands of a man's sister and (paternal and maternal) aunts, and their sons and sons- in-law cannot testify for him. (If Ploni is the son (or nephew) of Almoni's mother-in-law, Almoni is the son-in- law of Ploni's sister (or aunt).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> What is the law of the father-in- law's brother and (paternal and maternal) nephews?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula - Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> A brother, a paternal or maternal uncle... and their sons and sons-in-law (are disqualified). (If Ploni is the brother (or nephew) of Almoni's father-in-law, Almoni is the son-in-law of Ploni's brother (or uncle).)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">28b----------------------------------------28b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can Ploni testify about his step-son's wife (Leah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A husband is like his wife (therefore, he is like Leah's mother-in-law); a wife is like her husband (therefore, a mother-in-law is like a father-in-law, i.e. disqualified).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna) Question:</span> What is the source that a wife is like her husband?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer - Question:</span> Why does it say "Ervas Achi Avicha... Ishto... Dodascha Hi"? She is not his aunt. She is his uncle's wife!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that a wife is like her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> His step-father... and his son and son-in-law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> His step-father's son is his (maternal) brother (which was already taught)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> This teaches about (his step- father's son from a different woman, i.e.) the (paternal) brother of his (maternal) brother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rav Chisda ruled that the brother of a brother may testify. He argues with R. Yirmeyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what is the Chidush of the step-father's son?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches about a maternal brother. When the Mishnah said 'brother', it referred to a paternal brother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Ploni's father can testify for Ploni's father-in-law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> A man can testify for his Arusah (betrothed wife).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> This is only to obligate her money, but not to be Mezakeh her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He cannot testify for her at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>They thought that he is not considered a relative, due to R. Chiya bar Ami's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Ami):</span> If an Arusah dies, her husband does not become an Avel (mourner). He is not commanded (if he is a Kohen, he is forbidden) to become Tamei by engaging in her burial. He does not inherit her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he dies, she does not become an Avelah (and she is not commanded to become Tamei. Some delete this from the text), and she collects her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span>Really, one cannot learn from there. Regarding Tum'ah and inheritance it says "Sh'eiro." This is not until Nisu'in;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Disqualification from testimony depends on feeling affinity. He feels this from the time of Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE GIS DISQUALIFIED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A step-son is disqualified, just himself (but not his son or son-in-law).</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A step-son is disqualified, just himself, and (the first Tana (i.e. R. Yehudah, as we see from Beraisa #2) did not teach Giso, but) the same applies to Giso;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yosi teaches that just Giso is disqualified, and (he did not teach a step-son, but) the same applies to a step-son.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, our Mishnah (which disqualifies Giso, his son and his son-in-law) is neither like R. Yehudah nor like R. Yosi!</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps Shmuel meant 'I cannot testify for Pinchas because we are Gisim' (this itself disqualifies).</p>
