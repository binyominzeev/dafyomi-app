<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Tzadikim are greater than angels - "Guvrun Arb'ah... Revi'a'ah Dame l'Var Elahin (the angel is called the fourth, after Chananyah, Misha'el and Azaryah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Tanchum bar Chanilai):</span> When Chananyah, Misha'el and Azaryah left the furnace, all the nations hit Yisraelim on the faces, and said 'you have a G-d who does such miracles for you, and you bowed to the image?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Yisraelim responded by saying "Lecha Hash-m ha'Tzedakah v'Lanu Boshes ha'Panim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> "Omarti E'eleh b'Samar" - Hash-m intended that Yisrael be full of Tzadikim (like a date tree is dull of dates), but "Ochazah b'Sansinav", He only has one branch, i.e. Chananyah, Misha'el and Azaryah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Ra'isi Laylah" - Hash-m wanted to turn the entire world to night (destroy it, because Yisrael bowed to the image);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Al Sus Adom" - Hash-m wanted to turn the entire world to blood. He looked at the act of Chananyah, Misha'el and Azaryah, and was assuaged - "ha'Hadasim (Tzadikim - Esther was called Hadasah) Asher ba'Metzulah (Bavel)... Mele'im Rogez... Na'asim Levanim."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> (Since red horses symbolize a curse,) this shows that white horses are a good sign in a dream.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What happened to Chananyah, Misha'el and Azaryah afterwards?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> They died due to Ayin ha'Ra;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> They drowned in the spit (of Nochrim despising the Yisraelim who had bowed. This is because they were not at a high enough level to make a pure Kidush Hash-m without the negative result for other Yisre'elim - heard from R. C. T. Fogel Shlita.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> They went to Eretz Yisrael, married women and fathered children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Tana'im argue as the Amora'im do.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> They died due to Ayin ha'Ra;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua says, they drowned in spit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, they went to Eretz Yisrael, married women and fathered children - "Yehoshua ha'Kohen ha'Gadol Atah v'Re'echa ha'Yoshevim Lefanecha Ki Anshei Mofes Hemah"</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chananyah, Misha'el and Azaryah are the ones for whom a Mofes (miracle) was done (and now they were in front of the Kohen Gadol, i.e. in Eretz Yisrael).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where had Daniel gone?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> He went to dig and forge a river (some say - to a mountain).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> Nebuchadnetzar had sent him to bring fodder.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> Nebuchadnetzar had sent him to bring pigs from Alexandria (where they are big, in order to raise them in Bavel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Tudus the doctor said that they cut the wombs of all cows and pigs that leave Miztrayim (so they will not reproduce).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He took small ones. The Mitriyim did not think that he took them for breeding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Three parties all wanted Daniel to go - Hash-m, Daniel and Nebuchadnetzar:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m wanted Daniel to go, lest people think that Chananyah, Misha'el and Azaryah were saved in his merit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Daniel wanted to go, for Nebuchadnetzar worshipped him, and he feared lest he himself be burned (for idolatry should be burned) - "Pesilei Eloheihem Tisrefun ba'Esh"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Nebuchadnetzar wanted him to go, lest people say that Nebuchadnetzar burned his own god (Daniel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Nebuchadnetzar worshipped him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Nebuchadnetzar Nafal Al Anpohi ul'Daniel Segid."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FALSE NEVI'IM BURNED IN THE FIRE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>"... Achav ben Kolayah v'El Tzidkiyahu ben Ma'aseyah ha'Nib'im Lachem bi'Shmi Shaker... Asher Kalam Melech Bavel ba'Esh" - It does not say that he burned him, rather, Kalam (roasted);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He parched them like grain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yna'afu Es Neshei Re'eihem" - what did they do?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Achav told Nebuchadnetzar's daughter 'Hashem said that when Tzidkiyahu wants to have Bi'ah with you, consent to him.' Likewise, Tzidkiyahu told her that Hash-m wants her to consent to Achav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She told her father. He said 'their G-d hates sexual immorality. When they come, send them to me.' She did so. They told him that Hash-m commanded them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Nebuchadnetzar:</span> Chananyah, Misha'el and Azaryah said that it is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Achav and Tzidkiyahu:</span> We are also Nevi'im. Hash-m permitted us, but he did not permit them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Nebuchadnetzar:</span> I want to test you, like I tested them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Achav and Tzidkiyahu:</span> They were three, so they had more merit to be saved. We are only two!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Nebuchadnetzar:</span> Pick anyone you want to accompany you!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Achav and Tzidkiyahu:</span> We want Yehoshua the Kohen Gadol (they hoped that his merit would suffice to save them).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>All three of them were thrown in. Achav and Tzidkiyahu were burned, and Yehoshua's garments were singed - "Yehoshua... (Ud Mutzal me'Esh)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Nebuchadnetzar:</span> I see that you (Yehoshua) are a Tzadik. Why did the fire affect you (your garments)? It did not affect Chananyah, Misha'el and Azaryah at all!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Yehoshua:</span> They were three, therefore they had more merit. I was alone (Achav and Tzidkiyahu had no merits.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Nebuchadnetzar:</span> Avraham was thrown into a furnace alone, and he was totally saved!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">Yehoshua:</span> I had Resha'im with me. Since the fire was permitted to kill them, it also affected me;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is like people say, if two dry spits are with a wet one, they will cause it to be burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was Yehoshua punished?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> His sons married women forbidden to Kohanim, and he did not protest - "vi'Hoshua Hayah Lavush Begadim Tzo'im";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would the Kohen Gadol be wearing filthy garments?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, his sons married women forbidden to Kohanim, and he did not protest.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE BLESSINGS OF RUS' DESCENDANTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Tanchum):</span> Why does it say "Shesh ha'Se'orim ha'Eleh Nosan Li"? Surely, Bo'az did not give Rus a mere six barley seeds!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">93b----------------------------------------93b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, he gave to her six Sa'im (a Se'ah is about 12 liters).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A woman does not carry so much!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Indeed, he gave to her six barley seeds. He hinted that six sons will come from her, and each will receive six blessings:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says about David "Yode'a Nagen v'Gibor Chayil v'Ish Milchamah u'Nevon Davar v'Ish To'ar va'Shem Imo";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This entire verse was Lashon ha'Ra (Do'eg praised David to make Sha'ul envy him):</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Yode'a Nagen - he knows how to ask. Gibor - he knows how to answer. Ish Milchamah - he can debate in Torah. Navon - he understands a matter through another matter. Ish To'ar - he brings proof for what he says. Va'Shem Imo - the Halachah always follows him.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Regarding the first five, Sha'ul said 'this is true also about my son Yonason.' Regarding va'Shem Imo, which was not true even about Sha'ul himself, Sha'ul was demoralized and envied him.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that this was true about David, but not about Sha'ul?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding Sha'ul it says "uv'Chol Asher Yifneh Yarshi'a." Regarding David it says "uv'Chol Asher Yifneh Yatzli'ach."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Do'eg is the one who said "Yode'a Nagen..."?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Va'Ya'an Echad meha'Ne'arim" refers to the most special one, "Do'eg ha'Edomi Abir ha'Ro'im."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding Mashi'ach it says "v'Nochah Alav Ru'ach Hash-m Ru'ach Chachmah u'Vinah Ru'ach Etzah u'Gvurah Ru'ach Da'as v'Yir'as Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Alexandri):</span> "<i>Va'Haricho</i> b'Yir'as Hash-m" teaches that Hash-m loaded Mashi'ach with Mitzvos and afflictions like a Reichayim (millstone).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Va'Haricho..." teaches that he is Morach (smells, i.e. senses who is guilty) and judges - "v'Lo l'Mar'e Einav Yishpot... v'Shofat Tzedek."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Bar Koziva ruled for two and a half years, and told Chachamim that he is Mashi'ach. Chachamim tested him. They saw that he cannot judge by 'smell', so they killed him (Ramah - like a false Navi. (Our Gemara argues with the Medrash that Romi killed him.))</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Regarding Daniel, Chananyah, Misha'el and Azaryah it says "Ein Bahem Kol Mum v'Tovei Mar'eh u'Maskilim b'Chol Chachmah v'Yod'ei Da'as u'Mevinei Mada va'Asher Bahem Ko'ach... u'Lelamdam Sefer u'Lshon Kasdim."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "Ein Bahem Kol Mum"?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> They did not even have a wound from bloodletting. (Most people used to let blood regularly.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "va'Asher Bahem Ko'ach La'amod b'Heichal ha'Melech"?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> When in front of the king they would not joke, converse, sleep, or go to relieve themselves, due to fear of the king.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Va'Yhi Bahem mi'Bnei Yehudah Daniel Chananyah, Misha'el va'Azaryah" - all of them are from Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> Daniel is from Yehudah. "Mi'Bnei Yehudah" does not refer to Chananyah, Misha'el and Azaryah. They are from other Shevatim. (Rashi - he argues with Answer #2 above. Rashi assumes that we discuss pure paternal lineage, like for David and Mashi'ach, for Rus could have descendants in other Shevatim through females.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Umi'Banecha... Sarisim b'Heichal Melech Bavel" - what does "Sarisim" refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> It is literal (they were castrated).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chanina):</span> Idolatry was castrated in their days (the Yetzer ha'Ra for it was abolished).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Chanina, we understand "va'Chaval Lo Isi Behon (they have no blemish)." According to Rav, they were blemished!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse teaches that the fire made no mark on them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already know this from "v'Re'ach Nur Lo Adas Behon"! (Even the smoke of the fire did not impart a smell to them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verses teach that the fire made no mark and the smoke did not leave a smell.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Chanina, "la'Sarisim Asher Yishmeru Es Shabsosai" is not derogatory;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, according to Rav, why does the verse speak this way about Tzadikim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that they were castrated <i>and</i> idolatry was castrated in their days. "La'Sarisim..." refers to castration of idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav, we understand "...Yad va'Shem Tov mi'Banim umi'Banos" (for they cannot have children). How does R. Chanina understand this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It will be better than the children they had, who already died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "Shem Olam Eten Lo Asher Lo Yikares"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Tanchum):</span> This is Sefer Daniel, which is called by his name.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHY SEFER EZRA IS NOT ATTRIBUTED TO NECHEMYAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Nechemyah wrote most of Sefer Ezra. Why wasn't it called by his name?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmeyah bar Aba):</span> It is because he took credit for himself - "Zochrah Li Elokai l'Tovah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this called crediting himself? Also David said "Zochreni Hash-m... Pokdeni bi'Shu'asecha"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> David was asking for mercy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> It is because he denigrated the earlier leaders - "veha'Pachos ha'Rishonim Asher Lefanai Hichbidu Al ha'Am...";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He criticized even Daniel, who was greater than himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Daniel was greater than Nechemyah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Ra'isi Ani Daniel... veha'Anashim Asher Hayu Imadi Lo Ra'u";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who were the people with Daniel?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> They were Chagai, Zecharyah and Malachi. (Daniel was greater than Nevi'im. All the more so he was greater than Nechemyah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>[In this respect, Daniel was greater than them. In another respect, they were greater than him, for they were Nevi'im, and he was not. Most texts delete this (Rashi).]</p>
