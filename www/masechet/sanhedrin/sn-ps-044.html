<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ACHAN'S TRANSGRESSIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Zavda):</span> "Chota Yisrael" - even if a Yisrael sinned, he is still called a Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>People say 'a Hadas branch among Chilfa (an inferior type of Hadas) is still called Hadas.' (Ramah - Chilfa among Hadasim is called Hadas.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ila'i):</span> "V'Gam Ovru Es Brisi... v'Gam Lokchu Min ha'Cherem v'Am Gonvu v'Gam Kichashu v'Gam Simu vi'Chleihem" - it says 'Gam' five times to teach that Achan transgressed all five Chumashim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ila'i):</span> Achan pulled his foreskin to cover up his circumcision. It says here "v'Gam Avru Es Brisi", similar to "Es Brisi Hefar."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Ila'i already taught that he transgressed all the Torah. Circumcision is included!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he did not go so far (to annul a Mitzvah on his body).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Zavda):</span> "V'Chi Asa Nevalah b'Yisrael" teaches that he had Bi'ah with a Na'arah Me'orasah, about whom it says "Ki Osesa Nevalah b'Yisrael."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious (he transgressed the entire Torah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he did not go so far (a great sin to Hash-m, it also embarrasses her family and forbids her to her husband).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> The verse teaches that his punishment was to be stoned, like one who had Bi'ah with a Na'arah Me'orasah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Galusa):</span> It says "va'Yikach Yehoshua Es Achan... v'Es ha'Kesef... v'Es Banav v'Es Benosav v'Es Shoro... v'Es Kol Asher Lo" - he sinned, why were his children killed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rav Huna):</span> It says also "v'Chol Yisrael Imo." Were all of Yisrael killed?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions - Rav Huna):</span> His children and all of Yisrael were taken to see the execution, to instill in them fear of sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "V'Yisrefu Osam ba'Esh va'Yiskelu Osam" - were they burned and stoned?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> What was proper for burning (money and garments) was burned. What was proper for stoning (Achan and his animals) was stoned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "Va'Ere ba'Shalal Aderes Shin'ar Achas Tovah" - it was a cloak of clean white wool.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It was dyed with alum.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CRITICISM OF YEHOSHUA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> "Va'Yatzikum Lifnei Hash-m" - Yehoshua cast the spoils on the ground, and asked if these were worthy to cause the majority of the Sanhedrin to die in the battle against Ai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Va'Yaku...ki'Shloshim v'Shishah Ish" - they killed 36 people.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Nechemyah:</span> It says "<i>Ki</i>'Shloshim v'Shishah (like 36)." Really, they killed Ya'ir ben Menasheh, who is equal to the majority of a Sanhedrin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> "Tachanunim Yedaber Rash" refers to Moshe, who prayed in a soft voice for Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Ashir Ya'aneh Azos" refers to Yehoshua, who spoke brazenly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to say so about Yehoshua?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> "Va'Yatzikum Lifnei Hash-m" - Rav Nachman taught that he cast the spoils on the ground...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Also Pinchas did so!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Va'Ya'amod Pinchas va'Yfalel." It does not say 'va'Yispalel', rather, "va'Yfalel", he was judging in front of Hash-m;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>He cast Zimri and Kozbi on the ground, and asked if these were worthy to cause 24,000 Yisraelim to die in a plague.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He said "Lamah Ha'avarta Ha'avir Es ha'Am ha'Zeh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Moshe also said "Lamah Hare'osa la'Am ha'Zeh"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He said "v'Lo Ho'alnu va'Neshev b'Ever ha'Yarden."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shila):</span> "Va'Yomer Hash-m... Kum Lech" - your transgression is worse than theirs;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m commanded to set up the stones (immediately) "b'Avrechem Es ha'Yarden", but you waited until you entered 60 Mil into the land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "Ka'aser Tvivah Hash-m Es Moshe... Ken Tzivah Moshe Es Yehoshua... Lo Hesir Davar mi'Kol Asher Tzivah Hash-m" (Yehoshua did not transgress)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Hash-m say "Kum Lech"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yehoshua caused the problem (by forbidding the spoils of Yericho).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says about Ai "Ka'asher Asisa li'Richo...(but you will take the spoils and animals)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>When Yehoshua saw a Mal'ach in Yericho, he bowed to the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan taught that one may not greet someone with Shalom at night, for perhaps it is a Shed (all the more so, one should not bow down)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mal'ach had said "Ani Sar Tzeva Hash-m", so he knew that it was not a Shed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it lied!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shedim do not say Hash-m's name in vain.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">44b----------------------------------------44b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mal'ach rebuked Yehoshua for neglecting to offer yesterday's afternoon Tamid, and for not learning Torah now.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Yehoshua:</span> Which of these prompted you to come?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">The Mal'ach:</span> "Atah Vasi" (for your current neglect to learn).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Immediately, "va'Yalen Yehoshua... b'Soch ha'Emek" - he spent the night in the depth of Halachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel bar Unya):</span> Learning Torah is greater than bringing the Temidim. The Mal'ach came for neglect of the former.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MAL'ACHIM THAT BESEECH HASH-M</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> In Eretz Yisrael they expound "Al Tetzei la'Riv Maher..." - when Hash-m told Yechezkeil to tell Yisrael "Avich ha'Emori v'Imech Chitis", a Ru'ach Poskanis (a Mal'ach; Rashi - Gavri'el) asked, if Avraham and Sarah would come in front of You, would You embarrass them this way?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Rivcha Riv... v'Sod Achar Al Tegal" (rebuke Yisrael, but do not reveal the shame of Avraham and Sarah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does this Mal'ach have permission to speak this way to Hash-m?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Yes! He has three names: Piskin (he is Posek (speaks conclusively about Yisrael)), Itmon (he seals off the sins of Yisrael), and Sigron (if he must cease pleading for Yisrael, no other Mal'ach begins).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Ha'Ya'aroch Shu'acha Lo b'Tzar" - one should pray before he is afflicted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had Avraham not prayed for his descendants when he was between Beis Kel and Ai, they would have perished in the battle of Ai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "Ha'Ya'aroch Shu'acha Lo b'Tzar" - invigorating oneself in prayer blocks prosecution against himself above.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One should pray (to Hash-m) that the Mal'achim will help him, and not prosecute against him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CONFESSION BEFORE EXECUTION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> How do we know that this atoned for him?...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> How do we know that this atoned for him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yakorcha Hash-m ba'Yom ha'Zeh" - today you are sullied, but not in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "U'Vnei Zerach Zimri v'Eisan... Kulam Chamishah" - why must it say that there were five?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that all five have shares in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In Divrei ha'Yamim he is called Zimri, in Sefer Yehoshua he is called Achan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav or Shmuel):</span> His name is Achan. He is called Zimri because he did an action like Zimri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav and Shmuel):</span> His name is Zimri. He is called Achan because he caused the sins of Yisrael to be visited upon them like an Achna (snake).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he does not know how to confess... R. Yehudah says...(Chachamim say, if so, everyone will say this to) clear himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is wrong if he clears himself?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He will make people think that Beis Din killed an innocent person, and that the witnesses lied.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A case occurred in which a man said on his way to execution 'if I am guilty of this, my death should not atone for my sins. If I am innocent, my death should atone for my sins, Beis Din and Yisrael should be clear, the witnesses should never be forgiven.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When Chachamim heard, they said 'the sentence cannot be retracted. He will be killed. If the witnesses lied, they will bear their sin.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously, his words cannot overturn the sentence!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is, even if the witnesses retracted, we carry out the sentence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Once witnesses testify, they cannot retract!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is, even though they gave a reason (they lied due to hatred), they cannot retract (like the case in which Shimon ben Shetach's son was framed).</p>
