<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE DEATH OF REBBI ELIEZER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva citing R. Yehoshua):</span> Two people can gather gourds; only one is liable</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Akiva learned this from R. Eliezer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Eliezer fell sick. R. Akiva and his colleagues came to visit, they were in another room. It was Erev Shabbos; Hurkanos came to take off the Tefilin of his father R. Eliezer, who angrily sent him away.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Hurkanos (to Chachamim):</span> I think that my father (is about to die, and he) lost his sanity. (He does not agree to take off his Tefilin before Shabbos)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> No, my son and my wife lost their sanity. They are more worried about a mid'Rabanan law (wearing Tefilin on Shabbos) than things for which one is stoned (they should first finish cooking the food and light the Shabbos candles)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim saw that his mind was sound. They entered and sat four Amos away from him (because he had been excommunicated).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> Why did you come?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> To learn Torah from you!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> Why didn't you come before?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> We did not have time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> Surely, (you will be punished for not coming before, and) you will not die natural deaths!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> How will I die?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> Your death will be worse than theirs! I am like a closed Sefer Torah (that people did not open it to learn from it).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>I learned much from my Rebbeyim, but it was like a dog licking water from the ocean (compared to what they knew);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>I taught much, but it was like a stick inserted in a tube of eye-liner (it absorbs a tiny amount of what is there, i.e. of what I know).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>I know 300 laws of a bright Baheres (appearance of Tzara'as), no one ever asked me about them!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>I know 300 (Some say, 3000) laws of planting gourds (through Kishuf). R. Akiva is the only one who ever asked me about them!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span>Once we were walking together, he asked me to teach him about planting gourds. I said something, and the field became full of gourds. He asked me about uprooting gourds. I said something, and they all gathered to one place.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Question (Chachamim):</span> Do the following receive Tum'ah (all are covered with leather)?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A ball of wool, a mold (for making shoes), an amulet, a holder for a pearl, and a small weight.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Eliezer):</span> (I hold that) they can receive Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If they are torn (Chachamim agree that they can receive Tum'ah. I hold that) they may be immersed as they are (the inside is not a Chatzitzah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">Question (Chachamim):</span> Does a shoe that (was made and) is still on the mold receive Tum'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Eliezer):</span> It is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Eliezer's dying word was 'Tahor.' R. Yehoshua announced that the excommunication was lifted.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>They carried his coffin from Keisari to Lud. R. Akiva was wounding himself. His blood was spilling on the ground;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>He said "Avi Avi Rechev Yisrael" - I have many coins, and no moneychanger to look at them (i.e. no one else can answer my questions)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> R. Akiva learned the law of planting gourds from R. Eliezer. Why does he cite it in R. Yehoshua's name?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learned it from R. Eliezer, but he did not understand it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After he learned it from R. Yehoshua, he understood it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could R. Eliezer do acts of Kishuf?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he does an act of Kishuf, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This does not apply if it is done in order to learn or teach the laws of Kishuf.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Lo Silmad La'asos (do not learn in order to do Kishuf)", but you may learn in order to understand and give Halachic rulings.</p>

<p class="perekline">PEREK BEN SORER U'MOREH</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BEN SORER U'MOREH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A boy can become a Ben Sorer u'Moreh from the time he brings two hairs (after 13 years) until his beard fills out;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This refers to the lower (i.e. pubic) beard, and not the upper one. Chachamim use a clean expression.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We learn from "Ki Yihyeh l'Ish <i>Ben</i>" - a son, and not a daughter; a son, and not an adult.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A minor is exempt for he is not yet obligated to guard Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source that a minor is exempt?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> The Mishnah explicitly says that he is not yet obligated to guard Mitzvos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Why should we think that he is liable, and ask for a source to exempt him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Ben Sorer u'Moreh is not killed for his sin, rather, due to his future (if he would live, he would sin much more). Therefore, one might have thought that even a minor is killed;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Also, 'a son, and not an adult' connotes a minor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> "Ki Yihyeh <i>l'Ish Ben</i>" alludes to a son approaching the might of a man (the beginning of his adulthood).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ...Until his lower beard fills out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Chiya):</span> It is until the Ever is surrounded by hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> The Ever itself must be surrounded. The Beitzim need not be.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If a minor fathered a son, that son cannot become a Ben Sorer u'Moreh - "Ki Yihyeh <i>l'Ish</i> Ben", and not if a minor has a son.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need this to teach Rav Yehudah's law (above)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the Torah said 'Ki Yihyeh Ben l'Ish', we would only learn Rav Yehudah's law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it says "Ki Yihyeh l'Ish Ben" to teach Rav Chisda's law as well.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it comes to teach only Rav Chisda's law!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the Torah said 'Ben Ish', we would only learn Rav Chisda's law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it says "<i>l</i>'Ish Ben" to teach Rav Yehudah's law as well.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Rav Chisda argues with Rabah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> A minor cannot father children. We learn from "v'Im Ein la'Ish Go'el";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is there a Yisrael who does not have a Go'el (a relative who inherits him, who is commanded to redeem him if he becomes a slave)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse must refer to a convert. It teaches that one must investigate whether or not an Ish has a Go'el (perhaps he fathered children), but one need not investigate a minor (he cannot have children).</p>
