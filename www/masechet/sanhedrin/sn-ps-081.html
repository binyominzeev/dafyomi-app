<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO IS LIABLE TWO MISOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who is Chayav two different Misos receives the more stringent one;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one is liable two Misos for one transgression, he receives the more stringent one;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi says, he receives the one that arose first (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Surely, one who should receive a severe Misah should not benefit (get a lighter Misah) because he did another transgression!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The case is, he did a light transgression, he was sentenced for it, and then he did a severe transgression;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that once he was sentenced, he is already considered dead, and we do not judge him for the latter transgression. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef bar Chama's brother):</span> What is the source of this law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Noson):</span> "V'Holid Ben Paritz Shofech Dam... v'Es Eshes Re'ehu Timei v'El Gilulim Nasa Einav" - for murder he should be beheaded, for adultery he should be choked, for idolatry he should be stoned - "...Mos Yumas Damav Bo", he is stoned (the most severe one).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Perhaps all of these refer to Chayavei Skilah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Holid Ben Paritz Shofech Dam" refers to Ben Sorer u'Moreh, "v'Es Eshes Re'ehu Timei" refers to a Na'arah Me'orasah, and "v'El Gilulim..." is idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what does the verse teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Yechezkeil merely reviews laws of the Torah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, he should have reviewed like Moshe did (Rashi - the entire Torah; Ramah - explicitly, and not mere hints).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Chinena):</span> "El he'Harim Lo Achal" refers to one whose own merits sufficed, and he did not need his fathers' merits;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Einav Lo Nosa El Gilulei Beis Yisrael" - he did not walk with an upright posture;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"V'Es Eshes Re'ehu Lo Timei" - he did not infringe on another's profession;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"V'El Ishah Nidah Lo Kirev" - he did not receive from the Tzedakah box;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Raban Gamliel would cry when he reached the end of the verse "Tzadik Hu Chayo Yichyeh" - one who does all these will live, but not one who only does one of them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> If so, will you say that "Al Titam'u b'Chol Aleh" - do not do all of these abominations, but you may do one of them?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, you may not do any one of them. Likewise, one who has any one of the above merits will live.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>REBBI YOSI'S OPINION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one is liable two Misos for one transgression he (receives the more stringent one).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> He receives the one which arose first. If his mother-in-law became a married woman (and he had Bi'ah with her), he is judged for (Bi'ah with) a mother-in-law (stoning);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a married woman became his mother-in-law, he is judged for a married woman (choking).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> In the first case, why is he judged only for his mother-in-law? He should be judged for both!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> R. Yosi admits that one is judged for both Isurim if the latter is Mosif (if something was forbidden, and it now becomes forbidden to more people or in more situations). (Before his mother- in-law married, she was permitted to men (except her relatives); when she marries, she becomes forbidden to all men, her relatives are also liable (if they have Bi'ah with her) for a married woman.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It suffices to kill him once!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A PERSISTENT TRANSGRESSOR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If someone was lashed twice, Beis Din put him in Kipah (a cell) and feed him barley, until his stomach bursts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Just because he was lashed twice, we cause him to die?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> The Mishnah discusses someone lashed for Chayavei Kerisus. He is Chayav Misah (b'Yedei Shamayim (at the hands of Heaven));</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Because he shows that he is not concerned for his life, we bring his death closer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yakov):</span> The Mishnah discusses one who repeatedly transgressed the same Kares. i/f he transgressed two or three different Kerisus, he merely wants to experience them, this does not show an utter lack of concern for his life.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If someone was lashed twice...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We cause his death after only two transgressions. This is unlike R. Shimon ben Gamliel, who says that Chazakah is not established until three repetitions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Ravina):</span> The Mishnah can be like R. Shimon. Transgressions are Machazik (establish his nature) that he will persist sinning and should be killed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first two times he is lashed. The third time he is put in a cell.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1):</span> If Reuven transgressed a Lav for which one is lashed, the first two times he is lashed. The third time we put him in Kipah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Aba Sha'ul says, also the third time he is lashed. The fourth time we put him in Kipah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> All agree that Chazakah is established by lashes (Tosfos - continuing to sin after lashes; Rashi - lashes themselves);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim hold like Rebbi (two repetitions are Machazik), and Aba Sha'ul holds like R. Shimon ben Gamliel. (Tosfos - he is not Muchzak until the second or third transgression after lashes, i.e. the third or fourth transgression. Rashi - he is Muchzak after being lashed the second or third time, but we cannot give two punishments (lashes and Kipah) for one transgression, therefore Kipah is not until the third or fourth transgression)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Beraisa #2):</span> If Reuven was warned (not to transgress a Lav of lashes) and was silent or nodded his head (showing that he is Mezid, but he cannot be lashed, for he did not consent to be lashed for his sin):</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The first two times he is warned. The third time we put him in Kipah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Aba Sha'ul says, the first three times he is warned, and the fourth time we put him in Kipah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>This shows that he becomes Muchzak without lashes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> In both Beraisos, (both Tana'im agree that three repetitions are Machazik;) the argument is whether or not we must warn for Kipah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, since he becomes a Rasha when he transgresses the third warning, this suffices to put him in Kipah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Aba Sha'ul says, we cannot give Kipah until he transgresses a warning for Kipah, which we cannot give until he is a Rasha, i.e. he transgressed three warnings before this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Kipah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is a cell the size of his height.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where does the Torah allude to it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> "Temoses Rasha Ra" (one's wickedness will kill him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish) Question:</span> "Lo Yeda ha'Adam Es Ito ka'Dagim she'Ne'echazim bi'Mtzudah Ra'ah" - what is an evil trap?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a fish hook (it is small and weak. Fish do not realize that it will kill them.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A MURDERER WHO GETS <i>KIPAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one murdered without witnesses, we put him in Kipah and feed him meager amounts of bread and water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> How do we know that he murdered?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> There were two witnesses, but they did not see each other (therefore, we cannot give Misas Beis Din).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> There were two witnesses, but they did not warn him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Chisda):</span> The witnesses contradicted each other about Bedikos (details not essential to the testimony), but agreed about Chakiros (what is essential for the testimony);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A case occurred in which Ben Zakai asked the witnesses about the types of figs on a tree (a Bedikah. They disagreed, and Beis Din did not execute the Nidon. Rather, they put him in Kipah.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>PEOPLE KILLED WITHOUT <i>BEIS DIN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We feed him meager amounts of bread and water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does our Mishnah say that we feed him meager amounts of bread and water? The previous Mishnah said that we feed him barley until his stomach bursts?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> First we feed him meager amounts of bread and water to make his stomach shrivel up, then we feed him barley until his stomach bursts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A zealot may kill someone doing any of the following:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who steals ha'Kisvah (this will be explained), one who curses b'Kosem (in the name of idolatry), and one who has Bi'ah with a Nochris.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If a Kohen did Avodah when he was Tamei, the other Kohanim do not take him to Beis Din. Rather, the young Kohanim take him outside of the Azarah and break his head with pieces of wood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Akiva says, if a Zar (non-Kohen) did Avodah in the Mikdash, he is choked;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Chachamim say, Beis Din does not kill him. He is Chayav Misah b'Yedei Shamayim (at the hands of Heaven).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is Kisvah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is a Keli Shares - "v'Es Kesos ha'Nasech."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where does the Torah hint that one can be killed for stealing it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "k'Vala Es ha'Kodesh va'Mesu."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who curses b'Kosem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> He says 'Kosem should strike the One (Hash-m) who made it.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> He says 'it should strike Ploni (a person), and his Master (Hash-m), and the One who bestows to him.'</p>
