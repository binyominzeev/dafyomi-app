<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE GREATEST TZADIKIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Rabos Banos Asu Chayil" refers to Yosef and Bo'az;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'At Alis Al Kulanah" refers to Palti ben Layish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachman):</span> "Sheker ha'Chen" refers to Yosef. "V'Hevel ha'Yofi" refers to Bo'az. "Ishah Yir'as Hash-m Hi Sis'halal" refers to Palti ben Layish.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Alternatively, "Sheker ha'Chen" is the generation of Moshe. "V'Hevel ha'Yofi" is the generation of Yehoshua. "Ishah Yir'as Hash-m Hi Sis'halal" is the generation of Chizkiyah (which learned even more than those of Moshe and Yehoshua).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Alternatively, "Sheker ha'Chen" is the generation of Moshe and Yehoshua. "V'Hevel ha'Yofi" is the generation of Chizkiyah. "Ishah Yir'as Hash-m Hi Sis'halal" is the generation of R. Yehudah (which learned amidst awesome poverty).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Six of R. Yehudah's Talmidim would cover themselves in one garment, and learn.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN THE KING IS A MOURNER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a relative of the king dies, he does not leave his palace;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, he may follow the coffin if he wants, like David did when Avner died - "David Holech Acharei ha'Mitah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> No, that was an exception. He needed to show everyone that he was grieved (and had not told Yo'av to kill him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>When they give to him the meal of Havra'ah, they sit on the ground, and he sits on a Dargesh (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> In a place where the custom is that women follow the coffin, they must follow it. In a place where they go in front of the coffin, they must do so;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yehudah says, when Avner died, they went in front of the coffin (and we have no source for them to go in back) - "David Holech Acharei ha'Mitah" (surely, he would not walk among the women)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> He needed to show <i>all</i> that he was grieved. He walked among the men and among the women (perhaps the women were in back!) - "va'Yede'u Chol ha'Am... Lo Haysah meha'Melech Lehamis Es Avner."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava) Question:</span> "Va'Yavo Chol ha'Am Lehavros (to give the first meal to a mourner) Es David" - it is written 'Lehachros' (to cut)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> At first, they wanted to depose him. When they realized that he had not told Yo'av to kill Avner, they came to console him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Avner was punished because he did not protest against Sha'ul (Rashi - when Sha'ul ordered to kill the Kohanim of Nov; Maharsha - he did not convince Sha'ul of David's righteousness when David passed up the chance to kill Sha'ul).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> He protested, but it did not help!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They both expound "va'Ykonen ha'Melech... Yadecha Lo Asuros v'Raglecha Lo li'Nchushtayim Hugashu":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Yehudah explains, since you (Avner) were not in fetters, why didn't you protest?! Therefore, "ki'Nfol Lifnei Venei Avlah (you are like one who fell to the wicked)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yitzchak explains, David asked in astonishment 'why did you die like is proper for a Rasha?! You protested will all your strength. Why did you fall to Rasha'im?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yitzchak, why was Avner punished?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> He (made Ish Boshes king, which) delayed the kingship of David over Yisrael for two and a half years.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE BED THE KING SITS ON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When they give to him the meal of Havra'ah... (he sits on a Dargesh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a Dargesh?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula):</span> It is a bed that is not used. It is only for the sake of good Mazel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rabanan):</span> Until now, he never used this. Now that he is a mourner, he may sit on it?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> This is not difficult. Until now, he did not eat others' food, and now he does!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rava):</span> A Beraisa is difficult for Ula!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A mourner need not turn over a Dargesh, rather, he stands it up (on its side).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is a bed, it should be turned over!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A mourner turns over all the beds in the house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since people do not sit on it, it is like a bed for Kelim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He need not turn over a bed for Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #3 (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> It suffices (for a mourner) to unfasten the loops of a Dargesh, it falls by itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A bed for the sake of Mazel does not have loops!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravin):</span> A Dargesh is a leather sheet that attaches to a bedframe (through loops. One does not turn it over, lest the leather get ruined.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">20b----------------------------------------20b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> The loops of a Dargesh attach to holes in the bedframe itself. The ropes of a regular bed are attached on top of the frame.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> Wooden Kelim such as a bed or crib receive Tum'ah after the beams (of the frame) are smoothed with the skin of a fish.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If ropes of a regular bed are attached on top of the frame, there is no need to smooth them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rather, both kinds of beds attach to holes in the bedframe itself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In a regular bed, ropes are inserted into and come out of the frame (and are interwoven). In a Dargesh, loops attach to holes in the frame.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yakov):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yakov bar Ami):</span> A bed with a beam attached above (on which a canopy is spread) cannot be turned over, therefore, a mourner just stands it up (on its head or back board).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>LAWS OF A KING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A king consults with the Sanhedrin of 71 before going to an optional war;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He may breach fences to make a path for himself, and no one may protest. He may make a path as wide as he wants.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Everyone takes spoils in war. He takes half (and chooses which half).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Another Mishnah teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Seventy-one judges are needed to decide to go to an optional war.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since our Mishnah teaches other laws of kings, this was repeated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A king is permitted everything in the Parshah of the king.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> No, the Parshah was said only in order to make the people fear the king. "Som Tasim Alecha Melech" - his fear should be upon you.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>They argue like the following Tana'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> A king is permitted everything in the Parshah of the king.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, the Parshah was said only to make the people fear the king - "Som Tasim..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> Yisrael were commanded to fulfill three Mitzvos after entering Eretz Yisrael: to appoint a king, to exterminate Amalek, and to build the Beis ha'Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Nehurai says, there were not commanded to appoint a king. Rather, the Parshah describes the laws of kings in case they will request one - "v'Omarta Asimah Alai Melech."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> The elders of (Shmuel's) generation properly requested a king - "Tenah Lanu Melech Leshoftenu";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The ignoramuses requested improperly - "v'Hayinu... k'Chol ha'Goyim..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> Yisrael were commanded to fulfill three Mitzvos after entering Eretz Yisrael: to appoint a king, to exterminate Amalek, and to build the Beis ha'Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know which came first?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ki Yad Al Kes Kah Milchamah la'Shem ba'Amalek";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Kisei refers to (the throne of) a king - "va'Yeshev Shlomo Al Kisei Hash-m l'Melech" (and war with Amalek is mentioned after this).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which comes first, exterminating Amalek or building the Beis ha'Mikdash?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Heni'ach Lachem mi'Kol Oyveichem... ha'Makom Asher Yivchar Hash-m" (first, we must destroy Amalek).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We find similarly regarding David "... va'Shem Heni'ach Lo... (after subduing his enemies)... va'Yomer ha'Melech El Noson (he wanted to build the Beis ha'Mikdash)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> At first (before he married Nochriyos), Shlomo was king (even) over higher beings (Malachim and Ruchos) - "va'Yeshev Shlomo Al Kisei Hash-m";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Later, he was (only) king over people "Hu Rodeh Al Kol Ever ha'Nahar mi'Tifsach v'Ad Azah";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav or Shmuel):</span> Tifsach and Azah are at different ends of the world;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav and Shmuel):</span> Tifsach and Azah are next to each other. He ruled over the entire world as firmly as he ruled on the area between Tifsach and Azah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Later (because he did not repent), he was king only over Yisrael - "Ani Koheles Hayisi Melech Al Yisrael";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Later, he was king only over Yerushalayim - "Divrei Koheles Ben David Melech bi'Yrushalayim";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Later, he was only king over his bed - "Hinei Mitaso sheli'Shlomo"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>In the end (Ashmedai sent him away), he was only king over his staff - "v'Zeh Hayah Chelki mi'Kol Amali."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">(Rav or Shmuel):</span> This was his staff.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav and Shmuel):</span> This was his garment (some texts - his bowl or cup).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did he return to his kingship?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav and Shmuel argued about this. One said that he did, and the other said that he did not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The one who says that he did not return says that he was a king, and then a commoner;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The one who says that he returned says that he was a king, a commoner, and a king again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He may breach fences to make a path for himself. (...Everyone takes spoils in war. He chooses which half he wants to take.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Treasuries of (conquered) kings go to the king; he gets half of all other spoils.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Granted, it is the custom that treasuries of kings go to the king;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is the source that he gets half of all other spoils?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> "Va'Yimshechu la'Shem l'Nagid ul'Tzadok" equates the Nagid (leader) to Tzadok (the Kohen Gadol);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like Tzadok gets half (of the Lechem ha'Panim), also the Nagid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the Kohen Gadol gets half of the Lechem ha'Panim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Hayah l'Aharon ul'Vanav" - Aharon gets half, and the other Kohanim get half.</p>
