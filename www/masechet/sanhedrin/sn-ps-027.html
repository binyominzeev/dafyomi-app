<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FROM WHEN IS AN ED ZOMEM DISQUALIFIED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> A Zomem witness is disqualified retroactively (all testimony he gave or will give after his fabricated testimony is invalid);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> He is disqualified only from the time he was Huzam.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye says that he is disqualified retroactively. From when he testified, he is evil - "Al Tashes Yadcha Im Rasha Lihyos Ed Chamas";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Rava says he is disqualified from now and onwards, because the law of Edim Zomemim is a Chidush:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Why should we believe the latter witnesses (Mezimim), who say that the first pair are Zomemim? Perhaps the latter pair are lying!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The Torah's Chidush is that in this trial (and surely, for future testimonies) we say that the first pair are liars. We have no source to consider them liars before this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Rava agrees that the Torah disqualifies him retroactively;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim enacted that he is disqualified only from now and onwards to prevent a loss to buyers (who signed these witnesses on their documents or purchase). (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Practically, what is the difference between the two versions?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Each witness was Huzam by a different pair of witnesses. (It is no Chidush to believe the Mezimim. Only one witness contradicts each pair of Mezimim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The witnesses who testified were not Huzmu, rather other witnesses said that these witnesses stole (and are therefore invalid witnesses) before they testified.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to both answers, it is no Chidush to believe the latter witnesses. According to Version #1, the first witnesses are disqualified retroactively;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>According to Version #2, they are not disqualified retroactively, due to the loss to buyers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah mi'Difti):</span> Rav Papa ruled in a case like Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> The Halachah follows Abaye.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The Halachah follows Abaye against Rava in six places, whose acronym is <b>YA'AL K'GAM</b>. (The 'Ayin' refers to Zomemim witnesses.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IS A MUMAR DISQUALIFIED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>All agree that if a Mumar eats Neveilos for enjoyment, he is disqualified;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If he eats to anger (Hash-m) he is disqualified.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> He is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> He is disqualified, for he is a Rasha - "Al Tesht Rasha Ed."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> The Torah disqualified only Rasha'im of Chamas (they transgress for monetary gain).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rava - Beraisa):</span> "Al Tesht Rasha Ed" - do not accept a witness who transgresses Chamas, e.g. a thief or one who transgresses <i>oaths</i>.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He is disqualified for a false or vain oath, even non-monetary oaths!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it refers only to monetary oaths;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The plural (oaths) alludes to different kinds of monetary oaths. (Alternatively, <i>people</i> (plural) are disqualified due to false monetary oaths. One oath disqualifies a person.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Abaye - Beraisa):</span> "Al Tesht Rasha Ed" - do not accept a witness who transgresses Chamas, e.g. a thief or one who lends on Ribis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>This refutes Abaye.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue as Abaye and Rava argue.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> An Ed Zomem is disqualified for all testimonies.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, this is only if he was Huzam in a capital case. If he was Huzam in a monetary case, he is Kosher for capital cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Abaye holds like R. Meir, and Rava holds like R. Yosi:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Abaye holds like R. Meir. One who transgressed something light is suspected for more severe matters;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Rava holds like R. Yosi. He is not suspected for things more severe than what he transgressed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Granted, Abaye cannot hold like R. Yosi, but Rava could hold even like R. Meir;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir disqualified a monetary Ed Zomem from all testimony, for he is evil with respect to people and Hash-m;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Mumar to eat Neveilos (to anger Hash-m) is evil only towards Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT IS THE HALACHAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Halachah follows Abaye.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He was refuted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi taught the Beraisa that refuted him (and we know that R. Yosi holds like Rava).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even so, the Halachah follows R. Yosi when he argues with R. Meir!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is normally true, but here a Stam Mishnah is like R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Stam Mishnah is like R. Meir?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A case occurred in which Bar Chama killed someone. The Reish Galusa asked Rav Acha bar Yakov to investigate, and if he surely killed, to gouge out his eyes (some explain - give his money to the victim's heirs, or excommunicate him).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ploni and Almoni testified that he killed. Bar Chama brought two witnesses. One said 'I saw Ploni steal a Kav of peeled barley', the other said 'I saw him steal the handle of a spear.'</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">27b----------------------------------------27b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Acha bar Yakov:</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi against R. Meir. A thief is Kosher for capital cases!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Papi:</span> That applies in general, but here a Stam Mishnah is like R. Meir!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Stam Mishnah is like R. Meir?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> Anyone qualified to judge capital cases is qualified to judge monetary cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is unlike R. Yosim who says that a monetary Ed Zomem is disqualified for monetary cases but Kosher for capital cases. Rather, it is like R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the Mishnah discusses lineages disqualified from judging.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Support (Seifa):</span> One can be qualified for monetary cases, but disqualified for capital cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>We cannot say that he was Huzam in a capital case, for all agree that he is totally disqualified!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Rather, we must say that his lineage disqualified him from capital cases. Also the Reisha refers to lineages qualified to judge!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> The following are disqualified: diceplayers, those who lend on Ribis, Mafrichei Yonim, Socharei Shemitah, and slaves;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The general rule is, anything a woman cannot testify about, they cannot testify about. (This is a Mishnah in Rosh Hashanah. Our Mishnah (24b) omits slaves and this last clause.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot be R. Yosi. He says that a monetary Ed Zomem can testify in a capital case, even though a woman cannot!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Bar Chama kissed the feet of Rav Papi, and paid Rav Papi's head-tax for the rest of his life.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A RELATIVE CANNOT TESTIFY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> The following relatives are disqualified from testifying: a brother, a paternal or maternal uncle, a sister's husband, the husband of a paternal or maternal aunt, a step-father, a father-in- law, and a Gis (the husband of his wife's sister):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, their sons (i.e. of these relatives) and their Chasanim (son-in-laws) are disqualified;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A step-son is disqualified (but not his sons or sons-in-law).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The first version of the Mishnah disqualified only an uncle, cousin, anyone proper to inherit (i.e. paternal relatives), and anyone who was related at the time (that he saw testimony or comes to testify);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was related beforehand but was unrelated when he saw the testimony, he is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, if Reuven has children from Leah, he is considered a relative of her father even after she dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A close friend or enemy cannot testify.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A close friend refers to a Shushbin (one who brought gifts to a Chasan);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>An enemy is one who did not speak to him for three days due to hatred.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Yisraelim are not suspected to testify falsely due to love or hatred.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Question:</span> What do we learn from "Lo Yumesu Avos Al Banim"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It need not teach that fathers will not die for the sins of the sons or vice-versa. It already says "Ish b'Chet'o Yumasu"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it teaches that fathers will not die through testimony of their sons or vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really true that sons will not die for the sins of the fathers?! It says "Poked Avon Avos Al Banim"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is when they continue in the sins of the fathers.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"V'Af ba'Avonos Avosam Itam Yimaku" is when they continue in the sins of the fathers.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is even if they do not!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ish b'Chet'o Yumasu."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "V'Choshelu Ish b'Achiv" - a man will be punished for his brother's sin. This teaches that Yisraelim are responsible for each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is when he could have protested, and did not.</p>
