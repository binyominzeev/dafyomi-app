<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TWO THAT JUDGED A MONETARY CASE (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> All agree that if two judged a monetary case, this is not a judgment!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba - Mishnah):</span> If a judge judged and acquitted the guilty or obligated the innocent, or he declared Tamei what is Tahor or declared Tahor what is Tamei, what he did stands, and he must pay for the loss he caused.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the parties accepted him to judge alone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why must he pay?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They accepted him to give the law of the Torah, and he did not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Safra):</span> How did he err?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He erred in a clear-cut matter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Asi taught that if one erred in a clear-cut matter, we retract the judgment!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He erred in Shikul ha'Da'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Two Tana'im or Amora'im argue with each other. The Halachah was not decided like either, but the discussion on it (Gemara) favors one opinion, and the judge ruled like the other opinion.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>COMPROMISE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Shmuel and R. Avahu argue like the following Tana'im do.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Compromise requires three judges;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, one judge suffices.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We are thinking that both of these Tana'im equate compromise and judgment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Meir says that judgment requires three judges, and Chachamim say that two (Ran - or even one) suffice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all agree that judgment requires three judges;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir equates compromise and judgment, but Chachamim do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> There is a three-way argument among the Tana'im about compromise. R. Meir requires three judges, R. Shimon ben Gamliel requires two, and Chachamim require one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> No. R. Shimon ben Gamliel said two, but he holds that even one suffices;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He said two in order that there will be witnesses to the compromise.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Inference (Rav Ashi):</span> We learn from this that compromise does not need a Kinyan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it did, why would R. Meir require three, two would suffice, they will make a Kinyan, the parties agree to whatever the judges decide! (Rather, three judges are needed to empower the decision even though no Kinyan was made.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The Halachah is, compromise needs a Kinyan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Compromise requires three judges, just like judgment;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Once judgment was passed (Rashi; Tosfos - once the judges know the verdict), they may not suggest compromise.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Eliezer son of R. Yosi ha'Glili says, (if the parties came for judgment) one may not give a compromise; if one gives a compromise, he transgresses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one praises one who compromises, he angers Hash-m - "u'Votze'a Berech Ni'etz Hash-m";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, the law pierces the mountain (we follow it, no matter what it is).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This was Moshe's approach. Aharon loved Shalom, pursued Shalom, and made Shalom between people - "...b'Shalom uv'Mishor Halach Iti v'Rabim Heshiv me'Avon."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Eliezer says, if one stole wheat, made bread, separated Chalah and blessed, this only angers Hash-m - "u'Votze'a Berech Ni'etz Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Meir says "Botze'a" refers to Yehudah - "...Mah Betza Ki Naharog Es Achinu."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one praises what Yehudah said, he angers Hash-m - "u'Votze'a Berech Ni'etz Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Yehoshua ben Korchah says, it is a Mitzvah to compromise - "Emes u'Mishpat Shalom Shiftu b'Sha'areichem";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If there is Mishpat, there is not Shalom. If there is Shalom, there is not Mishpat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishpat that brings Shalom is compromise.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yhi David Oseh Mishpat u'Tzedakah" - Mishpat and Tzedakah do not go together!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishpat that has Tzedakah is compromise.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>The first Tana expounds the verse as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>David ha'Melech acquitted the innocent (Levi) and obligated the liable party (Reuven). David saw that Reuven was poor, so he paid on behalf of him - this is Mishpat and Tzedakah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is Mishpat for Levi. He receives what he deserves;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It is Tzedakah for Reuven. David paid for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rebbi):</span> Why does it say "Va'Yhi David Oseh Mishpat u'Tzedakah <i>l'Chol Amo</i>"? Tzedakah is only for the poor!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, even though David did not pay on behalf of Reuven, he did Mishpat and Tzedakah:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is Mishpat for Levi. He receives what he deserves;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It is Tzedakah for Reuven. David stopped Reuven from stealing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>R. Shimon ben Menasiya says, if two people come for judgment, until you sense what the verdict will be, you may suggest that they compromise;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Once you sense what the verdict will be, you may not suggest that they compromise. "Poter Mayim Reishis Madon v'Lifnei Hisgala ha'Riv Netosh" - before the (verdict) of the dispute is known, you may abandon the dispute (and pursue Shalom, i.e. compromise).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>R. Yehoshua ben Lakish says, if two people come for judgment, and one is tough and the other is not, you may withdraw from the case (lest you obligate the tough one and be in danger of reprisal) as long as you do not know which way the verdict leans;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Once you know which way the verdict leans, you may not withdraw - "Lo Saguru Mipnei Ish."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Korchah):</span> If a Talmid in front of his Rebbi sees that the poor person is innocent and the rich person is guilty, he may not be silent - "Lo Saguru Mipnei Ish", do not withhold your words due to a person's honor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanin):</span> The witnesses should know Whom they testify about (i.e. if they testify falsely, they force Hash-m to fix things), in front of Whom they testify, and Who will punish false witnesses - "v'Omedu... Lifnei Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The judges should know Whom they judge (i.e. wrong judgment will force Hash-m to fix things), in front of Whom they judge, and Who will punish improper judges - "Elokim Nitzav ba'Adas Kel", "Ki Lo l'Adam Tishpetu Ki la'Shem."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps a judge will say 'I should not judge, lest I err and be punished!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Imachem bi'Dvar Mishpat" - a judge judges according to what he sees. (If he does so, he will not be punished.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a final verdict?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is 'Ploni, you are liable. Almoni, you are Zakai (you receive, or are exempt).'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehoshua ben Korchah (who said that it is a Mitzvah to compromise).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Huna was Rav's Talmid, and he would offer the parties Din (law) or compromise!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehoshua ben Korchah means that it is a Mitzvah to <i>offer</i> (Din or) compromise.</p>
