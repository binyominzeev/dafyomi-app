<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TZEDAKAH OF HASH-M</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Chiya's sons Chizkiyah and Yehudah were at a meal in front of Rebbi. They were silent. Rebbi gave them wine to open them up.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>When they were drunk, they said '(Moshi'ach) ben David will not come until two great houses will cease, i.e. the Roshei Galusa in Bavel, and the Nesi'im in Eretz Yisrael - "v'Hayah l'Mikdash ul'Even Negef ul'Tzur Michshol li'Shnei Vatei Yisrael" (Moshi'ach will be the Mikdash of Yisrael, but he will end the greatness of two houses).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi (the Nasi):</span> You put thorns in my eyes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> Don't be angry at them. The Gematri'a of wine is 70, just like Sod (secret). When wine enters, secrets come out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda) Question:</span> "Va'Yishkod Hash-m Al ha'Ra'ah... Ki Tzadik Hash-m" - was Hash-m quick to bring evil on us because He is a Tzadik?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> Yes! It was Tzedakah to bring the exile of Tzidkiyahu (11 years after the exile of Yechanyah) while those exiled with Yechanyah (the Chachamim) were still alive. (We expound the verse that discusses these exiles.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Vehe'Charash" - they are called Cheresh, because when they discuss Torah, all are like Chershim (they have nothing to add);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Veha'Masger" - if they cannot resolve a Halachic matter, it is Sagur (no one opens it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Elef" - there were 1000 of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ula):</span> The Tzedakah was to bring the exile (after 850 years) two years before (852,) the Gematri'a of "v'Noshantem". (Had Yisrael been a full 852 years in Eretz Yisrael, the next verse "Avod Toveidun" would have applied.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> We learn from this that for Hash-m, 852 years is considered "Meherah" (quickly).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHY HASH-M MADE ONLY ONE MAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Therefore (Hash-m originally created only one man...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Hash-m originally created only one man, to prevent Minim from saying that there are different powers that created;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Alternatively, it was for the sake of Tzadikim and Resha'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Tzadikim should not think 'we descend from a Tzadik, so it is easy for us to be Tzadikim, and we need not distance ourselves far from sin.'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Resha'im should not think 'we descend from a Rasha, so repentance will not help us'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also, it was to prevent contention among families;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Even though we all descend from one man, families contend with each other. If we descended from two men, there would be even more contention!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Also, this dissuades theft and extortion:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Even though we all descend from one man, people steal. If we descended from two men, even more people would steal (they would say 'this belonged to my father')!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Also, this shows Hash-m's greatness...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This shows Hash-m's greatness. If a person makes a stamp to mint coins, they all look the same;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m made all people in the mold of Adam ha'Rishon, yet no two people look alike.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Tis'hapech k'Chomer Chosam" (after death, a man's stamp will become physical. It will be a garment for him after Techiyas ha'Mesim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't people look the same?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If everyone looked the same, one could see a nice house or woman and claim 'it is mine' (and no one could disprove him) - "v'Yimana me'Resha'im Oram."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> People are different from each other in three ways: voice, appearance and thinking.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They differ in voice and appearance, lest men have Bi'ah with others' wives;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They differ in thinking, due to thieves and extortionists (people think of different places to hide valuables).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Man was created on Erev Shabbos (at the end of creation) lest Minim be able to say that man was a partner in creation.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, if a man will get haughty, we will tell him that mosquitoes were created before him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also, it was so he should immediately guard the Mitzvah of Shabbos. (Ramah - he would have merited Torah and Mitzvos, including Shabbos, had he not sinned.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Also, it was so that he should find everything (already created and) ready for him to eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A parable explains this. A king built palaces and fixed them up. He prepared a banquet, then he brought the guests in - "Chachmos Bonsah Veisah...";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Chachmos Bonesah Veisah" - Hash-m created the world with Chachmah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>(The verse continues) "Chotzevah Amudeha Shiv'ah" - these are the seven days of creation;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>"Tovchah Tivchah Moschah Yeinah Af Orchah Shulchanah" are seas, rivers and all needs in this world.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>"Sholchah Na'aroseha Sikra" refers to Adam and Chavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> This verse continues "Al Gapei (a high place)", and later it says "Al Kisei"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Before he sinned, he was Al Gapei. After he sinned, he was Al Kisei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>"Mi Pesi... Chasar Lev Omerah Lo" - Hash-m said 'who enticed Adam?'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The woman did (she is called lacking understanding) - "No'ef Ishah Chasar Lev."</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> The dirt from which Adam was created was taken from all over the world - "Golmi Ra'u Einecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> (The dirt for) his body was taken from Bavel, his head was from Eretz Yisrael, and his limbs (Rashi - hands and feet) were from other lands;</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In the third hour, his limbs were formed;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> When Hash-m wanted to create man, He created a group of angels and asked if He should create man.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The angels asked how man would act. After Hash-m told them, they said "Mah Enosh Ki Sizkerenu"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Hash-m stuck His small finger among them. It burned them. He created a second group of angels, and the same happened with them.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>When the generations of the flood and the dispersion came, which transgressed greatly, the angels said 'the first groups were right!'</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After he sinned, Hash-m put His hand on him and diminished him - "...Va'Tashes Alai Kapecha."</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> The verse says that he stretched from one end of the world to the other. It also implies that he reached from the ground until Shamayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> These are the same size.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Adam spoke Arame'ic - "v'Li Mah Yakru Re'echa." (Ramah - Yakru (esteemed) is Arame'ic. Alternatively, Re'echa (your thoughts) is Arame'ic.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "Zeh Sefer Toledos Adam" teaches that Hash-m showed Adam every generation, its expounders, and its Chachamim.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Adam was a Min. "(Hash-m asked) Ayeka" - where is your heart leaning (i.e. to idolatry! R. Chananel - this and the next two Drashos are how Minim defend themselves, by <i>falsely</i> expounding that also Adam did as they do. Ramah - they are true Drashos of Chachamim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Adam did not circumcise himself (Ramah - even though he was commanded to.
