<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>LANGUAGES IN WHICH <i>SEFORIM</i>, <i>TEFILIN</i> AND <i>MEZUZOS</i> MAY BE WRITTEN (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> The Beraisa disqualifies other languages when the letters are not Ashuris.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> If so, why did the Beraisa mention Mikra that was written Targum, or vice versa? Even if Mikra was written Mikra and Targum was written Targum, it is not Metamei hands unless it is written Ashuris!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> The Beraisa is like R. Shimon ben Gamliel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, the Beraisa should permit also Yevanis!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses only Tefilin and Mezuzos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Tefilin and Mezuzos must be in Hebrew, because it says "V'Hayu" - (the words will be) as they are.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Beraisa mentioned Targum - where do we find this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is Targum in the Torah, i.e. "Yegar Sahadusa", but there is no Targum in Tefilin and Mezuzos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The Beraisa discusses Megilas Esther.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Megilah must be in Hebrew with Ashuris letters. We learn from "Ki'Chsavam vechi'Lshonam".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Targum is there in the Megilah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer  #1 (Rav Papa):</span> "<i>Pisgam</i> of the king was heard" is Targum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> "All women will give Yekar to their husbands" is Targum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ashi):</span> The Beraisa discusses other Seforim; it is like R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Tefilin and Mezuzos may only be written Ashuris; Raboseinu (R. Shimon ben Gamliel) permitted Yevanis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It says "v'Hayu" (they must be in Hebrew)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction (Beraisa):</span> Seforim may be written in any language; Raboseinu permitted Yevanis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that the first Tana forbids Yevanis (but in our Mishnah, Chachamim that argue with R. Shimon ben Gamliel permit all languages)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> The Beraisa should say 'Raboseinu permitted <i>only</i> Yevanis.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Raboseinu permitted Yevanis only regarding a Sefer Torah, because of the episode with King Tolmei.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE TRANSLATION OF THE SEVENTY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> King Tolmei gathered 72 Chachamim and put them in 72 houses, without telling them why. He then asked each to translate the Torah into Yevanis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Miraculously, every Chacham made the same (following) deviations from an accurate translation (lest the Yevanim find fault with the Torah or 'sources' for heresy).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Elokim created in the beginning (lest it sound like 'Bereishis' created Elokim)";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"<i>I</i> will make man in <i>an</i> image and <i>a</i> form";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"He finished on the <i>sixth</i> day, and rested on the seventh";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>"Male and female He created <i>him</i>";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>"<i>I</i> will descend and confuse their language";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>"Sarah laughed <i>amidst her relatives</i>"; (lest it seem that Sarah was criticized for the same reaction that Avraham had, and he was not criticized`).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>"In their anger they killed an ox and uprooted a <i>feeding trough</i>" (lest Shimon and Levi seem like murderers);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>"Moshe put his wife and children on the <i>people carrier</i>" (this suggests a horse or camel, which befits the dignity of our Rebbi more than a donkey);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>"Benei Yisrael were in Mitzrayim <i>and other lands</i> 400 years";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p>"He sent the <i>dignitaries</i> of Benei Yisrael" (it sounds undignified to say that youths were sent to welcome the Shechinah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p>"He did not stretch His hand to (strike) the <i>dignitaries</i> of Benei Yisrael" (to be consistent with the previous deviation);</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">9b----------------------------------------9b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p>"I did not take one <i>desired item</i> of theirs" (lest it sound like Moshe took things other than donkeys);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><p>"That Hash-m apportioned <i>to illuminate</i> to the nations" (lest they say that Hash-m authorized Nochrim to worship stars);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><p>"And he will serve other gods that I did not command <i>to serve them</i>" (lest it sound like they are autonomous);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">15.</span><p>"The small-footed animal" (Tolmei's wife was named Arneves. Had they not deviated, he would have thought that they were mocking him.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SEFORIM MAY BE WRITTEN IN YEVANIS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Gamliel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He learns from "Hash-m will be Yaft (beautify) Yefes and dwell in the tents of Shem" - the words (language) of Yefes (the father of Yavan) will be in the tents of Shem.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this refers to Gomer and Magog (other children of Yefes)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> "Yaft" refers to the most beautiful [language] of Yefes.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>HALACHOS OF KOHANIM GEDOLIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The only difference between a Kohen Gadol anointed with Shemen ha'Mishchah and Merubeh Begadim (one who is sanctified only by wearing the extra garments), is the Par (bull) brought to atone for a sin (if the Kohen Gadol transgressed Kares because he erred in Halachah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The only differences between a serving Kohen Gadol and Kohen she'Avar (he once substituted for the Kohen Gadol) are Par Yom Kipur and Asiris ha'Eifah (the Kohen Gadol's daily Minchah offering).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> A Merubeh Begadim is like an anointed Kohen regarding Par Yom Kipur and Asiris ha'Eifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Our Mishnah is unlike R. Meir:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A Merubeh Begadim brings a Par for a sin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say that he does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Meir's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> 'Mashi'ach' teaches that an anointed Kohen Gadol brings a Par (for a sin); "<i>ha</i>'Mashi'ach teaches that even a Merubeh Begadim brings a Par.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Meir!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> A Kohen she'Avar may serve.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If there was a need to substitute for the Kohen Gadol, the first Kohen Gadol resumes service when he is fit, and all Halachos of a Kohen Gadol apply to the substitute;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yosi says that the substitute cannot serve, not even like a regular Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>It once happened that R. Yosef ben Ulam of Tzipori substituted for a Kohen Gadol who became Tamei. Chachamim said that R. Yosef cannot serve as a Kohen Gadol lest this cause enmity; he cannot serve as a regular Kohen, since we ascend in Kedushah but we do not descend.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(Culmination of the question):</span> Is the Seifa R. Meir but the Reisha is not?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> Yes!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> The Mishnah is Rebbi. He holds like R. Meir regarding Kohen she'Avar, but not regarding Merubeh Begadim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ALTARS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The only difference between a large (public) Bamah and a small (private) one is Korban Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The rule is, one may offer on a (small) Bamah only Nedarim and Nedavos (Korbanos brought for vows or voluntarily).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Korban Pesach is not the only difference! (The Tamid was brought on a public Bamah; the Seifa shows that it may not be brought on a private Bamah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that the only differences are (obligatory Korbanos with a fixed time,) like Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Our Mishnah is R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Even the Tzibur offered only Pesach and obligatory Korbanos with a fixed time. Chiyuvim without a fixed time (e.g. Par Helam Davar) may not be brought on either kind of Bamah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The only difference between (the Mikdashos in) Shilo and Yerushalayim is that Kodshim Kalim and Ma'aser Sheni could be eaten anywhere from which Shilo was visible, whereas the Heter of Yerushalayim was only within the wall.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>In both places, Kodshei Kodoshim were eaten within the curtains. (In Shilo there were curtains around Chatzer ha'Mishkan. In Yerushalayim there were curtains around the Azarah while they were building the walls; after they were built, Kodshei Kodoshim were eaten within the walls.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>After (Churban) Shilo, Bamos were permitted. They were not permitted after (Churban) Yerushalayim.</p></div>
