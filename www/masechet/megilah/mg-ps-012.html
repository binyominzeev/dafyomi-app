<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MISCALCULATIONS OF THE SEVENTY YEARS OF EXILE (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Also Daniel miscalculated! "Ani Daniel <i>Binosi</i> bi'Sforim" connotes that he had erred.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> The 70 years are "Melos l'Bavel"; it also says "l'Charvos Yerushalayim Shiv'im"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The first verse (counts from the conquest of Yehoyakim and) alludes to a sanction to begin rebuilding the Mikdash (from Koresh; he later retracted. They started again 70 years from the Churban, and this was completed);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn (the former) from "Koresh, king of Persia, said '... Hash-m appointed me to build for Him a house in Yerushalayim.'"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman bar Rav Chisda):</span> "So said Hash-m to his Mashi'ach, to Koresh" -   Koresh was not Mashi'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Hash-m was complaining about Koresh to Mashi'ach. I said that <i>he</i> should build My house and gather My exiles, but he said 'who will go up among you, will go' (he did not go himself).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ACHASHVEROSH'S PARTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Cheil Paras u'Madai", but another verse puts Madai first, "L'Malchei Madai u'Faras"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> They agreed that if the kings will be from Paras, the officers will be from Madai, and vice versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> "In showing the wealth, the honor of his kingdom" teaches that he wore Bigdei Kehunah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says here "Tif'eres", like it says regarding Bigdei Kehunah, for honor and glory.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav and Shmuel argue about "When these days finished":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One says that he was a clever king. First he endeared subjects from far away, for he can always appease those close by;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The other says that he was foolish. First he should have endeared subjects of his region, so they would support him if the others rebel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Talmidei R. Shimon):</span> Why were <i>the haters of</i> (this is a euphemism) Yisrael of that generation worthy to be destroyed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon bar Yochai:</span> Answer yourselves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Talmidim):</span> It was because they benefited from the Rasha's (Achashverosh's) meal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Shimon):</span> If so, the decree should have been against only the Yisraelim in Shushan, not in the whole world!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Talmidim:</span> How do you answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Shimon bar Yochai):</span> It was because they bowed to Nevuchadnetzar's image. (Tosfos (Avodah Zarah 3a DH she'Lo) says that it was not Avodah Zarah. Nevertheless, they should not have bowed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Talmidim):</span> (If so, how did they merit to be saved miraculously?) Did Hash-m show partiality?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon):</span> They did not really serve it, they just appeared to do so. Similarly, Hash-m only appeared to decree their destruction - "Ki Lo Anah mi'Libi."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rav and Shmuel argue about "In the courtyard, the garden, the orchard of the king":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One says that everyone was placed in one of these places, according to his prestige;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The other says that Achashverosh put everyone in the courtyard, but they did not fit. He put them all in the garden, but they did not fit. Finally, he put them in the orchard, and they fit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He put them in the courtyard and made two openings; one was to the garden, and one was to the orchard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "<i>Chur</i>, Karpas u'Techeiles" - it was Chari Chari (needlepoint, full of holes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> He spread white (Chiver) silk for them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> Karpas is Karim of Pasim (striped pillows).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Beds of gold and silver" - everyone was seated on a bed of gold or silver, according to his prestige.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Nechemyah):</span> That would cause jealousy! Rather, the beds were of silver and the legs were of gold.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ACHASHVEROSH'S PARTY (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> "Bahat" are stones for which people MisCHoTet (obtain after great exertion and expense);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like "Avnei MisNoSesos", which come through great Nisyonos (difficulties).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "Dar v'Sochares" - Dari Dari (there were rows and rows of the stones Sechor (around)).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> There is a precious stone in the port cities, called Darah; he set it in the middle of the meal, and it illuminated for them like noon (Sihara).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> He proclaimed Deror (freedom from taxes) for all Sochrim (merchants).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "Mi'Kelim <i>Shonim</i>"? It should say 'Meshunim'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> A voice from Heaven said 'the Rishonim (Belshatzar and his company) were destroyed because of Kelim, and you are Shonim (repeating their mistake)!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "V'Yein Malchus <i>Rav</i>" - each person was given wine Rav (older) than himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "The drinking was <i>k'Das</i>"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chanan):</span> It was like the Torah says, i.e. the eating exceeded the drinking (just like an animal and the flour offered with it exceed the wine offered with it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Without compulsion" - everyone was given wine of his country (he is used to it, he can control how drunk he gets).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Ki'Rtzon Ish va'Ish " - the desire of Mordechai and Haman (they served the wine).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Mordechai is called "Ish Yehudi"; Haman is called "Ish Tzar v'Oyev".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Also Vashti made a party for the women in the palace" - it should have been in the women's house!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Both of them (she and Achashverosh) intended for sin (that people should see her beauty).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like people say, he is in big gourds, and his wife in small gourds.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE KILLING OF VASHTI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "On the seventh day, when the king's heart was merry with wine" - was it not merry with wine until now?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The seventh day was Shabbos, when Yisrael eat and drink and begin with Divrei Torah and praises, whereas idolaters eat and drink and begin with obscenities.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Likewise, at the Rasha's party some said that Persian women are beautiful, and others said that Median women are beautiful.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Achashverosh:</span> My Keli (wife) is neither, rather, Babylonian. Would you like to see her?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The others:</span> Yes, but she must be naked.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Hash-m treats people Midah k'Neged Midah. We learn from here that Vashti the Resha'ah used to strip Jewish women of their clothing and make them work on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"... Achashverosh remembered what she did and what was decreed upon her" - just like she did was decreed upon her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learned that Vashti intended for sin; why didn't she come?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> This teaches that she became leprous.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> Gavri'el came and made a tail on her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "The king was very angry" - why was he so angry?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> She sent to him 'Stable boy of my father! My father would drink as much as [the bigger drinker among] 1000 people and not get drunk, but wine gets you drunk!' (Chasam Sofer - she said this in Babylonian, the servants who relayed the message did not understand it. This was why Achashverosh decreed that a woman must speak the language of her husband.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>"The king said to the Chachamim" refers to Rabanan; "who know the times" - they know how to make leap years and to fix Rosh Chodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Achashverosh asked Rabanan to judge her. They reasoned:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we tell him to kill her, tomorrow he will sober up and blame us for convicting her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We cannot tell him to pardon her, for she disgraced the king!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> After the Churban we were exiled from our land, and we lost the counsel needed for capital cases. Go ask (Amon and - Tosfos deletes this from the text) Mo'av, who sit on their land like wine sitting on its dregs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Mo'av has been tranquil from his youth... he did not go into exile, therefore he still has his reason... "</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>EXPOUNDING NAMES IN THE <i>MEGILAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> "Veha'<i>Karov</i> Elav Karshena Shesar..." - this entire verse alludes to Korbanos (the angels mentioned Yisrael's merits so that Hash-m would avenge Vashti and make Esther queen):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Karshena" - did they (Nochrim) offer in front of you KaRim Benei SHaNah (yearling lambs), like Yisrael?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Shesar" - did they offer to You "SHtei ToRim (two birds)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Admasa" - did they build for You an altar of Adamah (earth)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"Tarshish" - did they serve in front of You with Bigdei Kehunah, which contain "Tarshish v'Shoham v'Yashfe (gems on the Choshen)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>"Meres" - did they Memares (mix) blood (to prevent it from hardening) in front of You?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>"Marsena" - did they Memares (knead) Menachos in front of You?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>"Memuchan" - did they Mechin (prepare) a Shulchan in front of You?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Memuchan" is Haman. He is called Memuchan because he was Muchan (prepared) for punishment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> (Memuchan was the last and lowest of the advisors, yet he spoke first;) this shows that the commoner jumps to the top.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "That each man should rule in his house" - if not for the first letters (which established the king to be a fool), there would not have remained any remnant of (the haters of) Yisrael (people would have rushed to carry out Haman's letters immediately, before the designated day).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>People said that the first letters are unnecessary, for even a bald man is the officer in his house! (Maharsha - Rashi merely says that also a weaver (a lowly profession) rules in his house. Rashi agree that 'Karachah' is a bald man.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "Every sharp one acts wisely" refers to David. He sought "<i>a</i> virgin" (only one; therefore everyone eagerly brought his daughter, hoping that she will be picked);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"A fool spreads folly" refers to Achashverosh. "The king appointed overseers" (he will gather many girls and have relations with all of them, but only one will become queen), so people hid their daughters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Ish Yehudi Hayah ... Ish Yemini" - if the verse comes to give his lineage, it should trace the entire lineage until Binyamin! Why does it only list three?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> It lists only ancestors whose names apply to Mordechai:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Ben Ya'ir" - he (Mordechai) was Me'ir (illuminated) the eyes of Yisrael with his prayer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Ben Shim'i" - Hash-m Shama (heard) his prayer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Ben Kish" - he was Mekish (knocked) on the gates of mercy, and they opened for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> He is called "Yehudi", i.e. from Yehudah; he is also called Yemini, i.e. from Binyamin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> Mordechai was crowned with impeccable Torah conduct (Aruch. Maharsha - the verse gives the lineage of both of his parents, like Rabah bar Rav Huna explains immediately. According to this, Rabah bar Rav Huna is not a separate answer).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> His father was from Binyamin and his mother was from Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rabanan):</span> The Shevatim competed over taking credit for his birth:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yehudah took credit, for David (from Yehudah) did not kill Shim'i ben Gera (even though Shim'i was Chayav Misah for cursing David; this enabled Mordechai to descend from Shim'i;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Binyamin took credit, since Mordechai descends from Binyamin.</p>
