<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SPECIAL SEASONAL TORAH READINGS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>We do not interrupt during the Klalos. Rather, one person reads them all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>On Monday, Thursday and Shabbos afternoon we read from the (coming) weekly Parshah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This does not count towards reading the Parshah. We read the entire Parshah the coming Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>"Va'Ydaber Moshe Es Mo'adei Hash-m El Benei Yisrael" - they should read about each Mo'ed in its time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> The Torah readings and Haftoros for the Mo'adim are as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On the first day of Pesach we read Parshas Mo'adim, and (the Haftorah is) the Korban Pesach brought in Gilgal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Haftorah for the second day (Yom Tov of Chutz la'Aretz) is the Korban Pesach in the days of Yoshiyahu.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>On the other days we read from various Parshiyos relating to Pesach.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The acronym for them is <b>MAFU</b> (Mishchu, Im Kesef, Pesal Lecha, va'Yedaber).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>On the seventh day we read "Va'Yehi b'Shalach", and "Va'Yedaber David" (for the Haftorah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>On the eighth day (in Chutz la'Aretz) we read "Kol ha'Bechor", and "Od ha'Yom."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Today the custom is to read on the eight days "Meshech", "Tura", "Kadesh", "b'Kaspa", "Pesal", "b'Madbera", "Shelach", "Buchra".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>On Shavu'os we read "Sheva Shavu'os" and the Haftorah is in Chabakuk;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>Others say, we read "In the third month", and the Merkavah (in Yechezkeil);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Nowadays (that we have two days of Yom Tov) we read like both of them. On the first day we read like Others, and on the second like the first Tana.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>On Rosh Hashanah we read "Ba'Chodesh ha'Shevi'i", and "Ha'Ben Yakir Li" (for the Haftorah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>Others say, we read "Va'Shem Pokad Es Sarah" and about Chanah (Hash-m gave pregnancy to both of them on Rosh Hashanah).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Nowadays we read like Others on the first day. On the second day we read the Akeidah and "Ha'Ben Yakir Li."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>On Yom Kipur we read "Acharei Mos" and "Ki Ko Omar Ram v'Nisa". At Minchah we read the Parshas Arayos, and the Haftorah is Sefer Yonah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Wherever Hash-m's greatness is mentioned, His humility is mentioned right after this. We find this in Torah, Nevi'im, and Kesuvim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>In Torah it says "Hash-m... Elokei ha'Elokim... Ose Mishpat Yasom v'Almanah". In Nevi'im it says "Cho Omar Ram v'Nisa... v'Es Daka u'Shfal Ru'ach". In Kesuvim it says "Solu la'Rochev ba'Aravos ... Avi Yesomim v'Dayan Almanos".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>On the first day of Sukos we read Parshas Mo'adim in Vayikra, and "Hinei Yom Ba la'Shem" for the Haftorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>On the second day we read the same Torah reading, and "Melech Shlomo gathered".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The rest of Sukos we read the Korbanos of each day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>On Shmini Atzeres we read the Mitzvos and Chukim that apply at this time, and "Kol ha'Bechor". The Haftorah is "When Shlomo finished... "</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>On Simchas Torah we read "V'Zos ha'Berachah", and "And Shlomo stood... "</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The Shabbos of Chol ha'Moed (of both Pesach and Sukos) we read "Re'e Atah... " On Pesach the Haftorah is "These dry bones". On Sukos it is "Ba'Yom Ba Gog".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>On Chanukah we read (Chanukas ha'Mishkan of) the Nesi'im, and (on Shabbos) the Neros in Zecharyah for the Haftorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there is a second Shabbos, its Haftorah is the Neros of Shlomo.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>On Purim we read "Va'Yavo Amalek".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>On Rosh Chodesh we read "uv'Roshei Chodsheichem". When Rosh Chodesh is on Shabbos, the Haftorah is "V'Hayah Midei Chodesh b'Chodsho".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When Rosh Chodesh begins on Motza'ei Shabbos, the Haftorah of Shabbos is "Machar Chodesh".</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">31b----------------------------------------31b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> When Rosh Chodesh Av falls on Shabbos, the Haftorah is "Chodsheichem u'Mo'adeichem San'ah Nafshi...."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Hayu Alai l'Torach" - they force Hash-m to devise an appropriate punishment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> On Tish'ah b'Av, the Haftorah is "Eichah Haysah l'Zonah".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Others):</span> The Torah reading is "V'Im Lo Tishme'u Li";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>R. Nosan bar Yosef says, it is "Ad Anah Yena'atzuni ha'Am ha'Zeh";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>Some say it is "Ad Anah la'Edah ha'Ra'ah ha'Zos".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The custom is to read "Ki Solid Banim", and "Asof Asifem" for the Haftorah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MA'AMADOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On Ma'amados we read Ma'ase Bereishis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami):</span> Heaven and earth would not endure without (the Torah of Yisrael, who would not endure without) the merit of Ma'amados. It says "Im Lo Brisi Yomam va'Laylah Chukos Shamayim va'Aretz Lo Samti", and it says "Ba'Meh Eda";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Avraham asked Hash-m:</span> If Benei Yisrael will sin, will they be destroyed like Dor ha'Mabul or scattered like Dor ha'Flagah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> No.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Avraham:</span> "Ba'Meh Eda (how can I teach them to get Kaparah for their sins)?"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> "Kache Li Eglah... (Korbanos can atone for them)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Avraham:</span> What will happen when there is no Beis ha'Mikdash?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> When they read the Parshiyos of Korbanos, I consider it as if they offered them, and I will pardon all their sins.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BERACHOS AND KLALOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On Ta'aneisim we read Berachos and Klalos. We do not end an Aliyah in the middle of the Klalos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chiya bar Gamda):</span> "My son, do not despise the rebuke of Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> We do not bless on punishments. (Even though in the days of the Mishnah only the first and last Olim blessed, in the Yerushalmi Reish Lakish says that there are certain Parshiyos over which we bless before and after. Berachos and Klalos are among them - Tosfos R. Akiva Eiger.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The one who reads the Klalos starts a verse before them, and reads a verse after them. (It seems that this is like the Tana (22a) who permits reading one verse from a Parshah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This applies to the Klalos in Vayikra, but not to those in Devarim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Klalos in Vayikra were said in the plural ("Im Lo Tishme'u... "), and Hash-m said them through Moshe. Those in Devarim were said in the singular, and Moshe said them (with Ru'ach ha'Kodesh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Levi bar Buti was hurriedly muttering the Klalos in Devarim (he was distressed to say them). Rav Huna told him that one may stop in the middle of the Klalos in Devarim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa -R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> Ezra enacted that we should read the Klalos in Vayikra before Shavu'os, and those in Devarim before Rosh Hashanah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This is so we should finish the year and its Klalos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This does not explain those in Vayikra!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It does!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The world is judged on Shavu'os regarding fruits (it is also like a new year).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> If elders tell you to destroy, and youths tell you to build, listen to the elders - their destruction is building, and the building of youths is destruction, like we find regarding Rechavam. (Elders told him to be gentle for one day, to solidify his kingship. Youths told him to be harsh to solidify his reign, and this caused him to lose most of the kingdom - Melachim 1:12.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE READING OF MONDAY, THURSDAY AND SHABBOS AFTERNOON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Each time we read the Torah (Shabbos morning, Shabbos afternoon, Monday, and Thursday) we begin reading where we stopped the previous time;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, on Shabbos afternoon, Monday, Thursday and the coming Shabbos morning we begin where we stopped last Shabbos morning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> The Halachah is, on Shabbos afternoon, Monday, Thursday and the coming Shabbos morning we begin where we stopped last Shabbos morning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he simply say that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He had to say the law explicitly, because some switch the opinions of R. Meir and R. Yehudah (from our text of the Beraisa).</p>
