<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> Prophets taught the five final-letters of the Aleph-Beis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> "Eleh ha'Mitzvos" - a Navi may not change a law through prophecy (changing the letters affects Tefilin and Mezuzos)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rav Chisda):</span> The Samech and final Mem stood miraculously in the Luchos (this shows that the final letters were given to Moshe)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All the letters were already known, just it was not known which are the final letters and which come in the beginning or middle of words.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, this is something new, a prophet may not teach it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Nevi'im merely restored something that had been known and was forgotten.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE ARAMEIC TRANSLATION OF THE TORAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> Onkelus revealed the translation of the Torah, which he received from R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Yonasan ben Uzi'el revealed the translation of Nevi'im, which he received from Chagai, Zecharyah and Malachi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Eretz Yisrael shook 400 Parsa'os, and a voice from Heaven protested that secrets are being revealed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Yonasan replied that his only intention was to prevent disputes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Yonasan wanted to reveal the translation of Kesuvim. A Heavenly voice told him that he had already revealed enough.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was he allowed to reveal the translation of Nevi'im, but not of Kesuvim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The translation of Kesuvim contains the time when Mashi'ach will come.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Onkelus did not reveal the translation of Torah. It was already known in the days of Ezra, long before Onkelus!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ika bar Avin):</span> "Va'Yikre'u va'Sefer b'Soras ha'Elokim" refers to the (Hebrew) text itself; Mefurash refers to the translation; "v'Shum Sechel" refers to the breaks between verses; "va'Yavinu ba'Mikra" refers to the cantillation (which shows how the words should be grouped).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The translation was forgotten, and Onkelus re-established it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Eretz Yisrael shake when the translation of the Nevi'im was revealed, but not when the translation of Torah was revealed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah is generally revealed, but many things in the Nevi'im are hidden, and are known only through the translation, e.g. "like the eulogy of Hadadrimon in the valley of Megidon";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Without the translation, I would not understand this (we do not find that he was eulogized there)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The translation reveals that these are the eulogies of Achav (who was killed by Hadadrimon) and Yoshiyahu (who was killed in the valley of Megidon).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "I, Daniel, saw the vision; the people with me did not, but they were frightened and hid" - who were the people with Daniel?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> They were Chagai, Zecharyah and Malachi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>In one respect, they are better than he is - they are Nevi'im, and Daniel is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>In one respect, he is better than they are - he saw, and they did not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they did not see, why were they frightened?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Their Mazalos (the angels appointed over them) saw.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> This teaches that if one is frightened and does not know why, it is because his Mazel saw something.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What should he do?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He should recite Shema. If he may not because the area is unclean, he should move four Amos away (perhaps the danger is only right here). If not, he should say 'The goat at the butchery is fatter than I am' (suggesting to the Mazikim to harm something else).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WE ABANDON OTHER MITZVOS TO HEAR THE MEGILAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we expound "Medinah u'Mdinah" and "v'Ir va'Ir", we should also expound "Mishpachah u' Mishpachah"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> This teaches that Kohanim and Leviyim abandon Temple Service to go to hear the Megilah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Kohanim, Leviyim and Yisraelim abandon their Avodah, singing and Ma'amados (overseeing the Avodah) to hear the Megilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Kohanim, Leviyim and Yisraelim abandon their Avodah, singing and Ma'amados to hear the Megilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>In Rebbi's house they abandoned learning Torah to hear the Megilah - they learned from here:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We abandon Avodah to hear the Megilah - all the more so we abandon Torah to hear the Megilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Kal va'Chomer assumes that Temple Service is greater than learning Torah - but this is not so!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Yehoshua saw (what looked like) a man and bowed to him"- how could he do so?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> One may not greet a friend with 'Shalom' at night, perhaps it is a Shed! (We do not put Shalom, a name of Hash-m, on a Shed; all the more so one may not bow to it, for this is like idolatry!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The man had said "I am an officer in the legion of Hash-m", so Yehoshua knew that he was not a Shed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he lied!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We have a tradition that Shedim do not say Hash-m's name l'Vatalah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>The angel rebuked Yehoshua for having omitted offering the afternoon Tamid, and for not learning at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Yehoshua:</span> Which was the main reason you came?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">The angel:</span> "I came (because of Bitul Torah) now".</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Yehoshua spent the night in the valley" - he lodged in the depth of Halachah.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">3b----------------------------------------3b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Uniya):</span> The fact that the angel came for Bitul Torah shows that Torah is greater than Avodah! (This sums up the question.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Torah of the Rabim is greater than Avodah, but an individual's Torah is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah of an individual is also great!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On Chol ha'Mo'ed, women may eulogize together, but do not beat themselves over a death;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yishmael says, those close to the coffin are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>On Rosh Chodesh, Chanukah and Purim, they may eulogize together and beat themselves;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>At all of these times they may not answer to one eulogizer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Huna):</span> These restrictions of the Mo'ed do not apply to [eulogizing] a Chacham, and all the more so Chanukah and Purim [do not]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The honor of an individual that learns is great (R. Chananel - more than Keri'as ha'Megilah and Avodah), but his learning is not as great.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> I know that Keri'as ha'Megilah has precedence over Avodahfrom R. Yosi b'Ribi Chanina (b);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>I know that Keri'as ha'Megilah has precedence over learning Torah from Rebbi's house (b:3);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>I know that a Mes Mitzvah (burying an unattended corpse) has precedence over learning Torah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We abandon Torah for burial and to bring a bride to the Chupah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>I know that a Mes Mitzvah takes precedence over Avodah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> If one was heading to offer Korban Pesach or to circumcise his son, and he heard that a relative died, perhaps he interrupts to bury the Mes (even though he will lose the first Mitzvah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Lo Yitama" (just like a Nazir does not become Tamei for a relative, also someone doing a Mitzvah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps just like he does not interrupt for his sister, he does not interrupt for a Mes Mitzvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ul'Achoso" - he does not interrupt for his sister; but he interrupts for a Mes Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Which has precedence - Keri'as ha'Megilah, or a Mes Mitzvah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps Keri'as ha'Megilah comes first, because it publicizes the miracle.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Perhaps a Mes Mitzvah comes first, because it honors Hash-m's creations.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> A Mes Mitzvah has precedence:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It was taught that honoring people is such a great Mitzvah that it overrides a Lav of the Torah (one may ignore a lost object if it would be beneath his dignity to carry such an item in public).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHAT IS CONSIDERED A WALLED CITY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Levi:</span> A walled city and every place close to it and every place seen with it are treated as a walled city.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It suffices to be close or visible.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand how a place can be visible but not close, e.g. the top of a mountain;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But how can it be close but not seen? (Seemingly, this is not difficult at all! Eliyahu Rabah (688:4) answers that here, "close" means within the Ibur of the city, about 71 Amos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> It is in a valley.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Levi:</span> A walled city which was inhabited and then enclosed by a wall is <i>not</i> considered a walled city (regarding Megilah (Tosfos) or the right to redeem a house sold in a walled city (Rashi)).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "If a man will sell Bayis <i>Moshav Ir Chomah</i>" - the Yishuv (settlement of the city) occurred when it already had a wall.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Levi:</span> A large city without 10 Batlanim (people without a job who spend all day in the Beis ha'Keneses) is considered a village. (Tosfos - this does not apply to walled cities; the Ran gives other Pirushim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already know this from a Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A large city is one with 10 Batlanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that if outsiders come and are found in the Beis ha'Keneses, it is considered a village; a city must have 10 <i>residents</i> that are Batlanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Levi:</span> If a walled city became desolate and was later inhabited, it is considered a walled city.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'became desolate'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Its walls fell; if they were not rebuilt, it is not considered a walled city.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Eliezer bar Yosi):</span> "Asher <i>Lo</i> Chomah" - we can read Lo (to it) like Lamed Aleph (not), i.e. '[even if] it does <i>not</i> have a wall (now, but it used to have  one)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that it became desolate of 10 Batlanim.</p></div>
