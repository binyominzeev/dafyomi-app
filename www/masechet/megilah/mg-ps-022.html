<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE <i>KRI'AH</i> ON ROSH CHODESH (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> I did not hear this, but I heard the answer to a similar question (from which we can answer your question):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On Sunday, Ma'amados read Parshiyos Bereishis and Yehi Raki'a.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Bereishis is split among two Olim. One Oleh reads Yehi Raki'a.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Bereishis has five verses. How do we divide it?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One does not read less than three verses.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> The second person repeats a verse read by the first.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> Each reads two and a half verses.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Rav didn't say like Shmuel, for he holds that we do not split verses of the Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Shmuel permit to split verses of the Torah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Chanina ha'Gadol permitted splitting a verse only to help children learn, because there is no other solution!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel says that here also, there is no other solution.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>Shmuel didn't say like Rav, because we are concerned lest people who enter or leave in the middle think that the other person read only two verses (they do not know that a verse was repeated. A similar solution for Rosh Chodesh is if two Olim read (altogether) the first five verses (Rav would say to repeat verse three, Shmuel would divide verse three between the two), and the latter two Olim read five verses each. Other solutions are also possible.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A Parshah of six verses is read by two Olim. A Parshah of five verses is read by one Oleh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If (b'Di'eved) one read three verses of the five, the next Oleh reads the remaining two and one of the next Parshah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Some say that he reads three of the next Parshah, since we do not start less than three verses of a Parshah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>According to the opinion that we repeat, he should repeat! [According to the opinion that we break (read a partial verse), he should break!] (The texts of Rashi and Tosfos omit what is in brackets.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, it is possible without this. (The Beraisa discusses Monday and Thursday. We can read from the next Parshah, for it is also appropriate for the day. Regarding Ma'amados, the next Parshah pertains to the following day.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Tanchum):</span> The Halachah follows the second opinion in the Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Tanchum):</span> Just as we don't begin less than three verses in a Parshah, we do not end less than three verses before a Parshah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious! The first Tana is lenient to start less than three verses in a Parshah, and the second Tana is stringent about this. The first Tana is stringent not to leave less than three verses in a Parshah, all the more so the second Tana is stringent!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have thought that one may leave less than three because people rarely leave during Keri'as ha'Torah, so there is no concern (that someone will think that the last person read only two).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The first Tana forbids to leave less than three lest people leave in the middle. He should likewise forbid to begin less than three verses of a Parshah, lest one who enters during the Kri'ah think that the Olah read less than three!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One who enters asks what happened before.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The Halachah is that the middle person repeats a verse.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HOW MANY READ ON A TA'ANIS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How many read on a Ta'anis?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah said that four read on days with Musaf. Ta'aneisim do not have a Korban Musaf, but there is an additional prayer (Rashi - Aneinu; Me'iri - Ne'ilah. Rashi himself (Ta'anis 26a DH Ne'ilas) says that it was the custom to pray Ne'ilah on every Ta'anis)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mishnah said that four read on Rosh Chodesh and Chol ha'Moed. It did not include Ta'aneisim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Mishnah said that three read on Monday, Thursday and Shabbos afternoon, but it did not include Ta'aneisim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We cannot bring a proof from the Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rav came to Bavel on a Ta'anis. He blessed before reading in the Torah, but not after reading. Everyone fell on his face (when saying Tachanun), but Rav did not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav is a Yisrael, so he read third. He did not bless afterwards because someone else would read after him!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No Rav read first, like Rav Huna used to.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Huna read first, because even the greatest Kohanim of Eretz Yisrael were submissive to him. Rav showed honor to Shmuel, who was a Kohen, so Rav would not read first!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel was submissive to Rav. Rav showed honor to Shmuel, but only when Shmuel was around.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> Surely he read first, for it says that he blessed before reading!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps this was after the enactment that everyone blesses.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he should have blessed afterwards as well!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In Rav's area people did not leave during the reading, so there was no need for everyone to bless after reading.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The rule is, any day on which people may work, such as Ta'aneisim and Tish'ah b'Av, three people read. On days when people do not work, such as Rosh Chodesh and Chol ha'Moed, four read.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> On any day that has Musaf and is not Yom Tov, four read.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(The Mishnah explicitly teaches about Rosh Chodesh and Chol ha'Mo'ed. Surely,) this rule comes to include Ta'aneisim  and Tish'ah b'Av, which have Musaf, i.e. Tefilas Aneinu is added!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> If so, the Mishnah is unlike both of the following Tana'im!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Tish'ah b'Av falls on Monday or Thursday, three read and one is Maftir. If it falls on another day, one reads and one is Maftir;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Yosi says, in either case, three read and one is Maftir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Seemingly Rav Ashi is refuted, but how do we answer his question?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The rule in the Mishnah teaches about Rosh Chodesh and Chol ha'Moed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> These were taught explicitly!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana merely gives a way to remember the law, lest people equate Chol ha'Moed with Yom Tov. Rather, the rule is that any day that has an attribute over another day has an additional reader. Therefore:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is Musaf on Rosh Chodesh and Chol ha'Moed, so four read;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Melachah is forbidden on Yom Tov, so five read;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Yom Kipur is punishable by Kares, so six read;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>(Melachah on) Shabbos is punishable by stoning, so seven read.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>FALLING ON ONE'S FACE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rav came to Bavel on the day of a Ta'anis Tzibur. He read in the Sefer Torah. Before reading he blessed, but not after reading.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> All fell on their faces, but Rav did not. Why didn't he?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There was a stone floor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Even Maskis Lo Sitnu <i>b'Artzechem</i> Lehishtachavos Aleha" - you may not bow on your stone floor, but you may bow on the floor of the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did the others fall on their faces?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Only the floor in front of Rav was made of stone.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav move to their place, so he could fall on his face?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did not want to impose on them to stand up for him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rav used to spread his hands and feet when he fell on his face.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> The Torah forbids only to spread the hands and feet.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should have fallen on his face without spreading his hands and feet!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did not want to change his custom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> An important person is different.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> An important person may not fall on his face unless he is sure that he will be answered, like Yehoshua - "Va'Yomer Hash-m El Yehoshua Kum Lech... " (Rashi in Ta'anis (14b) says that Yehoshua was answered. Here he says that Yehoshua was not answered. Perhaps Rashi means, in <i>this</i> matter you will not be answered (Sefas Emes). Alternatively, we learn from Hash-m's rebuke that an important person may not fall on his face unless he will surely be answered.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Kidah" is (bowing) on one's face - "Va'Tikad Bas Sheva Apayim Artzah";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Kri'ah" is on the knees - "mi'Kro'ah Al Birkav."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Hishtachava'ah" is spreading hands and feet - "... Lehishtachavos Lecha Artzah".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Levi demonstrated Kidah to Rebbi, and this caused him to become limp.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There was a different cause!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> One should never speak harshly towards Hash-m. A great person did so and became limp, i.e. Levi!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both caused him to become limp.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> I saw Abaye and Rava lean on their sides (since important people may not fall on their faces unless they are sure that they will be answered).</p></div>
