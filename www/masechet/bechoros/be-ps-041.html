<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE ABOVE MUMIM ARE PROPER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We rely on these Mumim (taught until now) to slaughter a Bechor (outside the Beis ha'Mikdash) and to redeem Pesulei ha'Mukdashim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The first Mishnah of our Perek already teaches this. It says "we rely on the following Mumim to slaughter a Bechor... "!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Our Mishnah permits redeeming Pesulei ha'Mukdashim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious. if a Bechor may be slaughtered, all the more so Pesulei ha'Mukdashim may be redeemed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, because Chachamim did not (initially) agree with Ila's additional three Mumim, and subsequent Mumim were taught in the name of individuals, it was not clear that Chachamim agree with them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Therefore, our anonymous Mishnah permits slaughtering and redeeming based on any of them. (This shows that this is the Halachah.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MUMIM THAT ONLY POSEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Korban has any of the following Mumim, it may not be slaughtered in or outside the Mikdash:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chavarvar or dripping water (from the eye) that are not Kavu'im, inner Chutin (gums or teeth) that are Chaserim, but not uprooted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Garav (rash), wart, or Chazazis (boil);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The animal is old, sick, or putrid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>One witness or the owner testifies that it was used for bestiality or killed a person.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Tumtum (its genitals are covered, we cannot tell its gender) or Androginus (it has male and female genitals) may not be slaughtered in or outside the Mikdash;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yishmael says, this (Androginus; some say also Tumtum) is the ultimate Mum!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Chachamim say, it has no Kedushas Bechor. One may shear it and work with it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Questions:</span> Garav and Chazazis are proper Mumim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Garav is explicit in the Torah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Garav" is (a wart as hard as) Cheres (earthenware). "Yalefes" is Chazazis ha'Mitzris (sores, pimples or scabs).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> It is called Yalefes because it is Melafefes (clings) to one until he dies.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> Chazazis ha'Mitzris is a proper Mum. Our Mishnah discusses regular Chazazis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 2:</span> The Torah refers to dry Garav, which is a proper Mum. Our Mishnah discusses a moist Garav, which can heal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Moist Garav cannot heal. It says "... bi'Shechin Mitzrayim (... uva'Garav uve'Chares Asher Lo Suchal l'Herafei)";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since Chares is dry (like Cheres), Garav must be moist. The Torah says that it cannot be healed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are three kinds of boils. (Only the type that is moist on the inside can be healed):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Garav in the Parshah of Mumim is dry on the inside and outside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Garav of our Mishnah is moist on the inside and outside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Shechin Mitzrayim was dry on the inside and moist outside. It says "va'Yehi Shechin <i>Avabu'os Pore'ach.</i>" (The outer part was fluidy.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The animal is old, sick, or putrid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "<i>Min</i> ha'Tzon... <i>Min</i> ha'Kesavim Oh <i>Min</i> ha'Izim" exclude (disqualify to the Mizbe'ach) an old, sick, or putrid animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>Three (words in the verse that are expounded to be) exclusions are needed to disqualify them:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had the verse disqualified only an old animal, one might have thought that this is because it will not heal, but a sick animal is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it disqualified only a sick animal, one might have thought that this is because this is unnatural, but it is normal to grow old;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Had it written only two exclusions, we would have disqualified an old or sick animal, for they are weak, but not a putrid animal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Had it disqualified only a putrid animal, one might have thought that this is because it is disgusting, but the others are Kesherim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Therefore, three exclusions are needed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One witness or the owner testifies that it was used for bestiality...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Min ha'Behemah" excludes an animal used for (the male or female role in) bestiality;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Min ha'Bakar" excludes Ne'evad (an animal that was worshipped);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Min ha'Tzon" excludes Muktzah (an animal designated for idolatry);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"<i>U</i>'Min ha'Tzon" excludes an animal that killed a person.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If an animal was used for bestiality or killed a person, it is killed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> An animal is killed only through testimony of two witnesses. The case is, only one witness or the owner testified about it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TUMTUM AND ANDROGINUS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand why Tumtum may not be slaughtered in the Mikdash. Perhaps it is a female (and has no Kedushas Bechor);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It may not be slaughtered outside, for perhaps it is a male without a Mum;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We understand why Androginus may not be slaughtered in the Mikdash. Perhaps it is a female;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>However, why can't Androginus be slaughtered outside? Even if it is a male, it is "Charutz" (it has a crack, i.e. female genitals that should not be in a male). This is a Mum!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> "Oh Shavur Oh Charutz" equates these Mumim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like Shavur (broken) applies only to bones, also Charutz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> We do not need a Hekesh to teach that Charutz does not apply to (regular) flesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learned that "Garav" is Cheres (a Nega);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>(Regarding Tzara'as it says) "Mar'ehu Amok Min ha'Or." A sunlit area appears deeper than the shade; (The Chazon Ish asks that Garav need not resemble Tzara'as. Rather, we consider it is as if it was removed, therefore it is Charutz!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If Charutz applied to flesh, the Torah could have taught Charutz, and we would learn Garav from a Kal va'Chomer:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Charutz is not disgusting, yet it is a Mum; Garav is disgusting, all the more so it is a Mum!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Since the Torah wrote "Garav," we conclude that Charutz does not apply to flesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yishmael):</span> This (Androginus, and possibly also Tumtum) is the ultimate Mum!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yishmael argues with Abaye (who says that female genitals in a male are not a Mum). He does not equate Shavur with Charutz;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He argues with Rava. Granted, a crack in flesh is not a Mum where it is not noticed, but in a place where it is noticed, it is "Mum Ra."</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">41b----------------------------------------41b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Why does R. Yishmael disqualify Androginus?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Is he sure that it is a (male, hence a) Bechor, and it has a Mum;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps he is unsure. He teaches that even if it is a Bechor, it has a Mum!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If it is a Bechor, (then even though it has a Mum) one who shears it or works with it is lashed, and it must be given to a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa - R. Ilai citing R. Yishmael):</span> Androginus is a Bechor, and it has a Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This shows that he is sure that it is a Bechor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps he is unsure. He teaches that even if you will say that it is a Bechor, it has a Mum!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> (Olah must be) "Zachar", and not a female;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Another verse requires Olah to be "Zachar". What do we learn from it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It excludes Tumtum and Androginus.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is the first Tana of our Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He is unsure whether Androginus is a male or female. A verse would not teach about such a Safek! (If they are truly females, they are already excluded from the first verse "Zachar".)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is Chachamim (of the Seifa).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Regarding Bechor, it says "Zachar" only once. This suffices for them to exclude female, Tumtum and Androginus. (They would not need two verses regarding Olah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> It is R. Yishmael.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, if he is sure that it is a male, a verse must disqualify it;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>However, if he is unsure about its gender, a verse would not teach about such a Safek!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (and defense of Answer #2):</span> Really, it is Chachamim of the Seifa.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>There are also two verses regarding Bechor. It says "ha'Zachar" and "ha'Zecharim."</p></div>
