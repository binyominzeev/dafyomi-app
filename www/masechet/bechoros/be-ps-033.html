<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO MAY EAT <i>BECHOR</i>? (cont).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Beis Hillel hold that this applies only to a Tam Bechor. A Ba'al Mum may be eaten "ka'Tzvi vecha'Ayal" (Chayos, which have no Kedushah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Tamei (Kohen) may not eat Kodshei Kalim, yet he may eat Bechor (Ba'al Mum). A (Tahor) Zar may eat Kodshei Kalim, all the more so he may eat Bechor!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from a Tamei, for Tum'ah is permitted for Korbanos Tzibur (if they cannot be brought b'Taharah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not learn from offering b'Tum'ah, rather, from eating. (We never find something permitted to a Tamei Kohen and forbidden to a Zar.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Akiva permits even Nochrim. What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ka'Tzvi vecha'Ayal" - just like deer and wild goats are permitted to Nochrim, also a Bechor Ba'al Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Beis Hillel (in the Beraisa) argue?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Three verses mention Tzvi va'Ayal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One of them teaches the laws of R. Yitzchak and R. Oshaya. (Tosfos - one who works with Pesulei ha'Mukdashim after it was redeemed or mates it (even with its own species) is lashed. The Torah considers it like two different species, "ka'Tzvi vecha'Ayal");</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One of them teaches like R. Elazar Hakapar expounded (that Chayos must be slaughtered, just like animals);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The third teaches that just like Bechorah does not apply to Tzvi va'Ayal, it does not apply to Pesulei ha'Mukdashim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>(Beraisa - Beis Shamai) A Nidah may not eat Bechor (Ba'al Mum);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Beis Hillel permit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Beis Shamai learn from "u'Vesaram Yihyeh Lach... " Just like a Nidah may not eat Chazeh v'Shok, she may not eat Bechor;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Beis Hillel say that applies only to a Tam Bechor. Regarding a Ba'al Mum it says "ha'Tamei veha'Tahor Yachdav"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Shamai say, that permits only a Tamei whose Tum'ah does not come from his own body. We find that the Torah distinguishes whether or not the Tum'ah come from his own body!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When Korban Pesach is brought b'Tum'ah (because most of Yisrael or the Kohanim are Teme'im), the following Teme'im may not eat it: a Zav, Metzora, Zavah or Yoledes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Beis Hillel:</span> Korban Pesach is different. There the Torah permitted only "Tamei la'Nefesh" (Tum'as Mes);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Regarding Bechor, it permits "Tamei" without distinction.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DISGRACE TO <i>KODSHIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> On Yom Tov one may not be Margil (flay an animal from the legs, in order to keep the skin whole, in order to make a bellows or pouch);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Similarly, one may not be Margil a Bechor or Pesulei ha'Mukdashim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand why it is forbidden on Yom Tov. Even though one may flay in order to eat on Yom Tov, flaying in this way is an exertion not needed for Yom Tov;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, which Tana forbids Hargalah of a Bechor?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is Beis Shamai, who forbid Bechor to a Nidah (because it retains its Kedushah, even after Shechitah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Tana forbids Hargalah of Pesulei ha'Mukdashim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon (who holds that it retains its Kedushah, even after Shechitah):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven designated two animals for Acharayus for his Chatas (in case one will be lost, he will offer the other), and one of them became a Ba'al Mum:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He offers the Tam, and redeems the Ba'al Mum. (The money is used for Nidvos Tzibur, voluntary offerings when the Mizbe'ach is idle);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If (after Pidyon) the Ba'al Mum was slaughtered before Zerikas Dam of the Tam, it is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>If the Ba'al Mum was slaughtered after Zerikah, it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon says, even if the meat of the Ba'al Mum was in a bowl and Zerikah (of the Tam) was done, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav Chisda establish the entire Mishnah to be like Beis Shamai?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps Beis Shamai hold that only Bechor retains its Kedushah, for it is Kodesh from birth, but other Pesulei ha'Mukdashim do not.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">33b----------------------------------------33b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav Chisda establish the entire Mishnah to be like R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon holds that Pesulei ha'Mukdashim retain their Kedushah after Shechitah, for their Kedushah is strong enough to be Matpis Pidyonam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Kedushah of Bechor is too weak to be Matpis Pidyono, so it does not retain its Kedushah after Shechitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Elazar argue with our Mishnah, which permits selling Pesulei ha'Mukdashim in an Itliz and by weight?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah allows a disgrace to Hekdesh for the sake of a monetary gain to Hekdesh. R. Elazar forbids Hargalah, even though it increases the redemption value!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Mari brei d'Rav Kahana):</span> R. Elazar could agree with our Mishnah. Hargalah increases the value of the skin, but not the total (redemption) value (Rashi - very much), for it cuts the meat, and decreases its value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> R. Elazar could agree with our Mishnah. Hargalah is forbidden for it is a big disgrace. It looks like working with Kodshim. (He flays for the sake of the skin, not in order to eat.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yosi bar Avin):</span> He could agree with our Mishnah. He decrees to forbid Hargalah, lest one delay slaughtering Pesulei ha'Mukdashim (until finding one who wants to buy the skin), and grow herds of them. (Perhaps he will come to shear or work them.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BLOODLETTING A <i>BECHOR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If a Bechor is sick due to excess blood, even if it will die, one may not let blood;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim permit letting blood, as long as he does not (expect to) make a Mum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Mum was made, one may not slaughter it (outside the Mikdash) until it gets another Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon permits letting blood, even if this will make a Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a Bechor is sick due to excess blood, one may let blood, but only in a place that will not make a Mum;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Chachamim permit even in a place that will make a Mum, but onet may not slaughter it until it gets another Mum;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Shimon permits relying on that Mum to slaughter it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Yehudah says, even if it will die, one may not let blood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The argument about bloodletting is like the argument about Terumah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Terumah became doubtfully Tamei:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Eliezer says, if it was in an open place (prone to become definitely Tamei), we put it in a hidden place. If it was exposed, we cover it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yehoshua says, if it was in a hidden place, we put it in an open place. If it was covered, we expose it. (We want it to become definitely Tamei, for then it may be used. E.g. a Kohen may benefit from burning it, or he may spray wine on the floor to give a nice aroma.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>R. Gamliel says, we leave it like it is.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir holds like R. Eliezer, Chachamim hold like R. Yehoshua, and R. Yehudah holds like R. Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> This is not necessarily true!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir forbids overtly making a Mum. Perhaps he would permit <i>causing</i> Tum'ah, like R. Yehoshua;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer requires guarding Safek Terumah from definite Tum'ah. Perhaps this is because we anticipate that Eliyahu will come soon, and he will tell us that it is really Tahor. However, R. Eliezer would permit letting blood from a Bechor like Chachamim, lest it die!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim permit letting blood, lest it die. Perhaps they require guarding the Terumah like R. Eliezer, for Eliyahu might tell us that it is Tahor!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yehudah forbids overtly making a Mum. Perhaps he would permit <i>causing</i> Tum'ah, like R. Yehoshua.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Gamliel forbids changing its status. Perhaps this is because we anticipate Eliyahu, but he would permit letting blood, lest the Bechor die!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> (Regarding Bechor) the Tana'im argue about a verse:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> (Regarding Menachos,) all agree that one is liable for Mechametz (fermenting) after Mechametz. It says "Lo Se'aseh Chametz" and "Lo Se'afeh Chametz" (to make a person liable for every step);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>All agree that one is liable for Mesares (castrating) after Mesares. It says "u'Ma'uch v'Chasus v'Nasuk v'Charus" (the verse discusses Mumim of castration. It ends "... uv'Artzechem Lo Sa'asu");</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one is liable for Kores (disconnecting the testicles), all the more so for Nosek (Tosfos - totally cutting them off, but they are still in the sac; Rashi - removing them from the sac). Why did the Torah need to say "v'Nasuk"?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This obligates for Nosek after Kores.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>They argue only about making a Mum in a Ba'al Mum;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Meir is Mechayev due to "Kol Mum Lo Yihyeh Bo";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim exempt. It says "Tamim Yihyeh l'Ratzon." (Since a Ba'al Mum cannot be (offered) l'Ratzon, the Lav of making a Mum does not apply.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Meir expound Chachamim's verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It excludes a Ba'al Mum me'Ikaro. (It was blemished before it became Kodesh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Such an animal was never Kosher to be offered. Obviously the Lav does not apply!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, it excludes Pesulei ha'Mukdashim after Pidyon:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since one may not work with or shear them, one might have thought that also the Isur to blemish them remains. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim expound R. Meir's verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It forbids causing a Mum:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We read "Kol Mum Lo <i>Yihyeh</i> Bo" like "(Lo) Yehayei" (do not directly cause - Tosfos Yom Tov; Rashash - "(Lo) Yehayeh" there shall not be) a Mum;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to forbid causing a Mum, e.g. sticking food to the ear (inciting dogs to eat the food, and thereby cut the ear)?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It could have said only "Mum". "<i>Kol</i> Mum" is extra, to equate making a Mum and causing a Mum.</p>
