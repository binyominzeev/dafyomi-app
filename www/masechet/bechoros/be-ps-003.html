<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE FINE FOR SELLING AN ANIMAL TO A <i>NOCHRI</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, they discuss giving a fetus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> It says "he is fined 10 times b'Damav." (R. Gershom - this is masculine. It must discuss a fetus. Maharsha - it is unreasonable to fine 10 times for giving a female for its offspring. Rashi's text says "he gives its full value to a Kohen." There is no reason to give the mother to a Kohen.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> This supports Reish Lakish.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If one sold a large animal to a Nochri, he is fined. He must buy it back for up to 10 times its value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this precise? (Must he pay even more? Alternatively - is this an exaggeration?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehoshua ben Levi taught that if one sold a slave to a Nochri, he is fined. He must buy it back for up to 100 times its value. (Rashi - each of these is precise. If not, both of them would have taught the same number. Shitah Mekubetzes - surely, the same fine applies to an animal. Ten is not precise.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the fine for an animal is (even) smaller. It is not like selling a slave, for that prevents the slave from being able to keep Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - (Reish Lakish):</span> If one sold a large animal to a Nochri, he is fined. He must buy it back for up to 100 times its value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If he gave to a Nochri b'Kabalah, even though this is forbidden, he is fined 10 times its value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The fine is bigger for an absolute sale than for giving b'Kabalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reish Lakish says 100. Is this precise?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehoshua ben Levi taught that if one sold a slave to a Nochri, he is fined. He must buy it back for up to 10 times its value. (Rashi - surely, the fine for an animal is not greater than for a slave; 100 is an exaggeration; Shitah Mekubetzes - just like 10 for a slave is not precise (surely, it is no less than for an animal), 100 is not precise (one must pay more).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Perhaps the fine for an animal is larger, because he gets to keep the animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection of rejection:</span> This justifies paying only one more times the value, but not 90 times more!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> It is unusual to sell a slave to Nochrim, Chachamim did not fine (so much) in unusual cases.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PARTIAL OWNERSHIP OF A <i>NOCHRI</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chachamim):</span> Whenever a Nochri has a share...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Both Tana'im expound the same verse - "Chol Bechor."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Possibility #1:</span> Chachamim hold that "Bechor" connotes even a partial Bechor (i.e. part lacks Kedushas Bechor, because it is owned by a Nochri). "Chol" requires it to be a full Bechor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah holds that "Bechor" connotes a full Bechor. "Chol" includes even a partial Bechor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Possibility #2:</span> All agree that "Bechor" connotes that the majority has Kedushas Bechor:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim hold that "Chol" requires it to be a full Bechor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah holds that "Chol" includes even a minority Bechor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (According to Chachamim,) how much must a Nochri own to exempt it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> Even if he owns an ear it is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> Even if the ear would be cut off and given to the Nochri, the remainder would (be blemished, but still) have Kedushas Bechor! (It must be given to a Kohen. One may not work with it, shear it, or sell it in the market.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Chisda):</span> If removal of the Nochri's share would make it Nevelah, it is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> If removal of the Nochri's share would make it Treifah, it is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Rava and Rav Chisda argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about whether or not a Treifah can live (R. Gershom - for 12 months):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava holds that it cannot;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Chisda holds that it can. Therefore, the Nochri's share is not essential unless its removal would make it Nevelah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> Rav Chisda and Rava do not argue with Rav Huna. They say how much a Nochri must own of the mother to exempt. Rav Huna says how much he must own of the fetus to exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Papa):</span> Presumably, you say that any (Nochri) ownership in the fetus exempts, because this is not "Kol Bechor";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If so, any ownership also in the mother should exempt, because this is not "v'Chol Miknecha Tizachar"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, there is no distinction between the mother and the fetus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (against all three answers - Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> Why is this different than Nefalim (non-viable offspring)? They get Kedushas Bechor, even though they have no life at all!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"(Kedushas Bechor applies to) Peter <i>Sheger</i> Behemah." This is a fetus that was born prematurely (alternatively - a miscarriage).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, the entire fetus is proper for Kedushas Bechor. This is "bi'Vehemah Kol Bechor." Here, there is a mixture of Chulin (the Nochri's share). The verse does not apply.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IS A DEVIATION A <i>MUM</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">R. Asi (to R. Elazar):</span> (When you were not in the Beis Medrash,) R. Yochanan taught a law and explained a Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">3b----------------------------------------3b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If removal of the Nochri's share would make even a minor Mum (blemish), it is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a sheep gave birth to a goat, or vice-versa, it is (a Nidmeh, i.e. the child does not resemble the mother. It is) exempt from Bechorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the child resembles its mother in some ways, it has Kedushas Bechor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> (Since it primarily resembles another species,) this is a Kavu'a (permanent) Mum. It may be slaughtered (outside the Mikdash, like Chulin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, the first teaching is a Chidush. It is like Rav Huna, and unlike Rav Chisda and Rava. (Ramban - some say that it is not exactly like Rav Huna, who exempts even if removal of the Nochri's share would not make any Mum.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, it is no Chidush to say that a partial Nidmeh is a Mum Kavu'a. A Mishnah teaches that any deviation is a Mum!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If its mouth resembles a swine's mouth, this is a Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps that is a Mum because it resembles something that has no Kedushas Bechor, but if it resembles a sheep or goat (even though this is unlike its mother), this is not a Mum!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Mishnah (according to a Beraisa that explains it) refutes this!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one eye was big or one eye was small, this is a Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This refers to an eye (of a Seh) as big as that of a calf or as small as that of a goose.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Granted, geese have no Kedushas Bechor, but calves do. Surely, an eye as big as a calf's is a Mum because it is a deviation!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the Mishnah refers to the Mum of Sharu'a (one limb of a pair is bigger than its counterpart).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> These Mumim (of animals, listed in the sixth Perek), whether Over (temporary) or Kavu'a, disqualify a Kohen from Avodah. In addition, if a Kohen's eyes are too big or too small, he is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Big or small eyes disqualifies a Kohen, for it says "Ish Ish mi'Zera Aharon." A Kohen must be similar to other descendants of Aharon (like regular people);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Big or small eyes do not disqualify an animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is an animal Pasul if it has one big or one small eye?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If any deviation is a Mum, even two big or small eyes should disqualify!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is (the Mum called) "Sharu'a."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (of the answer and the support) :</span> Really, the deviation disqualifies;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Two big or small eyes does not disqualify, because it is due to the animal being healthy or weak!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We cannot attribute one big or small eye to being healthy or weak. If so, both should be the same!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>EXEMPTING FROM <i>BECHORAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A case occurred in which a Nochri gave an animal to his sister, who was a convert, to fatten it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> No one is concerned for R. Yehudah's opinion that partnership of a Nochri does not exempt from Bechorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rav Mari bar Rachel had a flock. He used to be Makneh (transfer ownership of) the ears to a Nochri, yet he would forbid working (with the Bechoros) and would give them to Kohanim. His flock died out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since he would forbid working with them and give them to Kohanim, why did he give the ears to a Nochri?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was concerned for Takalah (lest someone slaughter it by mistake).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did his flock die out?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It was a punishment for uprooting Kedushas Bechor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Yehudah permits blemishing a Bechor before it leaves the womb (even though this uproots the Kedushah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This disqualifies it from Hakravah, but the Mitzvah to give it to a Kohen remains. Rav Mari uprooted the entire Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rav Mari caused a Takalah. He knew how to be Makneh to a Nochri, but onlookers, who did not know the proper way, would be Makneh in an invalid way (and mistakenly think that the Bechor is not Kodesh. Rashi - they thought that he was Makneh verbally. Really, the Nochri paid money; Tosfos - he was Makneh the mother for the sake of acquiring the fetus' ear. Others would be Makneh the ear of the fetus. This does not take effect, for it is Lo Ba l'Olam (not yet in the world). Shitah Mekubetzes - he told the Nochri to do Meshichah on a pregnant mother to acquire the fetus' ear. People would do this before the mother was pregnant. R. Gershom - one of his adult children would Mezakeh (acquire) on behalf of the Nochri. Others would be Mezakeh through a minor.)</p>
