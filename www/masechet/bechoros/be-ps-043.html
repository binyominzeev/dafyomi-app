<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Yabeles is not written regarding people. Dak and Tavlul are not written regarding animals;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>We must say that this is Mufneh (the words are superfluous, they are written only for the Gezeirah Shavah). If not, we could challenge it!</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah could have written only "Yalefes," and we would know that all the more so "Garav" is a Mum, for it is more repulsive. (Rashi - it is dry, and it makes cracks; R. Gershom - it is moist and runny);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"Garav" was written solely to make the verse Mufneh for the Gezeirah Shavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Why are some Mumim mentioned regarding people <i>and</i> animals?)

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it listed the Mumim regarding people (and only Garav and Yalefes regarding animals), we would have thought that only these two disqualify animals, but Mumim that do not apply to people, such as uncloven feet or Mumim of the Chutim (gums, or teeth), do not apply to animals;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn (Mumim of) Bechor or Kodshim from (those of) man, for the Torah gave many Mitzvos to people;</p></div>
