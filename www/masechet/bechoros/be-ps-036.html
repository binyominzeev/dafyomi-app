<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TESTIMONY OF <i>ED MI'PI ED</i> ABOUT A <i>BECHOR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is Ed mi'Pi Ed (one who testifies about what he heard from someone else) acceptable for Bechor (to say that a Mum was not made intentionally)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Asi):</span> It is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> It is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Asi against Rav Ashi - Beraisa - Tana d'Vei Menasheh):</span> Ed mi'Pi Ed is Kosher only for Edus Ishah (to testify that a man died to permit his wife to remarry).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> It means, it is Kosher only for Edus (testimony) that an Ishah may give. (Women may testify about Bechoros.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rav Yemar was Machshir Ed mi'Pi Ed for Edus Bechor. Mereimar derided him for this.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE WHO ESTABLISHED THE <i>ISUR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ila'a):</span> (Normally, when a Kohen asks a Chacham to inspect a Mum, he must bring someone else to testify that the Mum came by itself.) If a Kohen says that an animal is a Bechor, and we would not have known this otherwise, he is believed to say that the Mum came by itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He teaches that ha'Peh she'Asar Hu ha'Peh she'Hitir (if Ploni said that something was forbidden, and we have no other source for this, he is believed to say things that (totally or partially) permit it). We already learn this from a Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman said, "I was married, then I was divorced" (and we had not known that she was ever married), she is believed, for ha'Peh she'Asar Hu ha'Peh she'Hitir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that there she is believed, for she could have kept quiet, but a Kohen cannot be quiet about a Bechor, for he needs a Chacham to (inspect the Mum and) permit it, since he does not want to (slaughter it and) eat Kodshim outside the Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Ila'a teaches that he is believed. One who would intentionally blemish a Bechor would make an overt blemish (he transgresses a Lav, but then mid'Oraisa it is permitted to slaughter and eat it). He would not need to ask a Chacham about it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> Why is this unlike the following?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven rented his donkey to Shimon, warning him not to go near the Pekod river, for it is wet there. Shimon went there, and the donkey died. Shimon said that it was dry there.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> We believe him. If he wanted to lie, he could have said that he did not go there!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> We do not apply Migo (to believe someone because if he wanted to lie, he could have said a better lie) against witnesses. (We all know that it is wet by the river, it is as if we are witnesses! Similarly, we know that the Kohen is suspected of making the Mum!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, we are sure that it is wet near the river. Here, we merely <i>suspect</i> that he made the Mum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Migo suffices to quell our suspicion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> If a Kohen says that an animal is a Bechor, and we did not know this, he is believed about the Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava Zuti):</span> We learned this in the name of R. Ila'a.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Tzadok had a Bechor. He put barley for it in a basket of peeled willow branches (with sharp edges). Its lip became cut through eating.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Tzadok):</span> (A regular Kohen is suspected of making a Mum.) Is the law of a Chaver different?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yehoshua):</span> Yes. (We believe that you did not intend for this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Gamliel):</span> No (you are not believed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">R. Tzadok:</span> R. Yehoshua said yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> Wait until the shield-bearers (Rashi - Chachamim; Aruch - soldiers) enter the Beis Medrash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>The shield-bearers entered. R. Tzadok asked his question, and R. Yehoshua answered "no."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> I heard that you answered "yes"! Stand up, (others will testify about what you said (before) - Tosfos deletes this from the text).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> I cannot deny it. (Rashi - I retract from what I had said; Tosfos - he did not retract. R Gershom - he did not want to rule in front of R. Gamliel.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>R. Gamliel was expounding, R. Yehoshua was standing; people were murmuring (about the mistreatment of R. Yehoshua). They told Chutzpis (who was broadcasting the Shi'ur) to stop. He stopped.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SITUATIONS IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE BELIEVED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Kohen is believed to say "a Chacham ruled that this Bechor is a Ba'al Mum."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> A Kohen is believed to say "a Yisrael gave this Bechor to me. It already had a Mum."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People do not lie about a Milsa d'Avida l'Igluyei (something that is prone to become known).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> A Kohen is believed to say "a Chacham ruled that this Bechor is a Ba'al Mum."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is because people do not lie about a Milsa d'Avida l'Igluyei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. He is believed that it is a proper Mum because we do not suspect lest he (slaughter it and) eat Kodshim outside the Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do suspect lest he himself blemish a Bechor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shizbi - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven is not believed about Ma'aser, and Shimon sent him to buy produce from someone who is believed about or takes Ma'aser, Reuven is not trusted about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not say that this (whom he bought from) is Avida l'Igluyei, and Reuven would not lie about it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is different, Reuven can say (about anyone) "I consider him trustworthy."</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">36b----------------------------------------36b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Yehudah - Seifa of that Mishnah):</span> If Shimon said, "buy from Ploni," Reuven may be trusted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is believed because this (from whom he bought) is Avida l'Igluyei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That case is different, for Reuven fears lest ask Ploni.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah bar Aba):</span> Rav Yehudah heard his teaching from Gidul (a Chacham), who heard it from me;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I taught that a Yisrael is believed to say "I gave this Bechor to a Kohen. It already had a Mum."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious! (There is no reason for the Yisrael to lie about this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - Answer:</span> The case is, the Bechor was small when he gave it, and now it is old;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - R Gershom - Answer:</span> The case is, the Yisrael was a minor when he gave it, and now he is an adult; (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that he does not recognize (or remember) the Bechor now. R. Yirmeyah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>In Sura, they taught the latter (R. Yirmeyah's) version. In Pumbadisa, they taught the first (Rav Yehudah's) version.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>The Halachah is even like the first version. (Even a Kohen is believed.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A <i>BECHOR</i> SHOWN TO A <i>CHACHAM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rafram had a Bechor. He gave it to a Kohen (Reuven) without a Mum. Reuven put a Mum in it. One day, Rafram's eyes were hurting. Reuven brought the Bechor to him, and said "a Yisrael gave it to me with this Mum." Rafram opened his eyes wide, and recognized that it was the same animal that he gave to him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rafram:</span> I gave this to you (unblemished)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rafram:</span> Even though Reuven is very brazen (to make a Mum, lie, and show it to me), other Kohanim are not. They are believed to say that a Yisrael gave to them a Bechor with a Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Ploni showed a (Bechor) Sharu'a (one eye was bigger than the other) to Rav Ashi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Is there anything we must be concerned for?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Obviously, the Mum came by itself. Whether Ploni is a Yisrael or a Kohen, he is believed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Perhaps he is a Yisrael. Rav Yehudah taught that we do not permit a Bechor to a Yisrael unless a Kohen is with him (lest the Yisrael keep the Bechor for himself)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Rav Yehudah's law applies to a Mum that is not obvious. Even a Yisrael suspected to keep the Bechor for himself (which is theft) would show it to a Chacham, for he does not want to (slaughter it and) eat Kodshim outside the Mikdash. (One who does so is Chayav Kares);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sharu'a is an obvious Mum. Ploni showed it to me (to fulfill Chachamim's decree) to honor the Chacham. One who is concerned for the honor of Chachamim is not suspected of theft!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>EVERYONE IS BELIEVED ABOUT <i>MA'ASER</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Everyone is believed about a Mum in Ma'aser Behemah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If one wanted to blemish an animal of Ma'aser, he could have put a Mum in it before making it Ma'aser. (This was permitted, for it was Chulin.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> He does not know which will come out the tenth!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He will cause the blemished one to come out tenth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Lo Yevaker" forbids causing a Ba'al Mum (or Tam) to come out tenth!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He could have blemished his entire herd before tithing.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>TO WHOM MUST <i>MUMIM</i> BE SHOWN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Bechor's eye was blinded, its foreleg was cut off, or its hind leg was broken, three commoners can permit it (to be slaughtered);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi says even a Sanhedrin of 23 cannot permit it. Only an expert can.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Simlai, R. Yehudah Nesi'ah and R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Three commoners can permit a Bechor in Chutz la'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> They refer to a clearcut Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learn this from our Mishnah. It allows three commoners only for clearcut Mumim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that in Chutz la'Aretz, three commoners suffice even for questionable Mumim, and the Mishnah discusses clearcut Mumim to show the extremity of R. Yosi's opinion. (He requires an expert even for them);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah bar Aba, citing Rav or Shmuel):</span> Three commoners can permit a Mum in a place where there is no expert.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learn this from our Mishnah. It allows three commoners to permit a Mum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that this is even in a place where there is an expert. R. Yirmeyah teaches that this is only where there is no expert.</p>
