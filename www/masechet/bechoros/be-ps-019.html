<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A PARTIAL BECHOR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Tarfon):</span> If a firstborn was born Yotzei Dofen (through Caesarian section), and the next animal (from this mother) was born normally, both of them graze until they get a Mum, then the owner eats them;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Akiva says, neither is a Bechor;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first is not a Bechor because it is not Peter Rechem (the first to leave the womb);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The second is not a Bechor because another animal was born to this mother before it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Tarfon is unsure whether a partial Bechor (i.e. in only one respect, it was the first offspring <i>or</i> the Peter Rechem) is a Bechor. R. Akiva is sure that it is not a Bechor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the method of expounding Klal ha'Tzarich li'Frat (a general term that cannot be understood without a specific term) and a Prat ha'Tzarich li'Chlal (a specific term that cannot be understood without a general term)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - Suggestion #1:</span> Perhaps "Kadesh Li Chol Bechor" includes females!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Zachar."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion #2:</span> Perhaps "Zachar" teaches that the first male born is a Bechor, even if females were born before it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Peter Rechem."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion #3:</span> Perhaps "Peter Rechem" teaches that the first animal to leave the womb is a Bechor, even if a previous animal was born Yotzei Dofen!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Bechor."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheravya):</span> The Tana did not refute Suggestion #2 by saying that a male born after a female is not "Bechor". This implies that a partial Bechor is a Bechor;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>To refute Suggestion #3, he says that an animal born after a Yotzei Dofen is not "Bechor". This implies that a partial Bechor is not a Bechor!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> He holds that a partial Bechor is not a Bechor;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Suggestion #2 really means 'perhaps "Zachar" teaches that if the firstborn is a male it is a Bechor, even if it was Yotzei Dofen!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> He holds that a partial Bechor is a Bechor. Even so, "Bechor" refutes Suggestion #3;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If an animal born after a Yotzei Dofen would get Kedushas Bechor, there would be no need for the Torah to write "Bechor"!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It is not needed to exclude when a female was born previously. Peter Rechem excludes this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> "Bechor" teaches that an animal born after a Yotzei Dofen does not get Kedushas Bechor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> If a partial Bechor is a Bechor, the simple meaning of "Bechor" does not exclude a partial Bechor, just it may be expounded to exclude (the most reasonable case to exclude);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Indeed, we would exclude a male born normally after a male Yotzei Dofen ("Bechor" is extra to exclude this case, for it is a Bechor with respect to the womb, but not with respect to males);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, we would not exclude a normal male after a female Yotzei Dofen (for the male is a Bechor with respect to the womb and with respect to males).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Rather, we must answer like Abaye.</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK HA'LOKE'ACH BEHEMAH</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN ARE WE CONCERNED FOR BECHORAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yishmael):</span> If Reuven bought an animal from a Nochri. and does not know whether it already gave birth (and now it gave birth to a male):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If (it was) a goat (and it) gave birth in its first year, he gives the kid to a Kohen. (It is surely a Bechor.) If it gave birth after this, it is a Safek. (It grazes until it gets a Mum, and then Reuven eats it);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If a sheep gave birth within two years, he gives the lamb to a Kohen. If it gave birth after this, it is a Safek;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If a cow gave birth within three years, he gives the calf to a Kohen. If it gave birth after this, it is a Safek;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> If the Halachah were that only a proper child exempts from Bechorah, you would be right;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, Chachamim taught that Tinuf (a dissolved fetus; alternatively, bubbles of blood) in a small animal is a sign of a (miscarried) child. (It exempts from Bechorah.) A Shilya (fetal sac) in a large animal is a sign of a child;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>In a woman, Shapir (skin in the form of a child) and Shilya are both Simanim of a child (regarding Tum'as Yoledes).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The general rule is, if we know that an animal previously gave birth (or miscarried), the Kohen does not receive anything (from the next birth);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If we know that it did not give birth before, the Bechor belongs to the Kohen;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If we do not know whether or not it gave birth before, the owner eats it when it gets a Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does R. Yishmael say that after one year, it is a Safek? The majority of goats become pregnant and give birth in their first year. We should follow the majority and say that a kid born after one year is definitely not a Bechor!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Yishmael holds like R. Meir, who is concerned for the minority.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He can hold like Chachamim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim follow a majority d'Isei Kaman (everything is in front of us), such as the majority opinion of judges on the Sanhedrin, or the majority of stores in the city (to determine whether meat found in the street is Kosher or Nevelah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They do not follow a majority d'Leisei Kaman (not in front of us, i.e. a statistical majority, e.g. that most goats in the world give birth in their first year).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Chachamim follow a majority d'Leisei Kaman regarding minors!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A (minor) boy or girl may not do Yibum or Chalitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> We agree that a minor may not do not Chalitzah. It says "Ish," and the Torah equates the Yevamah to the Yavam;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>However, why do you forbid Yibum?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> We are concerned lest he or she is a Seris or Ailonis (one who will not develop to be a normal male or female. In such a case, there is no Mitzvah of Yibum. The "Yibum" is merely marrying a sister-in-law, which is Chayavei Kerisus.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Chachamim are not concerned for this. They follow the majority (most people are normal).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion (Rava):</span> We must say that R. Yishmael holds like R. Meir.</p></div>
