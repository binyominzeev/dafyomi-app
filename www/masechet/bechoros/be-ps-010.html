<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>RAVA'S SOURCE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> I learn from a Beraisa;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following receive Tum'as Ochlim, even though they are Isurei Hana'ah:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Orlah, Kilai ha'Kerem, Shor ha'Niskal (an ox sentenced to be stoned), Eglah Arufah, Tziporei Metzora (he brings birds to permit him to enter the city), Peter Chamor, and Basar v'Chalav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says they do not receive Tum'as Ochlim, except for Basar v'Chalav, for it had Sha'as ha'Kosher (it was once permitted to Yisrael, when they were first mixed together, before they were cooked together).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> R. Shimon learns from "mi'Kol ha'Ochel Asher Ye'achel" - something is considered food (regarding Tum'as Ochlim) only if one may feed it to others (Nochrim. I.e., one may benefit from it, even if a Yisrael may not eat it).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is R. Shimon Metamei Basar v'Chalav due to She'as ha'Kosher? It suffices that one may feed it to others!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Yehudah citing R. Shimon):</span> One may not eat Basar v'Chalav, but one may benefit from it. It says "Ki Am Kodesh Atah (... Lo Sevashel Gedi ba'Chalev Imo)," similar to "v'Anshei Kodesh Tiheyun Li (u'Vasar ba'Sadeh Terefah Lo Sochelu)";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Just like one may benefit from a Terefah but not eat it, the same applies to Basar v'Chalav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon gives a second reason to be Metamei Basar v'Chalav;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Firstly, it is Tamei because one may feed it to others (he permits benefit from it). Secondly, it was once permitted to Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of Rava's source:</span> If R. Shimon permits benefit from Peter Chamor after Arifah, he should agree that it is Mekabel Tum'as Ochlim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If one intended to eat it, indeed R. Shimon would agree;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon is Metaher when there was no intent to eat it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If there was no intent, why are Chachamim Metamei?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabanan):</span> Isuro Chishuvo (the Torah forbids it, this shows that it is considered food)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes):</span> Do Chachamim really hold that Isuro Chishuvo?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are 13 laws of Nivlas Ohf Tahor (the Nevelah of a Tahor bird). One is, it requires intent (to eat it in order to receive Tum'as Ochlim, for normally people do not eat it);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>(Because it has a severe Tum'ah, i.e. it is Metamei one who eats it,) it does not require Hechsher for Tum'as Ochlim. (It is Mekabel Tum'ah even if no liquid was put on it. Some explain that it has Tum'as Ochlim even without touching Tum'ah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Isuro Chishuvo, it should receive Tum'as Ochlim without intent!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Mishnah is like R. Shimon. (He does not hold that Isuro Chishuvo.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> The following require intent, but they do not require Hechsher:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Nevelah of a Tamei (species of) animal, in any place;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Nivlas Ohf Tahor and Chelev in villages.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If Isuro Chishuvo, they should not require intent!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Also that Mishnah is also like R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> The following do not require intent (because some people eat them) nor Hechsher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Nevelah of a Tahor animal, in any place;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Nivlas Ohf Tahor and Chelev in markets.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Nevelah of a Tamei animal requires intent!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps also this is like R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Since the Seifa is like R. Shimon, the Reisha is not R. Shimon!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Seifa - R. Shimon):</span> Also a camel, hare and hyrax and pig do not need intent nor Hechsher.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> This is because each has one Siman of Kashrus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (c) - Rava):</span> No one holds that Isuro Chishuvo;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Arifah was done, all agree that it is Tahor;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They argue about Shechitah for the sake of practicing, like Nimus and R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Nimus):</span> If one slaughtered a raven to practice, its blood is Machshir;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Eliezer says, blood of Shechitah is always Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Nimus!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They argue about whether Isuro Chishuvo;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Nimus says that its blood is Machshir other food, but the raven itself is not Huchshar without intent. R. Eliezer says that blood of Shechitah is always Machshir. Even the raven is Huchshar without intent.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps R. Eliezer is Machshir because a raven has (two) Simanei Taharah! (There are four Simanim of Tamei birds, i.e. similarities to a Nesher. Every other Tamei species has at most three Simanei Tum'ah, and at least one Siman Taharah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Simanei Taharah affect Hechsher?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer: (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> (The camel, hare... do not need intent nor Hechsher;) this is because each has one Siman of Kashrus.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If R. Eliezer is Machshir due to Simanei Taharah, why does the Beraisa discuss Shechitah for practice? He should be Machshir even Mis'asek! (He was not intending to slaughter, and he slaughtered!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, he is Machshir even Mis'asek. The Beraisa discusses Shechitah for practice to teach the extremity of R. Nimus. Even though he intended to slaughter, it is not Machshir the bird.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If he did not want to give a Seh to a Kohen, he breaks its neck from the back with a Kopitz (chopping knife) and buries it. It is Asur b'Hana'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon permits benefit from it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This means that R. Yehudah forbids benefit mi'Chayim (while it is alive), and R. Shimon permits.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since the Seifa discusses mi'Chayim, the Reisha does not discuss mi'Chayim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Seifa - R. Yehudah):</span> He may not kill it with a reed, scythe, axe, or saw. He may not lock it in a room to die. One may not shear it or work with it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon permits.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The entire Beraisa discusses benefit mi'Chayim. The Reisha discusses benefit from its value (e.g. to rent it), the Seifa discusses benefit from it itself;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>It must teach both cases;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it taught only about benefit from its value, one might have thought that R. Shimon permits this, but forbids benefit from it itself;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it taught only about benefit from it itself, one might have thought that R. Yehudah forbids this, but permits benefit from its value.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>RAV NACHMAN'S TEACHING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Also Rav Nachman taught that R. Shimon agrees that Peter Chamor is Asur b'Hana'ah after Arifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rav Nachman for himself - Beraisa):</span> It says "va'Arafto" regarding Peter Chamor, like it says regarding Eglah Arufah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like there it is Asur b'Hana'ah (after Arifah), also here.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It cannot be R. Yehudah. He forbids benefit even mi'Chayim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 - Rav Safra):</span> Really, the Beraisa is R. Yehudah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that Arifah is in place of redemption. Just like it is permitted after redemption, also after Arifah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rav Nachman for himself - Levi - Beraisa):</span> Because the Yisrael deprived the Kohen (he refused to give a Seh), the Torah deprives him of his money (commands him to kill the Peter Chamor).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It cannot be R. Yehudah. He forbids benefit even mi'Chayim (Arifah does not deprive the Yisrael. He was already deprived!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Beraisa can be like either Tana. In any case it does not support Rav Nachman;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It can be like R. Yehudah. (The Yisrael could have redeemed the Peter Chamor for a Seh worth less than it, so) Arifah deprives him of the difference;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It can be like R. Shimon, and yet he may benefit from it after Arifah. Arifah deprives him of the difference in value (of a live donkey from a dead one).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> R. Shimon agrees that Peter Chamor is Asur b'Hana'ah after Arifah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He argues (and permits) also after Arifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2A - (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was Mekadesh Leah with a Peter Chamor, she is not Mekudeshes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is like R. Yehudah. According to R. Shimon, one may benefit from a Peter Chamor, so she would be Mekudeshes!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman):</span> The Chamor was given after Arifah. The Mishnah is even like R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2B - Question:</span> The Mishnah is not like R. Yehudah, nor like R. Shimon!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is not like R. Shimon. He permits benefit from a Peter Chamor. She would be Mekudeshes!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is not like R. Yehudah. He holds that she would be Mekudeshes with the net value she received, i.e. the value of the donkey less the cost (of a Seh) to redeem it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Avuha):</span> It is like R. Yehudah. The case is, the Peter Chamor is worth only one Shekel. (It has no net value, for) R. Yehudah holds like his son;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It says "Tifdeh" twice teaches that a Peter Chamor may be redeemed immediately, and it may be redeemed for (a Seh worth) any amount;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi bar Yehudah says, the (Seh for) redemption must be (worth) at least one Shekel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The first Tana learns that it may be redeemed immediately and for (a Seh worth) any amount because it says "Tifdeh" twice. This is obvious! (Why would we think otherwise?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Peter Chamor is equated to Bechor Adam;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that just like Bechor Adam cannot be redeemed until 30 days, and it must be redeemed for five Shekalim, the same applies to Peter Chamor. "Tifdeh" and "Tifdeh" teach that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi bar Yehudah):</span> The redemption must be at least one Shekel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In any case, this is difficult!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If R. Yosi equates Peter Chamor to Bechor Adam, he should require five Shekalim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he does not equate them, why does he require a Shekel?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Really, he does not equate them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"V'Chol Erkecha Yihyeh b'Shekel ha'Kodesh" teaches that every Erech (for our purposes, redemption) must be at least one Shekel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim disagree. They say that the verse teaches about Heseg Yad. (If a poor person pledged to give an Erech and cannot afford it, he pays what he can afford, but it must be at least one Shekel.)</p></div>
