<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven's wife gave birth for the first time and had two boys (we do not know which was born first), he must give five Shekalim to a Kohen;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one of them died within 30 days, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If the father died and the children are alive --</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir says, if they paid (from the estate) before dividing it, they paid (the Kohen need not return the money);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they divided the estate before paying it, they are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah says, there is a lien on the estate (they must pay).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If she gave birth to a boy and girl, the Kohen does not receive anything. (Perhaps the girl was born first).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Gemara) Question:</span> When did the father die?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He died after 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, (then the father was obligated to pay, and) R. Meir would not exempt if they divided before paying. He would agree that there is a lien on the estate!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He died within 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, after dividing they are exempt because each can say "I am exempt (I am not the Bechor)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also before dividing they can say this (for the father was never obligated)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> (Normally, if two people in a city are both named Yosef ben Shimon, a creditor cannot force either of them to pay a document unless he can prove which of them borrowed.) Our Mishnah teaches that if the two Yosefs bought a field together, a creditor can collect from (up to half of) it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He tells each "if you owe me, I collect your debt. If not, your partner owes me. I take his share."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> One's property is like an Arev (guarantor) for his debts;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one has no claim against the borrower, he cannot collect from the Arev!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven lent to Levi and Yehudah was an Arev, Reuven may not collect from Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Halachah is, he may not collect from Yehudah before claiming from Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (e) - Rava):</span> Really, he died after 30 days;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the estate was at least 10 Shekalim, all agree that they must pay. The case is, the estate has only five Shekalim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Both Tana'im hold like Rav Asi, who considers brothers (who divide an estate) to be half-heirs and half-buyers (he is unsure whether they are like heirs or like buyers).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>All agree that an obligation (Tosfos - that exists only because it is) written in the Torah is considered like a Milveh Al Peh (without a document);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">48b----------------------------------------48b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Both hold like Rav Papa, who says that a Milveh Al Peh is collected from heirs, but not from buyers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>They argue about whether partial Pidyon must be done when there is not five Shekalim for a full Pidyon (only the inherited half of the money is Meshu'abad to pay for it);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Meir expounds "Chamesh", but not half of Chamesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yehudah holds that Chamesh, or even half of Chamesh, is given.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If so, why does R. Yehudah say "there is a lien on the estate"? He should say "the father was obligated!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If brothers (it is not known which is the Bechor) divided an inheritance, if there are 10 Zuz (i.e., two and a half Shekalim) for each of them, they are obligated to give five Shekalim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there are less than 10 Zuz for each, they are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of "if there are 10 Zuz for each"?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It means that each brother received 10 Zuz, including the part considered inheritance and the part considered a sale. R. Yehudah holds that Chamesh or even half of Chamesh is given.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, even if there are less than 10 Zuz, they should be obligated!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, each brother received 10 Zuz inheritance. All hold that the full Chamesh must be given;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They argue about Rav Asi's law or Rav Papa's law.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOUBTFUL OBLIGATIONS TO REDEEM (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Seifa - R. Yehudah):</span> There is a lien on the estate.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When did the father die?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He died after 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, R. Meir would not exempt if they divided. He would agree that the estate is Meshu'abad!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He died within 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they divided, why does R. Yehudah obligate? Each can say "I am exempt"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> From our Mishnah we infer the following Halachah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one Yosef ben Shimon bought a field from the other, a creditor can collect (his entire debt) from it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He tells him "if you owe me, I collect your debt. If not, the land was Meshu'abad to me before you bought it." (Here also, the Kohen tells each son 'if you do not owe me, you received land from someone who owes me.')</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> One's property is like an Arev for his debts. If one has no claim against the borrower, he cannot collect from the Arev!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(In all of the following cases, the babies became mixed up at birth, and we never knew which was born to which mother.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If each of Reuven's two wives gave birth for the first time, to a boy, Reuven must give 10 Shekalim to Kohanim;</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he (already) gave 10 Shekalim to one Kohen, the Kohen must return five;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he gave five Shekalim to one Kohen and five to another (and did not specify which is for which son), each keeps the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If his two wives gave birth to a boy and a girl, or to two boys and a girl, he must give five Shekalim to a Kohen (at least one boy is a Bechor);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If they gave birth to a boy and two girls, or to two boys and two girls, the Kohen does not receive anything. (Perhaps the boy (or each boy) followed a girl.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If one (but not both) of his wives had given birth previously:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If both gave birth to boys, he must give five Shekalim;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If Reuven's wife and Shimon's wife both gave birth for the first time, to a boy, each gives five Shekalim to a Kohen;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If one of the babies died within 30 days --</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they gave to the same Kohen, he must return five Shekalim;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If they gave birth to a boy and a girl, Reuven and Shimon are exempt. The boy must redeem himself (when he grows up).</p>
