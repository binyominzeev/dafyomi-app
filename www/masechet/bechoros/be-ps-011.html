<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE MINIMAL REDEMPTION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the minimal value (according to Chachamim)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Even a lean Seh worth a Danka (a sixth of a Dinar) may be given.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious. The Mishnah permits a big or small Seh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that it cannot be so cheap, or lean. Rav Yosef teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Yehudah Nesi'ah had a Peter Chamor. He asked R. Tarfon how much the Seh used to redeem it must be worth.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Tarfon:</span> A generous person should give (a Seh worth at least) a Sela. A stingy person should give a (standard) Shekel (half a Sela). An average person should give Rigya (this will be explained).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah is, one should give Rigya.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much is Rigya?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "RiGya" is three Zuz. "RaGil" (is close) to a Sela (four Zuz) and to a Shekel (two Zuz).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Above, Rav Nachman ruled that the Halachah follows Chachamim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> If someone asks how much the Seh should be worth, we tell him Rigya;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If someone did not ask and gives a Seh worth a Danka, we do not tell him to give more.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> If one has a Peter Chamor and does not have a Seh to redeem it, he redeems it for its worth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to which Tana is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is not like R. Yehudah. He says that the Torah requires redeeming with a Seh! (This is unlike the conclusion on Daf 9b.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Acha):</span> It is like R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Ravina):</span> R. Yitzchak should teach according to Halachah. Surely, he would not rule like R. Shimon!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The general rule is, when R. Yehudah and R. Shimon argue, the Halachah follows R. Yehudah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Also, our Stam (anonymous) Mishnah is like R. Yehudah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> R. Yitzchak's teaching is even like R. Yehudah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Surely, Peter Chamor is not more stringent than Hekdesh, which may be redeemed for its value (using money or other Metaltelim)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Redemption with a Seh is not a stringency, rather, a leniency. It need not be worth as much as the Peter Chamor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>Rav Nachman brei d'Rav Yosef redeemed a Peter Chamor for cooked herbs of the same value.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHO OWNS A PETER CHAMOR BEFORE REDEMPTION?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shizbi):</span> If Reuven redeems Shimon's Peter Chamor, it is redeemed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who keeps the donkey, Reuven or Shimon?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We do not ask according to R. Shimon. Since it was not Asur b'Hana'ah, it always belonged to Shimon! (Reuven merely paid an obligation incumbent on Shimon.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We ask according to R. Yehudah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Since it was Asur b'Hana'ah before redemption, it is like Hekdesh. V'Nasan ha'Kesef v'Kam Lo teaches that whoever redeems Hekdesh receives it;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Or, since Shimon owned the net value (the donkey's value less the cost of a Seh to redeem it), it is like Shimon's!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman - Beraisa):</span> If Levi stole Shimon's Peter Chamor, he pays Kefel (double, like a regular thief) to Shimon;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even though Shimon does not own it now, he will own it later.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It is not R. Shimon. He permits benefit from it. Even now, Shimon owns it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Yehudah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We do not consider it like Hekdesh. If it were, Levi would not pay Kefel - "v'Gunav mi'Beis ha'Ish," but not if it was stolen from Hekdesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Rather, it is considered Shimon's donkey. (Therefore, if Reuven redeemed it, Shimon keeps it.) This proof cannot be challenged.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MATANOS THAT MUST BE DESIGNATED BUT NEED NOT BE GIVEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>If only one mother was Mevakeres... (The Seh enters the pen for Ma'aser... )</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the case of taking Ma'aser on the Seiyin?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It cannot be after they were given to a Kohen. A Mishnah exempts (from Ma'aser) animals bought or received for a gift!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, a Yisrael had 10 doubtful Pitrei Chamorim, He designates 10 Seiyin and keeps them, he takes Ma'aser from them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>This supports Rav Nachman;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If a Yisrael had 10 doubtful Pitrei Chamorim, he designates 10 Seiyin and keeps them. He takes Ma'aser from them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If a Yisrael inherited 10 definite Pitrei Chamorim from (his grandfather,) a Kohen, who had inherited them from (his grandfather,) a Yisrael, he designates 10 Seiyin and keeps them. He takes Ma'aser from them. (We consider it as if his grandfather designated them, and (because he is a Kohen) was entitled to keep them himself.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If a Yisrael inherited Tevel (untithed produce) after Miru'ach (final processing) from a Kohen, who had inherited it from a Yisrael, he separates Ma'aseros and keeps them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>He needed to teach both cases ((e) and (f));</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had he taught only (e), one might have thought that he keeps the Seiyin because they are distinct (need not be separated) from the Pitrei Chamorim, but we do not consider (Ma'aser or other) Matanos (that must be given to Kohanim, Leviyim or the poor) that have not yet been separated as if they were separated. (Since they never belonged to his grandfather, the Yisrael does not inherit them. He must give them away.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had he taught only (f), one might have thought that he keeps the Ma'aseros because they can be separated from the Tevel itself, but the Seh (or money) for the redemption is distinct from the Peter Chamor, so it is not considered to have been designated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Noson):</span> If one buys Tevel from a Nochri after Miru'ach, he separates Ma'aseros and keeps them.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who did Miru'ach?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Nochri did Miru'ach, it is exempt from Ma'aser. The Torah obligates tithing "Deganecha (your grain)." We read this "Diguncha", i.e. your (a Yisrael's) Miru'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Yisrael did Miru'ach while the produce belonged to the Nochri (Tosfos; Rashi - the Yisrael was the Nochri's sharecropper);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He must Ma'aser them, for Ein Kinyan l'Nochri. Even if a Nochri buys land in Eretz Yisrael, it retains its Kedushah, and the produce must be tithed mid'Oraisa;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He keeps the tithes, for a Kohen could not have forced them to be given (they are due to the Yisrael, who bought from the Nochri).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one deposits food with a Kusi or Am ha'Aretz (one who is suspected of not tithing properly or keeping laws of Shemitah), when he takes back the food, it retains its status regarding Ma'aser and Shemitah (we are not concerned lest the Shomer switched it with his own food. Often, the Gemara calls Nochrim "Kusim". Here, Kusim is meant literally, the people whom Sancheriv settled in place of the ten exiled Shevatim. They converted, but did not keep all the Mitzvos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one deposits with a Nochri, when he takes back the food he treats it like the Nochri's food. (We are concerned lest he switched it);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says, it is considered Demai (doubtfully tithed).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> All agree that he must tithe the food. They argue about whether he must give to the Kohen (for free):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Tana assumes that the Nochri surely switched it. Tithes are given (for free), like from definite Tevel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon considers it like Demai.<i> </i>(<i>Perhaps</i> he switched it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> They argue because we are unsure whether he switched it. If we knew that he surely switched it, all would agree that it is given to Kohanim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shmuel bar Noson taught that if one buys from a Nochri Tevel after Miru'ach, he separates Ma'aseros and keeps them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> Perhaps R. Shmuel discusses Terumah Gedolah, and the Tana'im discuss Terumas Ma'aser!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Abaye):</span> (Yes,) you reminded me of R. Yehoshua ben Levi's teaching!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi) Question:</span> What is the source that if one buys Tevel after Miru'ach from a Nochri, he is exempt from giving Terumas Ma'aser?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'El ha'Leviyim Tedaber... Ki Sikchu me'Es Bnei Yisrael" teaches that Terumas Ma'aser must be (separated and) given to Kohanim from Ma'aser that Leviyim receive from Yisrael;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If Leviyim buy Tevel from Nochrim (R. Tam - if Nochrim decide to separate Ma'aser and give to Leviyim), (they must separate Terumas Ma'aser but) they need not give Terumas Ma'aser to Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHEN THE SEH BELONGS TO KOHANIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Seh dies, one may benefit from it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where was it when it died?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was already given to a Kohen, this is obvious. It is the Kohen's property!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the original owner still had it, the Mishnah teaches that it is given to a Kohen. He may benefit from it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also this is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that before the Kohen receives it, it does not yet belong to him. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. Once it is designated, it belongs to Kohanim.</p></div>
