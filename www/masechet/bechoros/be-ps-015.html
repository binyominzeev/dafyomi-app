<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LIKE WHOM IS OUR MISHNAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (We did not answer that the Chachamim in that Mishnah argue with R. Shimon about a Ba'al Mum me'Ikara.) We assume that Chachamim agree that it may be redeemed if it died. If so, Rav should have said that our Mishnah is like R. Shimon and his opponent (the Chachamim who argue with him)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav holds like Reish Lakish, who says that Chachamim require Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah for Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis, but not for Kodshei Mizbe'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Our Mishnah cannot be Chachamim due to the Seifa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If it (a Ba'al Mum me'Ikara) died, it is buried.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the reason they are buried is not because Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah is impossible, rather, because we do not redeem Kodshim in order to feed them to dogs!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, they should have taught (a bigger Chidush,) that if an animal became Terefah, it must be buried.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rav holds like R. Yochanan (who says that Chachamim require Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah for Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis <i>and</i> Kodshei Mizbe'ach);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Indeed, the correct text of Rav's teaching should say 'our Mishnah is like R. Shimon and his opponent.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PESULEI HA'MUKDASHIM ARE LIKE TZVI VA'AYAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was Makdish an animal (and later it became a Ba'al Mum... )</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> (One eats Pesulei ha'Mukdashim like a) "Tzvi". Just like a deer is exempt from Bechorah, also Pesulei ha'Mukdashim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is exempt from Bechorah, but not from Matanos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ayal" - just like a wild goat is exempt from Bechorah and Matanos, also Pesulei ha'Mukdashim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should permit Chelev of Pesulei ha'Mukdashim, just like that of Tzvi and Ayal (they are Chayos)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ach" (Devarim 12:22) limits (the similarity to Tzvi and Ayal).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa suggested that Pesulei ha'Mukdashim would be exempt from Bechorah, but not from Matanos. Why would we distinguish them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable to exempt from Bechorah, for it does not apply to all animals (i.e. females), but Matanos apply to all animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> We should say that Oso v'Es Beno does not apply to Pesulei ha'Mukdashim, just like it does not apply to Tzvi and Ayal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Whether you consider Pesulei ha'Mukdashim like Chulin or like Kodshim, Oso v'Es Beno applies!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If so, why is a verse needed to forbid the Chelev? Whether we consider Pesulei ha'Mukdashim like Chulin or like Kodshim, the Chelev is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Just like "Ach" teaches that we do not equate Pesulei ha'Mukdashim to Tzvi va'Ayal regarding Chelev, it also teaches not to equate them regarding Oso v'Es Beno.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> "Ach" teaches only about Oso v'Es Beno. A different verse forbids Chelev;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does "Rak Es Damo Lo Sochel" refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It forbids the blood.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There is no need to forbid blood. Also the blood of Tzvi va'Ayal is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to Chelev.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse should explicitly say Chelev!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said Chelev, one might have thought that we learn from both the verse and the Hekesh (to Tzvi va'Ayal);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Hekesh would exempt from Kares, for Kares is only for Chelev Behemah, but Pesulei ha'Mukdashim are equated to Chayos;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The verse would teach that there is a Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Therefore, the Torah says "Dam" instead, to teach that there is Kares, just like for blood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tana says that "Ach" forbids Chelev. This is unlike Rava (who says that it teaches about Oso v'Es Beno)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana teaches that had we not had the verse "Rak Es Damo... " (to forbid the Chelev), we would have learned this from "Ach";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since it says also "Rak Es Damo... ," "Ach" teaches about Oso v'Es Beno.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PESULEI HA'MUKDASHIM ARE TO BE EATEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It does not become Chulin...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Tizbach" teaches that (you may slaughter Pesulei ha'Mukdashim, but) you may not shear them. "(You may eat the) Vasar" (meat, but) not the milk. "V'Achalta" -- (you may eat it), but not for your dogs;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is the source that we do not redeem Kodshim in order to feed them to dogs.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">15b----------------------------------------15b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Tizbach v'Achalta" - you may eat only after Shechitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This version permits redeeming Kodshim in order to feed them to dogs.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>OFFSPRING OF PESULEI HA'MUKDASHIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Its offspring and milk are forbidden after it is redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the mother became pregnant and gave birth after redemption, the child would be fully Chulin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The mother became pregnant before redemption and gave birth after redemption.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had the mother given birth before redemption, the child would be Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> (Had the Torah not specified, we would have assumed that a Shelamim can be male or female. Therefore, "Zachar" and "Nekevah" (in Vayikra 3:1) are extra, to be expounded.) "Zachar" includes Vlad Shelamim. "Nekevah" includes Temuras Shelamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This includes only the child and Temurah of a Tam. What is the source for a child and Temurah of a Ba'al Mum?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Im Zachar" includes Vlad Ba'al Mum. "Im Nekevah" includes Temuras Ba'al Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the law of offspring born after redemption?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Amora'im argue about a child born before redemption. One opinion says that it is offered. The other opinion requires Re'iyah (it grazes until it gets a Mum. It is redeemed, and the money goes for Nedavah (voluntary Olos of the Tzibur).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> We lock it up and leave it to starve, for there is no other solution:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot be offered, for it comes from a Kedushah Dechuyah. (Its mother was Nir'eh v'Nidcheh, i.e. it was Kosher to be offered, and then disqualified);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It cannot be redeemed, for it does not have the Kedushah needed to be Matpis Pidyono (to be Mekadesh the redemption money).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chanina):</span> Shortly before they are redeemed, we are Matpis (Makdish) the fetus with the same Kedushah (as its mother, e.g. Shelamim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> "Before <i>they</i> are redeemed" implies that also the child can be redeemed! (Rav Huna taught that it lacks the Kedushah needed to be Matpis Pidyono.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, shortly before the mother is redeemed, we are Matpis the fetus with the same Kedushah. (After it is born, it is Ro'eh. When it gets a Mum, it is redeemed, and a new Korban is brought.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question:</span> What is the reason (why Rav Huna does not allow R. Chanina's solution)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Levi):</span> This is a decree, lest one delay redeeming (and eating) the mother, in order to raise flocks. (Perhaps he will come to eat the mother before redemption.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question:</span> Why are Chachamim so stringent about the offspring (that one must let them die, or be Matpis them)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Levi):</span> This is a decree, lest one leave the offspring around to raise flocks. (Perhaps someone will eat them. This is forbidden, for they have Kedushah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Version #3 - Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah forbid the offspring after redemption?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Levi):</span> This is a decree, lest one delay eating the mother, in order to raise flocks. (One may come to shear or work with the mother.)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> May one be Matpis the fetus with Kedushah of a different Korban?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> One may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "bi'Sh'arecha-bi'Sh'arecha" from Bechor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may not be Matpis a Bechor (after it was born) with a different Kedushah - "Ach Bechor Asher Yevukar... Lo Yakdish Ish Oso." The same applies to Vlados Pesulei ha'Mukdashim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Answer (b) - Beraisa):</span> If one was Makdish a Ba'al Mum Kavu'a, and it was redeemed, Bechorah and Matanos apply to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The following laws apply both before and after Pidyon:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One who shears it or works with it is not lashed;</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Its offspring (born before Pidyon) may be redeemed Tam (without a Mum), one may Matfis them for any Korban;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The general rule is, it is Chulin in every way, there is just a Mitzvah (R. Gershom - stringency) to "redeem" it (to be Makdish money equal to its value for the same Korban).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>If one was Makdish a Tam or a Ba'al Mum Over, and later a Mum Kavu'a developed:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>After it is redeemed, it is exempt from Bechorah and Matanos;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Both before and after Pidyon, one who shears it or works with it is lashed, and it makes Temurah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Me'ilah applies before Pidyon, but not after Pidyon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>(If it became pregnant before Pidyon,) its offspring (even if born after Pidyon) are Kodesh. They may not be redeemed Tam. One may not be Matfis them for another Korban;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The general rule is, it is Kodesh in every way. The only Heter to people is to eat it (after redemption).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "the general rule" in the Reisha?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that one who slaughters it outside (the Mikdash) is exempt.</p>
