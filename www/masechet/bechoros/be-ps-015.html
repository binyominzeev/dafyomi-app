<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>LIKE WHOM IS OUR MISHNAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (We did not answer that the Chachamim in that Mishnah argue with R. Shimon about a Ba'al Mum me'Ikara.) We assume that Chachamim agree that it may be redeemed if it died. If so, Rav should have said that our Mishnah is like R. Shimon and his opponent (the Chachamim who argue with him)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav holds like Reish Lakish, who says that Chachamim require Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah for Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis, but not for Kodshei Mizbe'ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Our Mishnah cannot be Chachamim due to the Seifa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If it (a Ba'al Mum me'Ikara) died, it is buried.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the reason they are buried is not because Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah is impossible, rather, because we do not redeem Kodshim in order to feed them to dogs!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, they should have taught (a bigger Chidush,) that if an animal became Terefah, it must be buried.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rav holds like R. Yochanan (who says that Chachamim require Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah for Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis <i>and</i> Kodshei Mizbe'ach);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Indeed, the correct text of Rav's teaching should say 'our Mishnah is like R. Shimon and his opponent.'</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PESULEI HA'MUKDASHIM ARE LIKE TZVI VA'AYAL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was Makdish an animal (and later it became a Ba'al Mum... )</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> (One eats Pesulei ha'Mukdashim like a) "Tzvi". Just like a deer is exempt from Bechorah, also Pesulei ha'Mukdashim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is exempt from Bechorah, but not from Matanos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ayal" - just like a wild goat is exempt from Bechorah and Matanos, also Pesulei ha'Mukdashim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should permit Chelev of Pesulei ha'Mukdashim, just like that of Tzvi and Ayal (they are Chayos)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ach" (Devarim 12:22) limits (the similarity to Tzvi and Ayal).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa suggested that Pesulei ha'Mukdashim would be exempt from Bechorah, but not from Matanos. Why would we distinguish them?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable to exempt from Bechorah, for it does not apply to all animals (i.e. females), but Matanos apply to all animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> We should say that Oso v'Es Beno does not apply to Pesulei ha'Mukdashim, just like it does not apply to Tzvi and Ayal!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Whether you consider Pesulei ha'Mukdashim like Chulin or like Kodshim, Oso v'Es Beno applies!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If so, why is a verse needed to forbid the Chelev? Whether we consider Pesulei ha'Mukdashim like Chulin or like Kodshim, the Chelev is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Just like "Ach" teaches that we do not equate Pesulei ha'Mukdashim to Tzvi va'Ayal regarding Chelev, it also teaches not to equate them regarding Oso v'Es Beno.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> "Ach" teaches only about Oso v'Es Beno. A different verse forbids Chelev;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does "Rak Es Damo Lo Sochel" refer to?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It forbids the blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There is no need to forbid blood. Also the blood of Tzvi va'Ayal is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to Chelev.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse should explicitly say Chelev!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said Chelev, one might have thought that we learn from both the verse and the Hekesh (to Tzvi va'Ayal);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Hekesh would exempt from Kares, for Kares is only for Chelev Behemah, but Pesulei ha'Mukdashim are equated to Chayos;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The verse would teach that there is a Lav.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>Therefore, the Torah says "Dam" instead, to teach that there is Kares, just like for blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tana says that "Ach" forbids Chelev. This is unlike Rava (who says that it teaches about Oso v'Es Beno)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana teaches that had we not had the verse "Rak Es Damo... " (to forbid the Chelev), we would have learned this from "Ach";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since it says also "Rak Es Damo... ," "Ach" teaches about Oso v'Es Beno.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Tizbach" teaches that (you may slaughter Pesulei ha'Mukdashim, but) you may not shear them.

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Its offspring and milk are forbidden after it is redeemed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the mother became pregnant and gave birth after redemption, the child would be fully Chulin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The mother became pregnant before redemption and gave birth after redemption.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had the mother given birth before redemption, the child would be Kodesh.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> (Had the Torah not specified, we would have assumed that a Shelamim can be male or female. Therefore, "Zachar" and "Nekevah" (in Vayikra 3:1) are extra, to be expounded.) "Zachar" includes Vlad Shelamim. "Nekevah" includes Temuras Shelamim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This includes only the child and Temurah of a Tam. What is the source for a child and Temurah of a Ba'al Mum?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Im Zachar" includes Vlad Ba'al Mum. "Im Nekevah" includes Temuras Ba'al Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the law of offspring born after redemption?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Amora'im argue about a child born before redemption. One opinion says that it is offered. The other opinion requires Re'iyah (it grazes until it gets a Mum. It is redeemed, and the money goes for Nedavah (voluntary Olos of the Tzibur).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> We lock it up and leave it to starve, for there is no other solution:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It cannot be offered, for it comes from a Kedushah Dechuyah. (Its mother was Nir'eh v'Nidcheh, i.e. it was Kosher to be offered, and then disqualified);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It cannot be redeemed, for it does not have the Kedushah needed to be Matpis Pidyono (to be Mekadesh the redemption money).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chanina):</span> Shortly before they are redeemed, we are Matpis (Makdish) the fetus with the same Kedushah (as its mother, e.g. Shelamim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> "Before <i>they</i> are redeemed" implies that also the child can be redeemed! (Rav Huna taught that it lacks the Kedushah needed to be Matpis Pidyono.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, shortly before the mother is redeemed, we are Matpis the fetus with the same Kedushah. (After it is born, it is Ro'eh. When it gets a Mum, it is redeemed, and a new Korban is brought.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question:</span> What is the reason (why Rav Huna does not allow R. Chanina's solution)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Levi):</span> This is a decree, lest one delay redeeming (and eating) the mother, in order to raise flocks. (Perhaps he will come to eat the mother before redemption.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question:</span> Why are Chachamim so stringent about the offspring (that one must let them die, or be Matpis them)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Levi):</span> This is a decree, lest one leave the offspring around to raise flocks. (Perhaps someone will eat them. This is forbidden, for they have Kedushah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #3 - Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah forbid the offspring after redemption?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Levi):</span> This is a decree, lest one delay eating the mother, in order to raise flocks. (One may come to shear or work with the mother.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "bi'Sh'arecha-bi'Sh'arecha" from Bechor;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One may not be Matpis a Bechor (after it was born) with a different Kedushah - "Ach Bechor Asher Yevukar... Lo Yakdish Ish Oso." The same applies to Vlados Pesulei ha'Mukdashim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Answer (b) - Beraisa):</span> If one was Makdish a Ba'al Mum Kavu'a, and it was redeemed, Bechorah and Matanos apply to it.</p></div>
