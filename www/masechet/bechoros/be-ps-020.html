<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE OPINION OF R. YISHMAEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Defense (of Answer #2 - Ravina):</span> He can hold like Chachamim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim follow a majority that does not depend on an act occurring (such as judges' opinions or stores), they do not follow a majority that depends on an action (an animal must breed to become pregnant and bear a child).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> If a goat gave birth in its first year, the kid is Vadai (a definite Bechor). It is given to a Kohen. If it gave birth after this, it is a Safek;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a sheep gave birth within two years, the lamb is Vadai, it is given to a Kohen; if it gave birth after this, it is a Safek;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If a cow gave birth within three years, the calf is Vadai, it is given to a Kohen; if it gave birth after this, it is a Safek;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>A donkey is like a cow;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yosi says the cutoff age for a donkey (for a Vadai Bechor) is four years.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> R. Yishmael erred!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Halachah were that only a proper child exempts from Bechorah, he would be right;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, Chachamim taught that the following are Simanim of a child - Tinuf in a small animal, a Shilya in a large animal, and a Shapir or Shilya in a woman.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>I disagree with them (this will be explained). Rather, if a six month goat had Tinuf, it can give birth in its first year. If a yearling sheep had Tinuf, it can give birth in its second year.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Akiva says I argue with this. Rather, if we know that an animal previously gave birth, the Kohen does not receive anything;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If we know that it did not give birth before, the Bechor belongs to the Kohen;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If we do not know whether it gave birth before, the owner eats it when it gets a Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do R. Yishmael and (Chachamim according to) R. Yehoshua argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue about whether Tinuf exempts from Bechorah. R. Yehoshua says that it does, and R. Yishmael says that it does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, all agree that Tinuf exempts from Bechorah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, they argue about whether we are concerned for Tinuf if we did not see it. R. Yehoshua is concerned, R. Yishmael is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, R. Yishmael is concerned. Rava concluded that R. Yishmael holds like R. Meir, who is concerned for the minority!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He is concerned for the minority only to be stringent. (If one buys a goat from a Nochri after one year, he is concerned lest it is from the minority that do not gave birth within a year. Its first child is a Safek Bechor. One may not shear it, work with it, or eat it before it gets a Mum);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He is not concerned for the minority to be lenient. (If a Yisrael bought a goat from a Nochri and it gave birth to a kid in the first year, it is a Vadai Bechor. He gives it to a Kohen. We do not consider it a Safek (perhaps Tinuf preceded it) to let the Yisrael keep it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He is concerned for the minority, whether it is a stringency or a leniency. The Beraisa discusses a goat that was Metanef and later gave birth in the first year:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yishmael says that if it was true Tinuf, it could not give birth in the first year. (Therefore, surely it was not proper Tinuf);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehoshua says that it can Metanef and give birth within the first year.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehoshua):</span> I disagree with them. Rather, if a six month goat had Tinuf, it can gave birth in its first year. If a yearling sheep had Tinuf, it can gave birth in its second year.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between R. Yehoshua's own opinion and what he said in the name of Chachamim (that Tinuf is a sign of a child)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, a goat was Metanef after six (full) months. They argue about Ze'iri's law:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ze'iri):</span> An animal will not become pregnant (Rashi - mate) less than 30 days after Tinuf (or a proper birth).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim hold like Ze'iri. (Therefore, such a goat will not become pregnant within seven months, so it cannot give birth within the year, for the gestation of goats is five months.) R. Yehoshua argues with Ze'iri. (It can become pregnant within seven months, and give birth within the year.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> All agree to Ze'iri's law. They argue about whether the (five) months of pregnancy must be complete;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">20b----------------------------------------20b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim hold that the months must be complete (therefore, since it cannot become pregnant within seven months, it cannot give birth within the year), R. Yehoshua holds that the months need not be complete.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> All agree (with Ze'iri's law and) that the months of pregnancy must be complete. They argue about whether part of a day counts like an entire day;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehoshua counts it like an entire day. Therefore, if it was Metanef on the first day of the seventh month, it could become pregnant 29 days later, and give birth within the year;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim do not count it like an entire day. (It cannot become pregnant until 30 days later, i.e. the eighth month, so it cannot give birth within the year.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ARE WE CONCERNED FOR THE MINORITY?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> I disagree. Rather, if we know...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between R. Yehoshua and R. Akiva?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina of Sura):</span> They argue about whether milk exempts from Bechorah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva alludes to another way of knowing that an animal is exempt from Bechorah, i.e. if it has milk. Most animals do not have milk before giving birth;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehoshua is concerned for the minority of animals that have milk before giving birth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Elsewhere,) R. Yehoshua is not concerned for the minority!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (Reuven and his wife Leah went overseas.) If Reuven died (without any known children or brothers), Leah need not be concerned (lest his mother gave birth to a boy before Reuven died, which would obligate Leah to wait to do Yibum or Chalitzah. Rather, she may remarry.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If his mother was pregnant when they left, Leah must be concerned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehoshua says, she need not be concerned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Half of all babies born are females. A minority of pregnant women miscarry;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>When we combine the half that are females with the minority of miscarriages, we find that a minority of pregnant women give birth to males. R. Yehoshua is not concerned for the minority. (Sometimes twins of both genders are born, so more than half of all live births include at least one male. We must say that miscarriages are more common than mixed twins. This is even if she is already in the ninth month, for R. Yehoshua permits in all cases. Perhaps we consider only  the entire category of pregnant women (the majority do not give birth to males), and do not distinguish stages of pregnancy. If R. Yehoshua accepted the opinion of R. Akiva (Yevamos 79b), that Yibum and Chalitzah do not apply to a Seris Chamah (a male who will not develop like a normal male), it suffices to say that miscarriages and Serisim together are more common than mixed twins.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The opinions in our Beraisa must be switched.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Yehoshua):</span> Having milk exempts from Bechorah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva says, it does not exempt.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>BIRTHS WITHIN ONE YEAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a goat gave birth to three females, and each of those gave birth to three females, all of them (except for the grandmother - Rashi's preferred explanation) enter the pen together for Ma'aser (i.e. if all were born in the same year. The Tana teaches that this is possible);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Shimon says, I witnessed such a case (with a goat). Ma'aser was taken within the year.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the (first) Tana say that all three daughters gave birth to three females? Even if only one of them gave birth to three, and the other two give birth to two each, this would comprise 10 (for Ma'aser)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he must say that one of the daughters gave birth to three, (for brevity or parallel structure) he says that all of them gave birth to three.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must he say that even one daughter gave birth to three? Each could give birth to two, and their mother could have another child at that same time!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Tana holds that an animal that was Metanef (or gave birth) cannot give birth again within the year.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. Even if an animal can give birth in the same year after Tinuf, it cannot give birth twice in one year.</p></div>
