<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ZIKAH OF THE BREAD AND LAMBS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> All agree that if the bread and lambs were Huzkeku (committed) to (be brought with) each other, they are Me'akev each other;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shechitah is Zokek.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael were unsure whether or not Tenufah is Zokek.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be able to answer this from R. Yochanan, who said that Shechitah is Zokek! (This implies that Tenufah, which is before Shechitah, is not Zokek.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is doubtful what R. Yochanan himself held;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Perhaps he was sure that Shechitah is Zokek, but Tenufah is not;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Or, perhaps he was sure that Shechitah is Zokek, but he was unsure about Tenufah. He said only the law he was sure about.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This question is not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yehudah ben Chanina):</span> "Kodesh Yihyu la'Shem la'Kohen" is written after Tenufah, yet Tana'im argue (about which one is not Me'akev the other. This shows that Tenufah is not Zokek!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> The verse is written after Shechitah (only then the lambs belong to the Kohen), yet they argue (even though Shechitah is Zokek)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that the verse refers to (the lambs or bread, whichever is Me'akev) before Shechitah, and says that they will be for the Kohen (after Shechitah);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Likewise, the verse refers to (whichever is Me'akev) before Tenufah, and says that they will be for the Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really true that Shechitah is Zokek?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If (some) loaves of Lachmei Todah became Chaser before Shechitah (of the Todah), new loaves are brought and the Todah is slaughtered. (It is fully Kosher);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If they became Chaser after Shechitah (but before Zerikah), Zerikah is done (l'Shem Shelamim), and the Todah is Kosher. Its meat is eaten, but the owner did not fulfill his vow (to bring a Todah). (All of) the bread is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If they were broken after Zerikah, (the Todah is fully Kosher, just) Terumah (the Kohen's portion, one loaf from each kind) must be taken from full loaves to exempt (all the others, including) the broken ones,</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If loaves left (Yerushalayim) before Shechitah, they are returned, and the Todah is slaughtered;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>If they left after Shechitah, Zerikah is done. The Todah is Kosher, the meat is eaten, the vow was not fulfilled, and the bread is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>If they left after Zerikah, Terumah must be taken from bread that did not leave to exempt (all the bread, including) the bread that left.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>If loaves became Teme'im before Shechitah, more loaves are brought, and the Todah is slaughtered;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>If they became Teme'im after Shechitah, Zerikah is done. The Todah is Kosher, the meat is eaten; the vow was fulfilled because the Tzitz is Meratzeh , but the bread is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>If they became Teme'im after Zerikah, Terumah must be taken from Tahor bread to exempt (all, including) the Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If Shechitah is Zokek, when loaves were broken (or left or Nitma'u) after Shechitah, also the Todah should become Pasul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Todah is different, for the Torah calls it 'Shelamim'. Just like Shelamim is brought without bread, Todah may be brought (l'Shem Shelamim) without bread.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> If Tenufah is Zokek:</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">46b----------------------------------------46b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If (after Tenufah) Shtei ha'Lechem were lost (or Nifsalim), the lambs are Nifsalim. If the lambs were lost, the bread is Nifsal;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Tenufah is not Zokek:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If (after Tenufah with the lambs) the bread was lost and new bread was brought, does it require Tenufah with the lambs?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>There is no question if the lambs were lost. Surely Tenufah is required (for they permit the bread);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Even when the bread was lost, there is no question according to Ben Nanas, who says that the lambs are primary. (Surely, another Tenufah is not required.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The question is according to R. Akiva, who says that the bread is primary;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Since the bread is primary, Tenufah is required;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Or, since the lambs permit the bread, no other Tenufah is required!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>This question is not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHAT IS MEKADESH THE BREAD?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> What is the difference between the two lambs, which are Mekadesh the bread and are Me'akev it, and the seven lambs, which are neither Mekadesh the bread nor Me'akev it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> The bread is waved (Tenufah) with the two lambs, but not with the seven.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Lachmei Todah are not waved with the Todah, yet the Todah is Mekadesh the bread and is Me'akev it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We learn from Todah. It is a Shelamim, and it is Mekadesh and Me'akev the bread. Likewise, only Shelamim (the two lambs) are Mekadesh and Me'akev the bread. (The seven lambs are Olos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from Lachmei Todah, for no other Korban accompanies them. Other Korbanos are brought with Shtei ha'Lechem. Perhaps all are Mekadesh it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> We learn from Lachmei Nazir. Three Korbanos accompany them, yet only the ram, which is a Shelamim, is Mekadesh the bread. Likewise, only the two lambs are Mekadesh Shtei ha'Lechem!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that only the ram is Mekadesh Lachmei Nazir?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "V'Es ha'Ayil Ya'aseh Zevach Shelamim la'Shem Al Sal ha'Matzos" teaches that the bread is a Chovah of the ram, and Shechitah of the ram is Mekadesh it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Therefore, if the ram was slaughtered Lo Lishmah, the bread is not Mekudash.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SHTEI HA'LECHEM WITHOUT THE LAMBS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Shtei ha'Lechem was brought by itself, we wait for Ibur Tzurah. (It is left overnight, and become Pasul due to Linah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In any case, this is difficult!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Shtei ha'Lechem brought by itself may be eaten, it should be eaten;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it must be burned, it should be burned right away, why must we wait for Ibur Tzurah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> Mid'Oraisa, it may be eaten. Chachamim decreed not to eat it, lest the next year the two lambs will be brought, and Kohanim will eat the bread before offering the lambs (because they recall that the previous year the bread did not need lambs to permit it. They will not realize that when the lambs are brought, the lambs permit it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rabah, for himself - Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If a Kohen is Shokel (gives a half-Shekel), he does not transgress;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Zakai:</span> Rather, a Kohen who is not Shokel transgresses!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Kohanim (incorrectly) expound the following, to their advantage;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"V'Chol Minchas Kohen Kalil Tihyeh Lo Se'achel"- if Kohanim would be Shokel, they would be (joint) owners of (all Korbanos Tzibur, including) the Omer, Lechem ha'Panim and Shtei ha'Lechem. If so, these could not be eaten!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of Shtei ha'Lechem?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it was brought with the two lambs, even if it belongs (also) to Kohanim it may be eaten, just like a Kohen who brings Lachmei Todah with a Todah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, it was brought without the lambs, and the Mishnah says that it may be eaten!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 to Question (3) - Abaye):</span> Really, it was brought with the lambs;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We cannot learn from Todah, for Lachmei Todah are not called 'Minchah' (therefore, "v'Chol Minchas Kohen..." does not apply to it), but Shtei ha'Lechem is called Minchah - "b'Hakrivchem Minchah Chadashah la'Shem."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (b) - Rav Yosef):</span> Really, it must be burned;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It may not be burned right away, because we do not burn Kodshim on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> That Halachah (we do not burn Kodshim on Yom Tov) refers to Kodshim that (b'Di'eved) became Pesulim. Shtei ha'Lechem brought by itself should be burned. This may be done on Yom Tov, like the burning of the bull and goat of Yom Kipur!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Yosef):</span> (It must be burned.) Chachamim decreed not to burn it right away, for perhaps lambs will be found later in the day. (After we offer them, the bread may be eaten.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Granted, they should not be burned as long as we could offer the two lambs (Rashi - until the afternoon Tamid; Tosfos - until night.) Why must we wait until Ibur Tzurah, i.e. morning?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Indeed, 'Ibur Tzurah' in the Mishnah refers to the lastest time to offer the lambs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Defense of Answer #1 (Rava):</span> Really, it may be eaten. Chachamim decreed, lest Kohanim err the next year when lambs will be brought;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like Rabah, but I (Rava) learn from a different source.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Mi'Moshvoseichem Tavi'u Lechem Tenufah" - just like Bikurim are brought by themselves, and are eaten, Shtei ha'Lechem may be brought by themselves, and are eaten.</p></div>
