<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>KNEADING OF HEKDESH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Kneading of Hekdesh exempts (from Chalah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Leah was Makdish dough, and before it was kneaded (i.e. it was still flour) she redeemed it, (when she later kneads it,) Chalah must be taken;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If she was Makdish a kneaded dough and redeemed it, Chalah must be taken;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If she was Makdish it before it was kneaded and the Gizbar (treasurer of Hekdesh) kneaded it (i.e. it was kneaded while it was Hekdesh), it is exempt from Chalah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Does kneading of a Nochri exempt?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Nochri kneaded a dough and later converted, it is exempt from Chalah. If it was kneaded after he converted, or if we are in doubt, Chalah must be taken.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Possibility #1:</span> There is no dissenting opinion. Even R. Meir and R. Yehudah, who obligate Miru'ach of a Nochri (regarding Ma'aser), exempt (from Chalah) a dough kneaded by a Nochri;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Regarding Ma'aser it says "Degancha" twice. (We expound each like 'Digunecha', i.e. your Miru'ach, not of a Nochri.) Two exclusions for the same matter always come to include it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Regarding Chalah it says "Arisoseichem" twice;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text):</span> One is expounded like 'Isaschem", Chalah applies to the Shi'ur of 'your dough' (in the Midbar, each day everyone received an Omer of Man, i.e. the volume of 43 and a fifth eggs);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> One excludes the dough of Hekdesh; (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>The other excludes the dough of a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Possibility #2:</span> The Mishnah is like R. Yosi and R. Shimon, who exempt Miru'ach of a Nochri, but R. Meir and R. Yehudah, who obligate Miru'ach Nochri, learn a Gezerah Shavah "Reishis-Reishis" from Ma'aser to obligate a dough kneaded by a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> May Hash-m show me the answer in a dream! (I will never be able to resolve my question.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava, at a later time):</span> Possibility #2 is correct. Whoever obligates Miru'ach of a Nochri, obligateds kneading of a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rav Papa - Beraisa):</span> (When Peter Chamor (a firstborn donkey) is born, one should give a Seh (goat or sheep) to a Kohen to redeem it. If not, we behead the donkey, and one may not benefit from it.) If a Nochri designated Peter Chamor (Tosfos -the donkey itself; Rashi - a Seh to redeem it) or Chalah, we inform him that he is exempt. Zarim may eat the Chalah. One may shear the Chamor (Rashi - Seh) and work with it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he designated Terumah, it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> The Tana obligates Miru'ach of a Nochri, but exempts kneading of a Nochri!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2 (Ravina - Beraisa):</span> If a Nochri took Chalah in Eretz Yisrael or Terumah in Chutz la'Aretz, we inform him that he is exempt. Zarim may eat the Chalah. The Terumah is not Medame'a. (I.e. if it becomes mixed with a larger amount of Chulin, the mixture is permitted.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> His Terumah in Eretz Yisrael is forbidden, and it is Medame'a!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> The Tana obligates Miru'ach of a Nochri, but exempts kneading of a Nochri!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> Miru'ach of a Nochri is exempt mid'Oraisa. It is liable mid'Rabanan. This is a decree due to rich people (lest they buy from a Nochri merchant who did Miru'ach himself, and people will think that also Peros bought from a Yisrael merchant is exempt. Alternatively, it is lest they give their produce to a Nochri to do Miru'ach, to exempt themselves from Ma'aser.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">67b----------------------------------------67b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should decree similarly about Chalah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One who wants to be exempt from Chalah can knead small doughs at most five Reva'im (the volume of 43 eggs. This is exempt from Chalah.) He need not use a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also one who wants to be exempt from Ma'aser can use R. Oshaya's method. He does not need a Nochri!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> One may scheme, and bring grain into his house with the chaff, and his animal (or himself, if he eats Arai (casually)) may eat without tithing.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Alternatively, he can enter the Peros into the house through the roof or Karfef (an enclosed place without a roof, and eat Arai or feed his animal without tithing).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> These methods are conspicuous. People are ashamed to use them. They would rather use a Nochri;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Kneading small doughs is inconspicuous. People not are ashamed to do this.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>REAPING BEFORE THE OMER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Oil and Levonah were put in the Kli (Rashi's text - before the Isaron of Soles). More oil was poured on, and (Tosfos - before pouring) Belilah (mixing the flour with oil) was done;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>They did Tenufah, Hagashah, Kemitzah and Haktarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Meir says, immediately, the markets of Yerushalayim were full of (Chodosh) flour and parched grain. Chachamim disapproved. (If people harvest before the Omer, perhaps they will eat Chodosh before the Omer);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R.Yehudah says, Chachamim approved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> R. Yehudah does not decree lest one eat something forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> We check (for Chametz) on the night of (that begins) Nisan 14, (and if Bedikah was not done then) on the morning of the 14th, and (if not,) at the time of Bi'ur (when Chametz must be destroyed, the sixth hour of the day (Rashi) or after noon (Tosfos Pesachim));</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> Chachamim say, if Bedikah was not done (during the Mo'ed, i.e. time of Bi'ur), it is done afterwards (during Pesach).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> Chachamim say, if Bedikah was not done (during the Mo'ed, i.e. festival), it is done after Pesach. (If one owned Chametz during Pesach, it is forbidden forever.)</p></div>
