<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yochanan taught that this is not true.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Questions (Reish Lakish):</span> Does this depend on whether the covering is nailed on? Does it depend on whether the rim is covered?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It does not matter whether the covering is nailed on, or whether the rim is covered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Perhaps the Shulchan is not Batel to its covering, for it is made of cedar wood, which is important!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Partial Rejection:</span> Granted, this answers for Reish Lakish, who says that only Kelim of cheap wood are Batel to their covering, but Kelim of expensive wood are not Batel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, it does not answer for R. Yochanan, who says that even Kelim of expensive wood are Batel!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The Shulchan is an exception, for the Torah calls it a Kli Etz (in spite of its covering):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "ha'Mizbe'ach Etz... Zeh ha'Shulchan Asher Lifnei Hash-m"? First it calls it Mizbe'ach, and then it calls it Shulchan!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan and R. Elazar):</span> When the Mikdash stood, the Mizbe'ach is Mechaper for people. Nowadays that there is no Mikdash, a man's table is Mechaper for him. (He feeds guests and the poor on it.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ARRANGING THE POLES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There were four golden Snifin...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Katina):</span> "V'Asisa Ke'arosav v'Chaposav u'Ksosav u'Menakiyosav" - Ka'arosav are the molds, Kaposav are the Bazichin, Kesosav are the Snifin, Menakiyosav are the poles;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Asher Yusach Bahen" - the poles cover the bread.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> Arrangement or removal of the poles is not Docheh Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Torah commands about (arranging the bread on) poles, it should be Docheh Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction (Rava):</span> I erred. (In this very Mishnah,) R. Akiva gives a general rule, that only what cannot be done before Shabbos is Docheh Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since the poles need not be arranged on Shabbos, this is not Docheh Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The bread is on poles lest it get moldy. The bread can be arranged on Shabbos without poles, and it will not get moldy in a half day (the poles can be inserted after Shabbos. Likewise, we can remove the poles from the old bread before Shabbos, and it will not get moldy before it is removed the next day.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> On Erev Shabbos the poles are removed from the breads. They are left along the length of the Shulchan. On Motzei Shabbos, he lifts the ends of each loaf and puts the poles underneath.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Each of the four middle loaves requires three poles underneath it. The top loaf needs only two, since nothing is on top of it. The bottom loaf does not need any poles, since it rests on the Shulchan.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE AMOS OF THE MIKDASH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Wherever the Torah refers to Amos in the Mikdash, they are medium Amos, except for the Amos of the golden (inner) Mizbe'ach, and the Keranos (top corners), Sovev (walkway around the Mizbe'ach) and Yesod (a protrusion from the base of the outer Mizbe'ach);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, all Amos of Binyan (things attached to the ground) are six Tefachim. All Amos of Kelim are five Tefachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Both of them expound the same verse, "v'Eleh Midos ha'Mizbe'ach..."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>("Amah Amah v'Tofach" refers to a (five Tefachim) Amah that needs an additional Tefach to be a medium Amah, it applies to all of the following;)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">97b----------------------------------------97b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"V'Chek ha'Amah" refers to the Yesod. "V'Amah Rochav" is the Sovev. "U'Gvulah El Sefasah Soviv Zeres ha'Echad" are the Keranos. "V'Zeh Gav ha'Mizbe'ach" is the inner Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir explains that only these are made according to a five Tefachim Amah. The Amah of all Kelim is six Tefachim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehudah explains that all Kelim are made according to a five Tefachim Amah, like these.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (We are thinking that all Amos from the Yesod until the Sovev are of five Tefachim.) What do we expound "v'Chek ha'Amah v'Amah Rochav"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> From Chek ha'Amah (the Yesod) until v'Amah Rochav (the Sovev), the Amos are of five Tefachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How tall is the Mizbe'ach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is 10 Amos. Six of the Amos (from the Yesod until the Sovev) are of five Tefachim. The other four are of six Tefachim. In all, the Mizbe'ach is 54 Tefachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Half the height is 27 Tefachim. Three Tefachim above this is the Sovev, for it is 24 Tefachim below the top.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Chut ha'Sikra girds the Mizbe'ach in the middle, to distinguish between (the place for) upper and lower blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (to Answer #1 - Beraisa):</span> To offer Olas ha'Of, the Kohen ascends the ramp, turns to the Sovev, and comes to the southeast corner;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Melikah is done Mul (in line with) the Oref. He fully cuts both Simanim, and presses the bird against the Mizbe'ach to squeeze out the blood;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he squeezed out the blood even an Amah below his legs (which are on the Sovev), it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If the Sovev is only three Tefachim above the Chut ha'Sikra, the Beraisa is Machshir two (or three) Tefachim below the Chut ha'Sikra. (Dam Olas ha'Of must be above!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, (all 10 Amos of the Mizbe'ach's height are of six Tefachim. The verse refers to five-Tefachim Amos of the Mizbe'ach's width.) Chek ha'Amah is the Yesod (it juts out one Amah), Amah Rochav is the Sovev, Gevulah El Sefasah Soviv is the Keranos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mizbe'ach is 10 Amos tall, each is six Tefachim. Half the height is 30 Tefachim; six Tefachim above this is the Sovev, for it is 24 Tefachim below the top.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If he squeezed out the blood even an Amah below his legs, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot say that all these Amos of the Mizbe'ach's width are five Tefachim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The (base of the) Mizbe'ach was 32 Amos by 32 Amos. The Yesod was one Amah tall. The Mizbe'ach was recessed one Amah (in each direction). The Mizbe'ach above the Yesod was 30 Amos square.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> (The outer Mizbe'ach was attached, so its (32) Amos are of six Tefachim, like R. Yehudah said in the Mishnah.) If the Yesod juts out an Amah of only five Tefachim, the Mizbe'ach above the Yesod was 30 Amos and two Tefachim square!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Above the Yesod, the Mizbe'ach rose five Amos until the Sovev, then it recessed one Amah. The Mizbe'ach above the Sovev was 28 Amos square.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If (also) the Amah of the Sovev is five Tefachim, the Mizbe'ach above the Sovev was 28 Amos and four Tefachim square!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion (to answer both questions):</span> Perhaps the Tana omits the extra Tefachim and only teaches the number of full Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This answer does not help for the next clause!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Each Keren was one Amah square. The Mizbe'ach within the Keranos was 26 Amos square.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> If all these Amos are of five Tefachim, the Mizbe'ach within the Keranos was 26 Amos and six Tefachim, i.e. 27 Amos square!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana did not bother to give the precise number of Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The walkway on top of the Mizbe'ach (within the Keranos) was one Amah in each direction. The Ma'arachah (the place of the fire) was 24 Amos square.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Question #4:</span> (Granted, the walkway was an Amah of six Tefachim. Still,) the Ma'arachah was 25 Amos square!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Here also, the Tana was not precise.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot say that the Navi was not precise!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "veha'Ari'el Shteim Esreh Orech bi'Shteim Esreh Rochav Ravu'a El Arba'as Reva'av" teaches that the Ma'arachah is only 12 Amos square!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "El Arba'as Reva'av" teaches that it is 12 in each direction emanating from the center, i.e. 24 Amos square!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps six of the 32 Amos of the Mizbe'ach are of five Tefachim (in all, it is 31 Amos of six Tefachim!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">15.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the calculation of the length of the Azarah is wrong!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">16.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Azarah was 187 Amos long by 135 Amos wide:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Its length, from east to west, was 11 Amos for Ezras Yisrael (where Yisre'elim often go), 11 Amos for Ezras Kohanim, 32 Amos for the Mizbe'ach, 22 Amos between the Mizbe'ach and the Ulam, 100 Amos for the Heichal (including the Ulam), and 11 Amos in back of the Heichal. It is 187 Amos in all.</p></div>
