<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question (R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> If any amount of oil was put on a k'Zayis of Minchah, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Must 'Simah' (of oil) resemble 'Nesinah' (of Levonah, which connotes a k'Zayis?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This question is not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Lo Yasim Aleha Shemen v'Lo Yiten" teaches that liability for both Lavim (on one Minchah) applies only when two different Kohanim put the oil and Levonah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Aleha" - the Lavim are based on (adding to) the Minchah itself (and not the one who puts. Therefore, even one Kohen can be liable twice.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Lo Yasim Aleha Shemen v'Lo Yiten" teaches that liability for both Lavim applies only when there are two Kohanim (i.e. Menachos. Normally, a different Kohen offers each Minchah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Aleha" - both Lavim apply to even one Minchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #3 - R. Tam - (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Lo Yasim..." teaches that liability for both Lavim is when two Kohanim (or one) put(s) oil and Levonah one after the other!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Aleha" - the Lavim are for putting on the Minchah itself (like it should be, without oil or Levonah. Alternatively, they are for putting on a valid Minchah. After the first was put, it is Pasul.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HAGASHAH AND TENUFAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Some Menachos require Hagashah, but not Tenufah. Some require Hagashah and Tenufah. Some require Tenufah, but not Hagashah. Some do not require either.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The following require Hagashah but not Tenufah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Minchas Soles, Machavas, Marcheshes, Chalos, Rekikim, Minchas Kohanim, Chavitim, the Minchah of Nochrim or women, and Minchas Chotei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says, Minchas Kohanim and Chavitim do not require Hagashah, for Kemitzah is not taken;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Hagashah is done only on Menachos ha'Nikmatzos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Papa):</span> Whenever the Mishnah lists the Menachos, each is baked into 10 loaves (alternatively - it lists 10 kinds);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is unlike R. Shimon, who says that Ma'afe Tanur may be brought half Chalos and half Rekikim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source (that these Menachos require Hagashah but not Tenufah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> (Regarding Minchos Nedavah it says "v'Heveisa Es ha'Minchah Asher Ya'aseh me'Eleh la'Shem v'Hikrivah El ha'Kohen v'Higishah.") Had it said only 'v'Heveisa Asher Ya'aseh...", we would think that Hagashah applies only to the Kometz (for only it is la'Shem, i.e. Huktar);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that it applies to the entire Minchah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from '(v'Heveisa) Minchah.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to include Minchas Chotei?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "(v'Heveisa) Es ha'Minchah."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should not need a verse to teach this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Torah teaches about Chovah (Minchas Chotei), and (Minchas) Nedavah. Just like Nedavah requires Hagashah, also Chovah!</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from Nedavah, for it has oil and Levonah, but Minchas Chotei does not!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Minchas Kena'os (of a Sotah) dispels this. It requires Hagashah, even though it has no oil or Levonah.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Each has its own stringency. The Tzad ha'Shavah (common side) of them is that Kemitzah is done, and also Hagashah. Also Minchas Chotei is Nikmetzes, therefore Hagashah should be done.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and Rejection of (6)):</span> We cannot learn from Nedavah and Kena'os, for rich and poor people bring both of them, but only a very poor person brings Minchas Chotei! (Others bring an animal or birds.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Since we cannot learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah,) "Es ha'Minchah" teaches about Minchas Chotei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Shimon says, "v'Heveisa (...v'Higishah)" teaches that the Omer requires Hagashah, for it says similarly "va'Haveisem Es Omer Reishis Ketzirchem El ha'Kohen."</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and Rejection of (6)):</span> We cannot learn from Minchas Chotei and the Omer, for both of them must be Soles (fine flour), but Kena'os can be from (mediocre quality) flour!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, "v'Heveisa (...)" teaches that Kena'os requires Hagashah. It says (regarding Kena'os) "v'Hevi Es Korbanah Aleha";</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon uses a verse to teach about the Omer. How does he challenge the Kal va'Chomer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He does not learn the Omer from Minchas Chotei and Kena'os, for they are (potentially) more frequent than the Omer. (They can occur many times in a year.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>R. Yehudah does not consider this to be a challenge. He considers the Omer to be more frequent, for it is definitely brought every year.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> (R. Shimon and R. Yehudah used "V'Heveisa" to teach about the Omer and Kena'os, respectively.)

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tzibur brings a Chovah from wheat, and also from barley. We should likewise say that an individual, who brings Nedavah from wheat, may also bring Nedavah from barley!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Eleh" - only the Nedavos listed may be brought.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Eleh" rather teaches that one who says 'Alai (it is incumbent on me to bring a) Minchah' must bring all five Menachos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "me'Eleh". He may bring as many as he desires.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "v'Hikrivah (...v'Higishah)." It, i.e. one of the five Nedavos, requires Hagashah, but Minchas Nesachim does not.)</p></div>
