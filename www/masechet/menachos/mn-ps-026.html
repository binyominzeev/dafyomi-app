<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> Even if the Shirayim became Teme'im, were burned or lost, the Minchah is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehoshua says, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav):</span> R. Yehoshua is Posel only when all the Shirayim became Teme'im - if some remained Tehorim, he is Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>We are thinking that Rav says this only regarding Tum'ah, but not if they were burned or lost.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rav's opinion about Shirayim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he holds that a remnant is significant, even if some was burned or lost and some remains, R. Yehoshua should be Machshir;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he holds that a remnant is not significant, even if some was Nitma and some remains Tahor, why is R. Yehoshua Machshir?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He is Machshir because the Tzitz is Meratzeh.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, he should Machshir even if all became Tamei!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, he holds that a remnant is significant;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav said his law regarding Tum'ah, but the same applies if they were burned or lost. He merely mentioned the first case of the Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehoshua):</span> If a k'Zayis of the meat or Chelev of any Zevach remains, we throw the blood;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a half k'Zayis of the meat and a half k'Zayis of Chelev of (almost) any Zevach remains, Zerikah is not done;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The only exception is Olah. Since it is Kalil (entirely burned), meat and Chelev join.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Regarding a Minchah, even if it is totally intact, Zerikah is not done.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Zerikah does not apply to a Minchah! (Haktarah is not called Zerikah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> It refers to Minchas Nesachim. One might have thought that since it accompanies a Zevach, it is just like the Zevach (and if it remains, Zerikah is done to permit Haktarah of the Minchah). The Tana teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehoshua's source?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> "(V'Zorak...Es ha'Dam...) v'Hiktir ha'Chelev l'Re'ach Nicho'ach..." - even if there is only Chelev, but no meat, Zerikah is done.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This shows that Zerikah is done for the sake of Chelev. What is the source when there is only Yoseres ha'Kaved v'Shtei Klayos (other Eimurim)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Regarding a Minchah, even if it is totally intact, Zerikah is not done.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Zerikah is not done for a Minchah, but it is done for Yoseres (ha'Kaved) v'Shtei Klayos (for these are part of the Korban)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> "L'Re'ach Nicho'ach" - Zerikah is done for anything (Huktar) l'Re'ach Nicho'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>The Torah needed to write "Chelev" and "l'Re'ach Nicho'ach";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it written only Chelev, one might have thought that Zerikah is done for Chelev, but not for Yoseres v'Shtei Klayos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it written only l'Re'ach Nicho'ach, one might have thought that Zerikah is done even for Minchas Nesachim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DOES THE KOMETZ REQUIRE A KLI SHARES?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Kometz was not Mekudash in a Kli Shares, it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Shimon is Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If the Kometz was Huktar in two stages (half at a time), it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>(Gemara - R. Yehudah brei d'R. Chiya) Question: What is R. Shimon's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yehudah (brei d'R. Chiya)):</span> He learns from "Kodesh Kodoshim Hi (a Minchah) ka'Chatas vecha'Asham";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Kohen wants to be Maktir the Kometz using his hand (without a Kli), like (Matanos Dam of) Chatas, he uses the right hand, like for Chatas;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he wants to be Maktir it using a Kli, like (Matanos Dam of) Asham, he may use the left hand, like for Asham.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yanai):</span> Once Kemitzah was taken from a Kli Shares (holding the Minchah), Ha'alah (bringing up on the Mizbe'ach) and Haktarah may be from the Kohen's belt, or from an earthenware Kli.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> All agree that the Kometz must be Mekudash in a (second) Kli Shares. (After this, R. Shimon says that Haktarah need not be from a Kli Shares.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1):</span> Ha'alah and Haktarah of Chelev, limbs, wood, Kometz, Ketores and Levonah is Kosher, whether they were by hand or with a Kli, with the right or left hand.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This refutes R. Yehudah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'It is Kosher by hand' refers to the right hand. 'With a Kli' can be using the right or left hand.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Nachman - Beraisa):</span> If Kemitzah was not from a Kli Shares, if the Kometz was not Mekudash in a Kli Shares, or if Ha'alah and Haktarah were not in or from a Kli Shares, it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer and R. Shimon are Machshir if the Kometz was put in a (Chulin) Kli.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It should say, they are Machshir (a Chulin Kli) after the Kometz was put in a Kli (Kodesh).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chachamim):</span> The Kometz requires a Kli Shares:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Kometz is taken from a Kli Shares, Mekudash in a Kli Shares, Ha'alah and Haktarah are with a Kli Shares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says, since Kemitzah was from a Kli Shares, Ha'alah and Haktarah do not need a Kli Shares.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>(This refutes Rav Nachman!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, since Kemitzah and Kidush were with Klei Shares, Ha'alah and Haktarah do not need a Kli Shares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer and R. Shimon):</span> If the Kometz was taken with the right hand and put in the left hand, it must be returned to the right hand;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he had intent Chutz li'Mkomo or Chutz li'Zmano while it was in the left hand (Rashi; Shitah Mekubetzes - after doing Kemitzah with the left hand), it is Pasul, and there is no Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Text of Shitah Mekubetzes, Birkas ha'Zevach):</span> If he had intent Chutz li'Mkomo while it was in (Shitah - after doing Kemitzah with) the right hand, it is Pasul, and there is no Kares.

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chachamim say, once he put it in his left hand, it is Pasul. (It cannot be fixed.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Kometz must be Mekudash in a Kli Shares (like Kabalas Dam in a Kli Shares). Putting it in the left hand is like blood that spilled on the ground (before Kabalah). Even if it was gathered it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Eliezer and R. Shimon do not require Kidush Kli!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>This refutes Rav Nachman, and supports R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This also refutes R. Yanai! (R. Shimon does not allow the left hand for Haktarah, and all the more so a garment!)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Kometz was Huktar in two stages, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> It is Kosher in two stages, but not in more than this;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It is Kosher in two stages, or even in more than two.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do they argue?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> R. Yehoshua ben Levi holds that a Kometz must be at least two k'Zeisim, and Haktarah must be at least a k'Zayis (since it is called 'Achilah');</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan holds that a Kometz can be less than two k'Zeisim, therefore Haktarah can be less than a k'Zayis (since we have a source that Haktaras Kometz can be in two stages).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When does Haktaras ha'Kometz permit eating the Shirayim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chanina):</span> They are permitted after (any part of) the Kometz catches fire.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> They are permitted when most of the Kometz catches fire.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> R. Yochanan learns from "v'Hinei Alah Kitor ha'Aretz k'Kitor ha'Kivshan";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Kivshan (pit that houses a fire) does not make smoke until its majority is aflame.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against R. Yochanan - Ravin bar Rav Ada - Beraisa):</span> We know that things normally offered all night, such as limbs and Chelev, may be brought on the Mizbe'ach and Huktar at night;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to be Ma'aleh (bring up) and to be Maktir after sundown things offered during the day, such as a Kometz, Levonah, Ketores, Minchas Kohanim, Chavitei Kohen Gadol, and Minchas Nesachim?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> Ha'alah and Haktarah may not be after sundown. We said that they are offered during the day!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, the Beraisa asks 'what is the source to be Maktir just before sundown, and they will burn all night?'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Zos Toras ha'Olah" is a Ribuy. It permits this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If Haktarah is just before sundown, the majority will not catch flame before sundown! (If it is not considered Haktarah before sundown, it is Nifsal due to Linah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> When the Kometz catches fire, this is considered Haktarah regarding Klitah (it is food of the Mizbe'ach, so Linah does not apply).

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (also to Interjection - R. Elazar):</span> The Beraisa refers to returning things to the fire after they flew off.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yanai taught that if Ketores came off the fire, even whole sticks, we do not return them!</p></div>
