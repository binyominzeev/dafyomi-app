<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yochanan expound "Osam"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps an individual may bring a Nedavah of Shtei ha'Lechem, and "Motza Sefasecha Tishmor v'Asisa" applies (if he vowed, he must fulfill it)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Korban Reishis Takrivu (plural)" - the Tzibur brings it, but an individual may not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> An individual does not bring Shtei ha'Lechem Chovah, therefore he cannot bring it for Nedavah. The Tzibur brings it Chovah, perhaps it can bring it Nedavah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Osam" (we bring only what is obligatory.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says we offer Se'or and Devash for "Korban Reishis" (first offerings). What are these?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shtei ha'Lechem contain Se'or. (Some) Bikurim are (sweet fruits, which are included in) Devash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One may bring Shtei ha'Lechem Nedavah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> Why must it say both "Chol Se'or" and "v'Chol Devash"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Each has a leniency. We could not learn from the Isur of one from the other;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Se'or is totally permitted in the Mikdash. Devash is not;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>One may eat Shirei Menachos with Devash, but one may not ferment them. (end of Beraisa)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is Se'or totally permitted in the Mikdash?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Shtei ha'Lechem may be offered Nedavah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (to Questions (c) and (3)):</span> No, the leniency of Se'or is that it (Shtei ha'Lechem) is accompanied by other Korbanos (Shalmei Tzibur).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Question Also Devash (Bikurim) is accompanied by other Korbanos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Birds on top of the baskets were Olos. They (people bringing Bikurim) gave what they were holding to the Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The birds are not a necessary part of Bikurim, rather, for decoration.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>FORBIDDEN HAKTARAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> If one offers meat of Chatas ha'Of on the Mizbe'ach, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Torah forbids "Chol... Mimenu... Isheh" - since no part of Chatas ha'Of is Huktar, the Isur does not apply;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, the Isur applies to anything called Korban, and this is called Korban?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> The Isur applies to anything called Korban, this is called Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Tana'im argue about this;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> The Torah forbids (Haktaras Shirayim of) Chol she'Mimenu l'Ishim (anything partially Huktar);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Akiva says, Haktaras Shirayim of anything called Korban is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> They argue about meat of Chatas ha'Of (no part of Chatas ha'Of is Huktar, but it is called Korban.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav):</span> They argue about Log Shemen of a Metzora. (No part is Huktar, but it is called Korban.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Levi - Beraisa):</span> "Kol Korbanam" includes the Log of oil of a Metzora. (Shitah Mekubetzes deletes this entire line from the text.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SHI'UR OF FORBIDDEN HAKTARAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> "Se'or... Lo Saktiru" forbids to be Maktir all of it. What is the source for partial Haktarah? (The entire Beraisa will be explained);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Chol (Se'or...)."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for Haktarah of a mixture?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Ki Chol."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> "Se'or...Lo Saktiru" forbids to be Maktir a k'Zayis;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for half a k'Zayis?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Chol".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for Haktarah of a mixture?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Ki Chol".</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Abaye and Rava argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Abaye holds that a Kometz can be less than two k'Zeisim. Therefore, "Chol" teaches that Haktarah can be (half a Kometz, even though this is) less than a k'Zayis;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">58b----------------------------------------58b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rava holds that a Kometz must be at least two k'Zeisim. Haktarah must be at least a k'Zayis. ("Chol" teaches only about half a Kometz.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one offered (Tosfos - Se'or and Devash and) a mixture of Se'or and Devash on the Mizbe'ach, he is lashed for Se'or, for Devash, and for a mixture of Se'or and for a mixture of Devash;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> One is not lashed for Lav shebi'Chlalos (a Lav that forbids different things).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> He is lashed once (for Se'or and its mixture, and once for Devash and its mixture).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> He is not lashed at all, for the Lavim are not specific like the Lav of muzzling (the prototype for lashes).</p></div>
