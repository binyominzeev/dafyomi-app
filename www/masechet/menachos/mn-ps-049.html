<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISTAKEN AKIRAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> If the two lambs were slaughtered l'Shem rams, they are Kesherim, but Lo Alu. (The Tzibur did not fulfill its obligation.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Alu. (The Tzibur fulfilled its obligation.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Presumably, Rav's law is when the slaughterer thought that they were rams and slaughtered l'Shem lambs, for lambs were slaughtered l'Shem lambs;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, if he thought that they are rams and slaughtered l'Shem rams, Lo Alu. He mistakenly was Oker (uprooted) the Korban (from what it should have been). A mistaken Akirah takes effect.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> A mistaken Akirah does not take effect.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah, against himself - Mishnah):</span> If a Kohen was Mefagel b'Mezid, he is liable (to pay the owner of the Korban);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he was Shogeg, he is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Pigul takes effect (even b'Shogeg).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he knew that it is a Chatas and he slaughtered l'Shem Shelamim, this is Mezid!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He thought that it is a Shelamim and he slaughtered l'Shem Shelamim;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Pigul takes effect. This shows that mistaken Akirah is Akirah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question 3 - Abaye):</span> Really, he knew that it is a Chatas and he slaughtered l'Shem Shelamim. 'He was Shogeg' means that he thought that this is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira - Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> If Kemitzah of any Minchah was Lo Lishmah, it is Kosher and Alah, for Menachos are unlike Zevachim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Kemitzah was l'Shem Marcheshes and it was really Minchas Machavas (which is drier), this is evident (therefore, the intent has no effect);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Kemitzah was l'Shem Blulah and it was really Charevah (without oil, i.e. Minchas Chotei), this is evident;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Zevachim are different. Shechitah and Zerikah are the same for all of them (therefore, Lo Lishmah is not Meratzeh. It even disqualifies some Zevachim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case (of Menachos Lo Lishmah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He knew that it was Machavas, and he did Kemitzah l'Shem Marcheshes.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Even though this is evident, he intentionally was Oker! (Surely, it is not Oleh.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He thought that it was Marcheshes, and he did Kemitzah l'Shem Marcheshes.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Even though he is mistaken, it is Oleh only because the mistake is evident. Otherwise, mistaken Akirah is Akirah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question 4 - Abaye):</span> Really, he knew that it was Machavas, and he did Kemitzah l'Shem Marcheshes;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Zeira said that even though this is evident, since he intentionally was Oker, it is not Oleh. Rabah holds that the Torah disqualifies Lo Lishmah that is not evident, but an evident Lo Lishmah is never Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHICH KORBANOS TZIBUR ARE ME'AKEV EACH OTHER?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Temidim are not Me'akev Musafim. Musafim are not Me'akev Temidim. Musafim are not Me'akev each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If the morning Tamid was not offered, the afternoon Tamid is offered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Shimon says, this is only if it was not offered due to Ones or Shogeg. If b'Mezid they did not offer in the morning, they do not offer in the afternoon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If the morning Ketores (half a Maneh) was not offered, Ketores is offered in the afternoon;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Shimon says, they offer the full daily amount (a Maneh) in the afternoon;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because the inner Mizbe'ach must be inaugurated with Ketores, the outer Mizbe'ach must be inaugurated with a morning Tamid, the Shulchan must be inaugurated with Lechem ha'Panim on Shabbos, and the Menorah must be inaugurated by lighting the seven lamps in the afternoon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Chiya bar Avin) Question:</span> If the Tzibur does not have enough Temidim and Musafim, which has precedence?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Both are for today.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, obviously Temidim have precedence, for they are Tadir (more frequent) and have as much Kedushah as the Musafim! (The Kedushah of the day (Shabbos, or Rosh Chodesh, or...) applies equally to Temidim and Musafim. Alternatively, Temidim are Tadir and more Kadosh, for they are offered first.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Temidim are for tomorrow, and the Musafim are for today:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Temidim have precedence, for they are Tadir;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Or perhaps Musafim have precedence, for they are more Kadosh! (The case is, tomorrow is less Kadosh than today.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda - Mishnah):</span> Temidim are not Me'akev Musafim. Musafim are not Me'akev Temidim. Musafim are not Me'akev each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> There are enough lambs for both of them. The Mishnah teaches that either may be offered first.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that no Korban precedes the morning Tamid?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Arach Aleha ha'Olah" - the Tamid goes (directly) on the wood,</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Also, Rava expounded "ha'Olah" - (the Tamid is) the first Olah. No Korban precedes it.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">49b----------------------------------------49b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> There are not enough lambs for both. (The Mishnah teaches that the lambs may be used for either.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If both were for today, the Temidim would have precedence, for they are Tadir and Kadosh!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Rather, the Temidim are for tomorrow, and the Musafim are for today. The Mishnah teaches that the lambs may be used for either.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (and defense of Answer #1 to questions f:1 and g:1 - Abaye):</span> Really, there are enough lambs for both of them. The Mishnah teaches that either may be offered first;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The law that no Korban precedes the morning Tamid is only l'Chatchilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> We never have less than six checked lambs in the chamber of lambs, the amount needed for Shabbos and two days of Rosh Hashanah. (Sometimes these are three consecutive days. We do not check on Shabbos or Yom Tov. Even though mid'Oraisa, Rosh Hashanah is only one day, we must guard Elul 30 in Kedushah, lest witnesses who saw the new moon come. Retroactively the day was Rosh Hashanah. If the 30th was not Mekudash, also the next day is Kadosh.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> There are enough lambs for Temidim and Musafim.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> More are needed! (We need another 16 for Musafim of Shabbos, Rosh Chodesh and Rosh Hashanah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> There are not enough lambs;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Mishnah teaches that Temidim have precedence. (The chamber contains only enough for the Temidim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question 1):</span> Really, there are enough lambs;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah teaches that there are never less than six lambs that have been checked for four days. The Mishnah is like Ben Bag Bag;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Ben Bag Bag) Question:</span> What is the source that the Tamid must be checked four days before it is slaughtered?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah. It says (regarding the Tamid) "Tishmeru Lehakriv Li b'Moado", and it says "v'Hayah Lachem l'Mishmeres Ad Arba'ah Asar." Just like Korban Pesach had to be checked four days in advance, also the Tamid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> A seventh lamb should be required, for the next morning! (Sometimes there are three consecutive days of Shabbos and Rosh Hashanah, and we cannot look for pre-checked lambs at night!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rav Ashi):</span> An eighth should be required. We should include the afternoon Tamid just before the three days!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah does not count that. It teaches how many must remain after offering the Temidim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Ravina's question remains. It should say seven!</p></div>
