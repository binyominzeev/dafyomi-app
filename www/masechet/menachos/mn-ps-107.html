<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Nesachim are entirely for the Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are poured through the Shitim. (The Mizbe'ach does not consume them.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Minchas Nesachim is entirely consumed by the Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Some Menachos are (mostly) eaten by Kohanim. Presumably the one who vowed intended for something that is always Kalil.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A VOW TO BRING METAL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'Alai Zahav', he must bring at least a gold Dinar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he meant Naska (an ingot; Tosfos - it is a fixed amount less than a Dinar)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> He said 'coins'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he meant Perutos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> People do not make gold Perutos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'Alai Kesef', he must bring at least a Dinar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he meant Naska!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> He said 'coins'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he meant Perutos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> The Mishnah discusses a place where silver Perutos are not used.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'Alai Nechoshes', he must bring copper worth a silver Ma'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> He must bring at least a small fork of copper.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What use is there for this in the Mikdash?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is used to cut off burnt ends of wicks and to clean the ashes out of the lamps of the Menorah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Beraisa - Others):</span> If one said 'Alai Barzel', he must bring iron (at least) enough for Kalyah Orev (to prevent ravens from resting on the Heichal; Rashi - these are spikes, or an iron plate with a sharp edge pointing up; Aruch - it is a scarecrow.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How big must this be?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> It must be one Amah by one Amah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> If one said 'Alai Barzel', he must bring one Amah by one Amah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What use is there for this in the Mikdash?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> It is enough for Kalyah Orev.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>VOLUNTARY NESACHIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'Alai Yayin', he must bring three Lugim of wine;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he said 'Alai Shemen', he must bring one Log of oil;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rebbi says, he must bring three Lugim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If he knows that he vowed to bring a certain amount but does not remember how much, he brings the largest amount that the Tzibur ever brings in one day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "Ezrach" is extra, to permit a Nedavah of wine. Three Lugim must be brought. (We never find less than this.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to allow bringing more?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yihyeh" permits this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one may bring less!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Kachah" (is Me'akev).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he said 'Alai Shemen', he must bring one Log of oil; Rebbi says, three Lugim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabanan):</span> Chachamim hold Dun Minah u'Minah (when a matter is learned from another matter, we learn everything from the source):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learn Nedavah of oil from Menachos. The smallest amount of oil in a Minchah is one Log;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rebbi holds, Dun Minah v'Uki b'Asra (we only learn one law from the source, other laws are according to the law of the matter being learned);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We learn from Menachos that a Nedavah can be brought, but we learn the Shi'ur from Nesachim. The minimum we ever find is three Lugim (of wine).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> Both of them hold Dun Minah u'Minah. If they learned from Menachos, Rebbi would agree that the Shi'ur is one Log.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> Rebbi learns from "Ezrach" (i.e. Nesachim of wine). Three Lugim must be brought.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Noson):</span> That is wrong!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Korban" teaches that Nedavah of wine may be brought. The Shi'ur is three Lugim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> This is like Rebbi, who holds that the Shi'ur is three Lugim. This shows that he learns from "Korban"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Admission (Rav Papa):</span> Indeed, the Beraisa refutes me.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>UNSPECIFIED VOWS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'Alai Olah', he must bring a lamb (or better);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Elazar ben Azaryah says, he brings a Tor or Ben Yonah (or better).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If he vowed to bring Bakar (cattle, for an Olah) but does not remember which, he brings a bull and calf;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If he vowed to bring a Behemah but does not remember which, he brings a bull and calf, ram and (adult) goat, kid (yearling goat) and lamb.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If he does not remember whether he specified an animal or bird, he brings all of these and a Tor or Ben Yonah.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">107b----------------------------------------107b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If he vowed to bring Todah or Shelamim, he must bring a lamb (or a bigger animal);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>If he vowed to bring a specific kind of Bakar but does not remember which, he brings a male calf and a female calf, and a bull and cow;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>If he vowed a specific animal but does not remember which, he brings a male and female of each of the following - cow and calf, (adult) sheep and goat, kid and lamb.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>If he vowed to bring a bull, he must spend (at least) a Maneh (25 Sela'im) for it and its Nesachim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>If he vowed to bring a calf, ram or lamb, he must spend (respectively) at least five, two or one Sela('im) for it and its Nesachim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>If he vowed to bring a bull (or calf, ram or lamb) for 25 (or five or two or one) Sela('im), he must spend this amount for the animal alone, without its Nesachim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>If he vowed to bring a bull for a Maneh and he brought two bulls for a Maneh, he was not Yotzei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even if each is worth almost a Maneh, he was not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>If he vowed to bring a black animal and brought a white one (or vice-versa), or to bring a large animal and brought a small one, he was not Yotzei;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>If he vowed to bring a small animal and brought a large one, he was Yotzei;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>Rebbi says, he was not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> The first Tana and R. Elazar ben Azaryah do not argue. R. Elazar gives the law in his locale (Rambam - there, people call Olas ha'Of (simply) Olah; Rashi - there, birds cost more than lambs), and the first Tana teaches for his locale. (Olah refers only to Behemos, or lambs cost more than birds.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one vowed to bring an Olah for a Sela to the Mizbe'ach, he should bring a lamb, for no other animal can be offered for a Sela.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>If he specified what he will bring for a Sela, but he does not remember what, he brings everything that can be offered for a Sela (also Soles, Levonah...)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>A LARGE ANIMAL IN PLACE OF A SMALL ONE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he vowed to bring a specific kind of Bakar but does not remember which, he brings a bull and a male calf.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should suffice to bring a bull, even if he vowed to bring a calf!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah is Rebbi, who says that if he vowed to bring a small animal and brought a large one, he was not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If he vowed to bring a bull for a Maneh and he brought two bulls for a Maneh, he was not Yotzei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even if each is worth almost a Maneh, he was not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he vowed to bring a black animal and brought a white one (or vice-versa), to bring a large animal and brought a small one, he was not Yotzei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he vowed to bring a small animal and brought a large one, he was Yotzei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Rebbi says, he was not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Will you say that the Reisha and Seifa are like Rebbi, and the middle is Rabanan?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the Reisha and Seifa are Rebbi, and the middle is Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah teaches that (not all agree to the Reisha); Rebbi and Chachamim argue about this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There were six boxes for Nedavah (money to buy Kitz ha'Mizbe'ach, Olos Nedavah of the Tzibur for when the Mizbe'ach is idle).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> Why were there six?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chizkiyah):</span> They correspond to the six Batei Avos (Rashi - subdivisions of each Mishmar of Kohanim), so there will be Shalom between them. (The money is divided equally, so each Beis Av will offer the same amount; R. Gershom - each Beis Av offers whatever is given on its day.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> Because many coins were given for Nedavah, there were six boxes, lest the coins rot.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ze'iri):</span> There was one box for each kind of animal (that one may vow to bring for an Olah, i.e. males) - bull, calf, ram, lamb, goat and kid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like Rebbi, who says that if one brought a large animal in place of a small one, he was not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Bar Pada):</span> The boxes were for (redemption money of Korbanos sent to graze, e.g. if a replacement was offered in place of a lost Korban, e.g.) bulls and goats (of Chatas Tzibur), rams and lambs (of Ashamos), Mosaros (if one was Makdish money for a Korban and did not need all of it, the extra is Mosar) and Kalbonos (small additions to the half-Shekel that everyone must give to Hekdesh each year).</p></div>
