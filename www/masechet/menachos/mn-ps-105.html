<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A STAM MINCHAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, R. Yehudah should always require one to bring the first species that the Torah teaches! (However, he does not!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one said 'Alai Olah', he should have to bring a bull. If he said 'Alai Olah of Tzon', he should have to bring a lamb. If he said 'Alai Of', he should have to bring a Tor (turtledove)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'Alai Olah', (he must bring an animal;) he may bring a lamb;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Elazar ben Azaryah says, he may bring a Tor or Ben Yonah (dove).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> R. Yehudah does not argue!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, R. Yehudah requires Minchas Soles because it does not have an accompanying name (the Torah calls it just "Minchah". The others have an added name, e.g. 'Minchas Machavas', 'Minchas Ma'afe Tanur'...)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa said differently, i.e. it is because the Torah taught Minchas Soles first!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that the choice Minchah without an accompanying name that R. Yehudah refers to is the first one that the Torah taught.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious. R. Yehudah explicitly said that he must bring Minchas Soles!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa merely gives a way to remember which one R. Yehudah requires.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TYPES OF MINCHAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he said '(Alai) Minchah', or 'a type of Minchah'...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If he said 'types of Minchah', what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>'Types' connotes at least two. All the Menachos are also called 'Minchah' (singular) - "v'Zos Toras ha'Minchah";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, since he said 'Minchah', surely he means only one. He means that of the types of Minchah, I will bring one.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If he said '(Alai) Minchah', or 'a type of Minchah', he brings one.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he said 'types of Minchah', he would bring two!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> If he said 'Menachos', or 'types of Menachos', he brings two.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he said 'types of Minchah', he would bring one!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The inferences contradict one another. We cannot determine which is correct, so we cannot resolve the question from here.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> If he said 'a type of Menachos', he brings two of the same type.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he said 'from types of Minchah', he would bring one!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If he said 'types of Minchah', perhaps he would bring two of different types.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa teaches otherwise!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If he said 'a type of Menachos is Alai', he brings two Menachos of one type;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he said 'Types of Menachos are Alai', he brings two Menachos of two types.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he said 'types of Minchah', he would bring one!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beraisa #1 is like R. Shimon, who permits bringing a Minchah half Chalos and half Rekikim. (This fulfills 'types of Minchah');</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim do not allow such a Minchah. They obligate two Menachos of different types.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CAN THE MISHNAH BE REBBI SHIMON?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he knows that he specified which type, but does not remember which, he must bring all five.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmeyah):</span> It is not R. Shimon. (He holds that there are more than five.) He says that one may bring some loaves of a Minchah (Ma'afe Tanur) Chalos, and the rest Rekikim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(If R. Shimon holds like R. Meir, who says that 12 loaves are brought, there are 11 additional possibilities, i.e. perhaps he specified a number of Chalos anywhere between one and 11, and the rest Rekikim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Even if R. Shimon holds like R. Yehudah, who says that 10 loaves are brought, there are still (nine additional possibilities, a total of) 14 types of Menachos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (and Answer #2 - Abaye):</span> It is even like R. Shimon. R. Shimon holds that one may bring and stipulate. (He brings the full number (10 or 12) of loaves of all five kinds of Minchah. He stipulates 'if I vowed a certain number of Chalos and the rest Rekikim, those are for my vow, and the excess Chalos and Rekikim are a Nedavah.')</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> (A Nazir became Safek Tamei Mes. He was also a Metzora Muchlat (totally Tamei, and the Tzara'as went away), and he is unsure if he must perform Taharas Metzora or if he already fulfilled it. He brings Tziporim (birds) today for the first step of Taharah. On day 30, he shaves all his hair.) The next day, he brings a (lamb for) Asham Metzora and a Log of oil, and stipulates:</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">105b----------------------------------------105b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If I need to bring Asham Metzora, this is the Asham and the oil that must be brought with it. If I need not bring it, this lamb is a Shelamim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>(Since it might be Asham Metzora,) it must be slaughtered in the north. Some of the blood must be put on his ear, thumb and toe;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>It requires Semichah and Nesachim (in any case. Some say, it is not a proper Semichah, for Asham Metzora does not require Semichah mid'Oraisa. One may lean on a Korban only when (definitely) fulfilling the Mitzvah of Semichah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>It requires Tenufah of Chazeh v'Shok (in case it is a Shelamim). Only male Kohanim may eat it, for only one day and the following night (lest it is an Asham).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is not difficult for you (R. Yirmeyah), for you explained that R. Shimon allows stipulating (l'Chatchilah) only when this is the only solution. (There is no other way to be Metaher the Metzora to eat Kodshim.) Normally, he forbids it l'Chatchilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection, and summation of objection:</span> Normally, R. Shimon forbids stipulating about a Shelamim (that perhaps it is an Asham), lest this lead to wasting Kodshim. (If it is really a Shelamim, one may eat it for two days, but we may not eat it on the second day, due to our Safek);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>All Menachos are eaten for one day (and a night). L'Chatchilah one may stipulate. This will not cause them to be wasted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Abaye - Rav Papa):</span> (You establish our Mishnah even like R. Shimon. Even though) R. Shimon holds that one Minchah may be (hybrid, i.e.) partially Chalos and partially Rekikim, he can bring an Isaron of Chalos and an Isaron of Rekikim and stipulate;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>How can the Isaron and/or Log of oil for the Minchah he vowed be brought from two separate Esronim/Lugim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Indeed, we know that R. Shimon is Machshir if an Isaron and/or Log was brought from two separate Esronim/Lugim. (Tosfos - we know this regarding an Isaron, for R. Shimon holds that dry measures are not Mekadesh their contents. The source regarding the Lug is not known.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is Kemitzah done?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He takes a Kometz from the Chalos and a Kometz from the Rekikim and stipulates:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Chalos are a Minchah by themselves (and also the Rekikim), the Kometz from the Chalos exempts the Chalos, and the Kometz from the Rekikim exempts the Rekikim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If I vowed some Chalos and some Rekikim, the Kometz from the Chalos exempts those Chalos and Rekikim, and the Kometz from the Rekikim exempts the Nedavah of the additional Chalos and Rekikim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he vowed some Chalos and some Rekikim, the Kometz must be from both of them. A Kometz from Chalos cannot exempt Rekikim, and a Kometz from Rekikim cannot exempt Chalos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, we know that R. Shimon says that if the Kometz consisted only of Chalos or Rekikim, it is valid.</p></div>
