<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>INTERRUPTING BETWEEN THE TWO TEFILIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - (Rav Chisda):</span> If one talked in between the two Tefilin (i.e. after putting on the Shel Yad before putting on the Shel Rosh), he must make another blessing ('Al Mitzvas Tefilin' on the Shel Rosh).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chiya brei d'Rav Huna taught that (normally) 'Lehani'ach Tefilin' is made on the Shel Yad, and 'Al Mitzvas Tefilin' on the Shel Rosh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye and Rava):</span> No, that is when he talked in between. If he did not talk, he blesses only on the Shel Yad.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - R. Tam - (Rav Chisda):</span> If one talked in between the two Tefilin, he must repeat the blessing ('Lehani'ach Tefilin'; he also blesses 'Al Mitzvas Tefilin', which we always make on the Shel Rosh).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chiya brei d'Rav Huna taught that 'Lehani'ach Tefilin' is made on the Shel Yad, and (only) 'Al Mitzvas Tefilin' on the Shel Rosh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye and Rava):</span> That is when he did not talk in between. If he talked, he makes two blessings on the Shel Rosh. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one talked in between the two Tefilin, this is an Aveirah that disqualifies him from fighting in war. (Tosfos - because he caused an unnecessary blessing; Rashi explains, he is disqualified if he did not repeat the blessing, for then he fulfilled the Mitzvah of head Tefilin without a blessing).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One puts on the Shel Yad before the Shel Rosh. When removing them, he removes the Shel Rosh before the Shel Yad.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand the first law - "u'Kshartam l'Os Al Yadecha (and then) v'Hayu l'Totafos Bein Einecha";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, why must one remove the Shel Rosh first?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> "V'Hayu (plural) l'Totafos Bein Einecha" - whenever Tefilin are on your head, you are wearing both.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN DOES THE MITZVAH APPLY?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One blesses on Tefilin from the (earliest normal) time to wear them (when it is light enough to recognize an acquaintance four Amos away):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If someone had to start traveling early (before the proper time to wear them), and for the safety of the Tefilin he must wear them, he wears them. When the proper time comes, he touches them and blesses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Until when may one wear Tefilin?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is permitted until sundown.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yakov):</span> It is permitted until people cease to walk outside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Chachamim):</span> It is permitted until the time that people normally go to sleep.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim and R. Yakov agree (with the first Tana) that if one removed his Tefilin, he may not put them on again after sundown. (Rashi - the Mitzvah of Tefilin does not apply at night; Tosfos - it applies at night, but Chachamim decreed against putting on Tefilin at night.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yakov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Chisda and Rabah bar Rav Huna wore Tefilin during prayer at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Yakov.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">36b----------------------------------------36b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Chisda and Rabah (bar Rav Huna) wore Tefilin during prayer at night!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue with Rav Nachman.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rabah does not permit wearing Tefilin at night!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> When it is doubtfully night, one need not remove Tefilin, and one may not put them on.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> When it is definitely night, one must remove Tefilin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah teaches about Erev Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When does he hold that the Mitzvah applies?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he holds that it applies at night, he should hold that it applies also on Shabbos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he holds that the Mitzvah does not apply on Shabbos, he should hold that it does not apply at night, either!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This is because the same source (that a Tana uses) to exclude Shabbos excludes night.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Galili):</span> (After the Mitzvah of Tefilin it says) "v'Shamarta Es ha'Chukah ha'Zos l'Mo'adah mi'Yamim Yamimah." 'Yamim' excludes nights. "Mi'Yamim" excludes some days, i.e. Shabbos and Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Akiva says, this refers to the 'Chok' (statute) of Pesach (which was discussed before Tefilin).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah holds like R. Akiva, who learns from another source that the Mitzvah does not apply on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one should wear Tefilin on Shabbos and Yom Tov!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Hayah l'Os Al Yadcha..." - the Mitzvah applies only on days when Yisrael need an Os (sign of their closeness to Hash-m), but not Shabbos or Yom Tov, which are themselves signs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> One who wears Tefilin at night transgresses an Aseh;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He transgresses a Lav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue about R. Avin's law.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avin):</span> Wherever it says "Hishamer", "Pen" or "Al", this is a Lav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yochanan holds like R. Avin, and R. Elazar does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, both hold like R. Avin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Elazar holds that when it says "Hishamer" regarding a Lav, this is a Lav. "Hishamer" regarding an Aseh is an Aseh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yochanan holds that in both cases it is a Lav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> One may wear Tefilin at night in order to guard them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> I saw Rav Ashi put on (Shitah Mekubetzes - wearing) Tefilin at night. I asked if this was in order to guard them, and he said 'yes';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>I could tell that really, it wasn't in order to guard them. He holds that the Halachah permits this, but we do not say this to one who asks.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> One must constantly touch Tefilin (when he wears them). We learn from a Kal va'Chomer from the Tzitz;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tzitz has Hash-m's name on it only once, yet the Torah says "v'Hayah Al Mitzcho Tamid." The Kohen Gadol may not cease to think about it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Hash-m's name is written 21 times in each Tefilin (of the hand and head). All the more so one must constantly be aware of them!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ON WHICH HAND DO WE WEAR TEFILIN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (Tefilin are tied on) "Yadcha" - the left arm.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it refers to the right arm!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Af Yadi Yasdah Eretz vi'Ymini Tipchah Shamayim", and "Yadah la'Yased Tishlachnah vi'Yminah Lehalmus Amelim", and "Lamah Sashiv Yadcha vi'Yminecha mi'Kerev Chekcha Chale" - Yemin refers to the right, and Yad (unspecified) refers to the left.</p></div>
