<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CAN A KORBAN TZIBUR BE DIVIDED? (Cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> They argue about whether or not the Tzitz is Meratzeh for food (that Zerikah should permit as if all the food was Tahor, but it does not permit Tamei food to be eaten):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim say that the Tzitz is Meratzeh for food. R. Yehudah says that it is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Noson):</span> (All agree that) the Tzitz is Meratzeh for Olim (things offered on the Mizbe'ach), yet they argue about them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(It is known that if a Korban Tzibur cannot be brought in Taharah, it may be brought in Tum'ah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If one of the Bazichim became Tamei, both may be offered in Tum'ah, for a Korban Tzibur is never divided;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chachamim say, each is offered as it is. (We may not let the Tahor one become Tamei.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rav Ashi - Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Even if (the majority of) one Shevet is Tamei and the rest are Tehorim, all may bring Korban Pesach in Tum'ah, for a Korban Tzibur is never divided;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Korban Pesach does not depend on Ritzuy Tzitz! (Also, the Tzitz never helps for people who are Tamei.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #3 (Ravina - Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If one loaf or Seder became Tamei, both (loaves or Sedarim) are burned in Beis ha'Sereifah, for a Korban Tzibur is never divided;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim say, the Tamei one is burned, and the Tahor one is eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If R. Yehudah argues because he holds that the Tzitz is not Meratzeh for food, this should be his reason!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Rather, R. Yehudah had a tradition that a Korban Tzibur is never divided.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE ZEVACH IS MEFAGEL THE BREAD, BUT NOT VICE-VERSA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Intent (Chutz li'Zmano) in a Todah is Mefagel the bread that accompanies it. Intent for the bread is not Mefagel the Todah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one slaughtered a Todah with intent to eat it tomorrow, it and the bread are Pigul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If one slaughtered it with intent to eat the bread tomorrow, the bread is Pigul, the Todah is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Intent in the lambs (offered with Shtei ha'Lechem) is Mefagel the bread. Intent for the bread is not Mefagel the lambs;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one slaughtered the lambs with intent to eat them tomorrow, they and the bread are Pigul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If one slaughtered it with intent to eat the bread tomorrow, the bread is Pigul, but the lambs are not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the reason (of the first law)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The reason is like Rav Kahana taught:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> Lachmei Todah are called Todah - "v'Hikriv Al Zevach ha'Todah Chalos" (it would have been more natural to say 'v'Hikriv Chalos Al Zevach ha'Todah.' The Torah switched the order in order to read "ha'Todah Chalos."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, similarly, intent for the bread should be Mefagel the Todah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Lachmei Todah are called Todah, but Todah is not called bread.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This does not explain why intent in the lambs is Mefagel Shtei ha'Lechem. Shtei ha'Lechem are not called lambs!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, Lachmei Todah are secondary to the Todah (and Shtei ha'Lechem are secondary to the lambs), but not vice-versa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>The Mishnah must teach both of these:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it taught only about Todah, one might have thought that intent in Lachmei Todah is not Mefagel Todah because they are not waved with it, but intent for Shtei ha'Lechem is Mefagel the lambs, for they are waved together;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>(Had it taught only about the lambs, one might have thought that they are Mefagel Shtei ha'Lechem because they are waved together, but intent for Todah is not Mefagel Lachmei Todah, for they are not waved together.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question (R. Elazar):</span> If one slaughtered a Todah with intent to eat a k'Zayis of it and the bread tomorrow (half a k'Zayis of each), what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Clearly, it is not Mefagel the Todah. Even intent for a full Shi'ur of bread is not Mefagel the Todah, all the more so a Shi'ur combined of two things!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The question is, is it Mefagel the bread? Do the intents join?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Also in your case, the bread is Pigul but the Todah is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches differently!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> Todah joins (with bread) to make (something else, i.e. the bread) Pigul, yet it does not become Pigul. Bread does not (join Todah to) make (the Todah) Pigul, all the more so it does not become Pigul!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (ha'Sar mi'Kutzi, in Shitah (15b:4):</span> Bread does not join to make Pigul, yet it becomes Pigul. Todah joins to make Pigul, all the more so it becomes Pigul! (end of Version #2)</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A case occurred in which Reuven planted (his own) seeds (of other species) in Shimon's vineyard. Chachamim forbade what grew from the seeds, and permitted the vines.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>We do not make a Kal va'Chomer (like above) to say that since vines forbid but do not become forbidden, all the more so seeds, which do not forbid, do not become forbidden!</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> The Torah forbids Kilai ha'Kerem only with hemp and Luf (Rashi - legumes whose seeds do not degenerate.

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If hemp or Luf was planted in a field, other seeds may not be planted there for three years, for these plants produce after three years. (Some texts omit this Mishnah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Chayim, in Shitah):</span> Does Kilai ha'Kerem apply (mid'Oraisa) only with hemp and Luf, but all other species are mid'Rabanan?! (Surely, the Mishnah does not mean this. All are mid'Oraisa!)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Here, the vines are permitted (mid'Oraisa) because one cannot forbid another's property; (end of Version #2)</p></div>
