<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>TENUFAH OF SHELAMIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa):</span> Question: How is Tenufah (of Shelamim) done?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Eimurim (Chelev, Yoseres ha'Kaved and kidneys) are put on the hand. The chest and foreleg are put on top of them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The bread is always on top.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (We do not bring bread with a regular Shelamim.) What does this refer to?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> It refers to the Milu'im. (Shitah Mekubetzes - he did not say Eil Nazir or Todah, even though those apply for all generations, for we learn those from the Milu'im.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are the chest and foreleg on top of the Eimurim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "Shok ha'Terumah va'Chaze ha'Tenufah Al Ishei ha'Chalavim Yavi'u Lehanif Tenufah."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It also says "Es ha'Chelev Asher Al he'Chazeh Yevi'enu"! (The Chelev is on top.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The latter verse discusses when the Kohen brings them from the place of Shechitah, and flips them over (into the hands of another Kohen).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It also says "va'Yasimu Es ha'Chalavim Al he'Chazos"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The second Kohen flips them over into the hands of a third Kohen, who is Maktir them. (Griz asks that only the Chelev is Huktar!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The verses teach that three Kohanim are used. The Avodah is more honorable this way - "b'Rav Am Hadras Melech."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TENUFAH OF SHTEI HA'LECHEM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Shtei ha'Lechem and the two Kivsei Atzeres...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "v'Henif ha'Kohen Osam Al Lechem ha'Bikurim" teaches that the lambs are on top of the loaves!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Al Shnei Kevasim."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this teaches that the loaves are on top of the lambs!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> "Al Lechem ha'Bikurim." The verse contradicts itself. We do not know which must be on top!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We do as is done elsewhere. The bread is on top.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where do we find that the bread is on top?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> In the Milu'im it was on top.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Continuation of Beraisa - R. Yosi ben ha'Meshulam):</span> No, the lambs are on top.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we fulfill "Al Shnei Kevasim"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This (does not teach which is on top. It) merely excludes the seven Olos lambs brought with Shtei ha'Lechem (they are not waved).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Chanina ben Chakinai):</span> The loaves are placed between the thighs (one thigh is above them, and the other below) during Tenufah, to fulfil both verses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rebbi):</span> One would not do this to bread to be served to a mortal king, and all the more so in Avodas Hash-m!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rebbi):</span> Rather, the bread and lambs are waved side by side.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This does not fulfill "Al" (in either part of the verse)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda or Rav Hamnuna):</span> This is like Rebbi taught elsewhere, that "Al" means 'near':</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "V'Nasata Al ha'Ma'areches (of Lechem ha'Panim) Levonah Zakah" - it is nearby.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it literally means 'on'!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Sakosa Al ha'Aron Es ha'Paroches" (we know that the Paroches was not over the Aron! Surely) this means 'near'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He waves them outward and back to himself, and up and down...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> He waves them outward and back (Rashi - in all four directions; Ran - in two directions), to Hash-m, the Owner of the four directions. He waves them up and down, to the Owner of Heaven and earth;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chama bar Ukva):</span> He waves them outward and back, (to ask Hash-m) to withhold bad winds. He waves them up and down, to withhold bad dew.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Rav Avin):</span> This teaches that even a Mitzvah that is not Me'akev withholds punishments;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Tenufah is not Me'akev, yet it withholds bad winds and bad dew.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> Also Lulav is shaken (with the other three species) in this way.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>Rav Acha bar Yakov shook it this way and said 'Satan, this is an arrow in your eye!'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This was wrong. One should not taunt the Satan, lest this this incite the Satan against him.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TENUFAH OF SHALMEI TZIBUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Shalmei Tzibur have Tenufah (mi'Chayim, like the Torah explicitly says, and) after Shechitah. They are waved whole;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chachamim say, (after Shechitah) only the chest and foreleg are waved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda or Rav Hamnuna):</span> Chachamim hold Dun Minah u'Minah (when a matter is learned from another matter, we learn everything from the source). Rebbi holds Dun Minah v'Uki b'Asra. (We learn from the source only what we must. Other laws are like the law of the matter being learned);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim learn from (regular) Shelamim that Tenufah is done after Shechitah. They also learn from there that only chest and foreleg are waved;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Also Rebbi learns Tenufah after Shechitah from Shelamim. However, he learns what is waved from Shalmei Tzibur themselves. (While alive, obviously the entire animal is waved.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">62b----------------------------------------62b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> Also Rebbi holds Dun Minah u'Minah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He learns from Shelamim that we wave the portion given to the Kohen. (There, only the chest and foreleg are given, but Kohanim eat all of Shalmei Tzibur.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ravina):</span> Even Chachamim hold Dun Minah v'Uki b'Asra;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Shalmeihem" is an inclusion (there is another Shelamim, i.e. Shalmei Tzibur, in which only Chazah v'Shok are waved.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> There are three Korbanos and three Mitzvos. Exactly two Mitzvos apply to each of the Korbanos:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A regular Shelamim has Semichah mi'Chayim and Tenufah after Shechitah, but not Tenufah mi'Chayim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Shalmei Tzibur have Tenufah mi'Chayim and after Shechitah, but not Semichah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Asham Metzora has Semichah and Tenufah mi'Chayim, but not after Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that (regular) Shelamim requires Tenufah mi'Chayim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shalmei Tzibur do not require Semichah, yet they require Tenufah mi'Chayim. Shelamim requires Semichah, all the more so it should require Tenufah mi'Chayim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Regarding Shalmei Tzibur it says "Osam." They require Tenufah mi'Chayim, but regular Shelamim do not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that Shalmei Tzibur require Semichah (which is always) mi'Chayim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shelamim does not require Tenufah mi'Chayim, yet it requires Semichah. Shalmei Tzibur require Tenufah mi'Chayim, all the more so they should require Semichah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Ravina):</span> A tradition from Sinai teaches that only two Korbanos Tzibur require Semichah (Par He'elam Davar and Se'ir ha'Mishtale'ach).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that Asham Metzora requires Tenufah after Shechitah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shelamim do not require Tenufah mi'Chayim, yet they require Tenufah after Shechitah. Asham Metzora requires Tenufah mi'Chayim, all the more so it should require Tenufah after Shechitah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Regarding Shelamim it says "Oso". It requires Tenufah after Shechitah, but Asham Metzora does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If five people brought one Korban, one of them does Tenufah on behalf of all of them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Kohen does Tenufah on behalf of a woman or one who sent his Korban with a Shali'ach from overseas.</p></div>
