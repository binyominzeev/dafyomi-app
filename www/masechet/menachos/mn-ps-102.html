<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DO WE CONSIDER IT AS IF ZERIKAH WAS DONE?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is a Mitzvah to do Zerikah with proper intent, yet the Beraisa is Metaher Pigul of Kodshei Kodoshim or Kodshim Kalim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is (even) if Pigul intent was only during Zerikah. (There was a Mitzvah to do a Kosher Zerikah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No. Pigul was during Shechitah. (There was never a chance to do a Kosher Zerikah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If Pigul intent was only during Zerikah, it is Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the Beraisa should have distinguished between more similar cases!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Instead of teaching that Pigul of a Minchah is Tamei, it should say that Pigul of Zevachim is Tahor only if the bad intent was during Shechitah, but if it was during Zerikah, it is Tamei!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must teach that Pigul of a Minchah is Tamei. Even if he was Mefagel in Kemitzah, which is the analog of Shechitah, it is Tamei, for it had She'as ha'Kosher before it was Hukdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (c) and Question 3:f on 101b - Rav Nachman):</span> Here, even if Pigul intent was only during Zerikah, and (regarding Lan) even if time remained in the day for Zerikah, it is Tahor;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon considers something ready to be redeemed as if it was redeemed. He does not consider blood ready for (proper) Zerikah as if (proper) Zerikah was done (since a necessary action was not done. Redemption is not considered an action.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Yehoshua):</span> Me'ilah does not apply to things that had She'as ha'Kosher (were once permitted) to Kohanim. It applies to anything that did not have She'as ha'Kosher to Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are cases of something that had She'as ha'Kosher?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was Lan, Yotzei (left its permitted place to be eaten), or became Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are things that did not have She'as ha'Kosher?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was slaughtered (with intent) Chutz li'Zmano or Chutz li'Mkomo, or Pesulim did Kabalah or Zerikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question - suggestion:</span> The Beraisa says that She'as ha'Kosher is if it was Lan, Yotzei or became Tamei. Lan refers to proper Linah (Zerikah was not done);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>There is no Me'ilah because it is as if Zerikah was done!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer #1:</span> No, She'as ha'Kosher is if it was Lan at a time when it could be was fitting to be Nifsal (only) due to Yotzei or Tum'ah (i.e. after Zerikah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Answer #1:</span> No, She'as ha'Kosher is if it was able to be Nifsal due to Linah, Yotzei or Tum'ah (i.e. after Zerikah). (End of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If there was proper Linah (i.e. Zerikah was not done), Me'ilah applies;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, it should not say that Me'ilah applies if and only if the matter (potentially) did not have She'as ha'Kosher, rather, if and only if it (truly) does not have She'as ha'Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Me'ilah is different than Tum'as Ochlim. Me'ilah depends on Kedushah. Once the Kedushah vanished (because Zerikah may be done, permitting it), it does not return;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Tum'as Ochlim depends on whether or not it is a food. As long as Zerikah was not done, it is not considered food.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> (One who is unsure whether he transgressed a Lav of Kares brings an Asham Taluy.) If Ploni brought an Asham Taluy and then found out that he did not transgress:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he found out before Shechitah, the animal is returned to the herd (it is Chulin);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, it is Ro'eh (grazes) until it gets a Mum, and then it is redeemed. The money goes to Nedavah (Kitz ha'Mizbe'ach);</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">102b----------------------------------------102b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Eliezer says, it is offered. Even though he did not sin in this matter, perhaps he sinned in another matter.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If he found out after Shechitah (it is Pasul), the blood is spilled, and the meat is burned (in Beis ha'Sereifah). If Zerikah was done, the meat may be eaten;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Yosi says, even if the blood is still in the Kli, Zerikah is done, the meat is eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> R. Yosi holds like R. Shimon, who considers blood ready for Zerikah as if it was thrown.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is not R. Yosi's reason!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> R. Yosi holds that Klei Shares are Mekadesh Pesulim to be offered l'Chatchilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Since R. Shimon considers blood ready for Zerikah as if it was thrown, he should also consider something that must be burned as if it was burned. Why do Nosar and Parah Adumah have Tum'as Ochlim? They are like dust!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> Chibas ha'Kodesh is Machshir them to be Mekabel Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> (Saying that Nosar and Parah Adumah have Tum'as Ochlim implies that they can become Teme'im like a Rishon (l'Tum'ah) to be Metamei others (make them a Sheni). Why do they become Rishonim?) Granted, Chibas ha'Kodesh is Machshir to become Pasul (if touched by Tum'ah). Does it Machshir to be a Rishon?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If so, this should resolve Reish Lakish's question!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> (Tzerid of a Minchah (a part that was not mixed with oil, it was not Huchshar) can become Tamei, due to Chibas ha'Kodesh.) Does Tzerid only become Pasul, or is it like a Rishon, to be Metamei other foods, making them a Sheni?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They become a Rishon, at least mid'Rabanan. Reish Lakish asks whether this is mid'Oraisa</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A VOW TO BRING A SPECIFIC KORBAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven vowed to bring (Minchas) Marcheshes and he brought Machavas or vice-versa, it is Kosher, but he did not fulfill his vow.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he said 'Alai to bring (a Minchah of) two Esronim in one Kli' and he brought them in two Kelim, or vice-versa, it is Kosher, but he was not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If he said 'Alai to bring these two Esronim of flour in one Kli' and he brought them in two Kelim, or vice-versa, it is Pasul. (Rashi - we cannot say that it is a Nedavah, nor is it Kosher for his vow, for each Kli is lacking; and only one Kometz will be separated, whereas his vow requires two. Shitah Mekubetzes - he vowed to bring two Lugim of oil with the flour, but only one Log accompanies the Minchah, for it is in one Kli. This is like R. Eliezer ben Yakov.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If he said 'Alai to bring two Esronim in one Kli' and he brought them in two Kelim, and people told him 'you vowed to bring in one Kli':</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he then brought them in two Kelim, it is Pasul. (If he brings it for Nedavah, he would have told them. Rather, it is for his vow.) If he brought them in one Kli, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If he said 'Alai to bring two Esronim in two Kelim' and he brought them in one Kli, and people told him 'you vowed to bring in two Kelim':</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he then brought them in two Kelim, it is Kosher. If he brought them in one Kli, it is like two Menachos that became mixed together. (They are Kesherim if and only if he can take a Kometz from each of them by itself. Above, the Mishnah simply said 'Pasul' without distinction. The case is, it was impossible to take a Kometz from each by itself.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> The Mishnah needed to teach all these cases:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it taught only the first case, one might have thought that he was not Yotzei because he brought it in a different kind of Kli, but when he brought it in the same kind (but wrong number) of Kelim that he vowed, he was Yotzei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it taught only the second case, one might have thought that he was not Yotzei because he divided the Minchah (into smaller amounts), but when he does not divide it (rather, combines Menachos together) he was Yotzei (even if he cannot take a Kometz from each by itself). The Seifa teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> What he brought is Kosher, but he was not Yotzei;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Shimon says, (in all of these cases) he was Yotzei. (His 'promise' to bring it in a certain kind or number of Kelim does not take effect.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he vowed 'I will bring this in a Machavas'...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> The Kli (that he brings it in) is not Mekadesh it. (If so, it should be Kosher. He can put in the proper Kli!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Kli is not Mekadesh it to be Kosher, but it is Mekadesh it to be Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye and R. Acha bar Chanina):</span> The laws of our Mishnah are only when he specified the Kelim at the time of his vow;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he did not specify at the time of his vow, only at the time he was Makdish, it has no effect. You must bring "Ka'asher Nadarta", but not (necessarily) like you separated.</p></div>
