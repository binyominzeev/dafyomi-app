<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE SOURCE OF THE ARGUMENT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Yatzak Aleha Shemen...ve'Hevi'ah El Bnei Aharon ha'Kohanim v'Kamatz" - only after Kemitzah, Kohanim must do the Avodah, but Yetzikah and Belilah of a Zar are Kesherim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Implied question):</span> Why does R. Shimon argue?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He expounds "Bnei Aharon ha'Kohanim" to discuss what precedes it (Yetzikah) and after it (Kemitzah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Elsewhere, R. Shimon does not expound what comes before and after!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Lakach...b'Etzba'o" teaches that Kabalah must be with the right hand.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"B'Etzba'o v'Nasan" teaches that Zerikah must be with the right hand.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> It does not say 'Yad' regarding Kabalah, therefore, if it was done with the left hand it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> They argue whether we expound "b'Etzba'o" to discuss what comes earlier (Kabalah) and/or later (Zerikah) in the verse.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Shimon says that the 'Vov' ("*v*'Yotzak... ve'Hevi'ah El Bnei Aharon") connects the latter Parshah (Kemitzah) to the former (Yetzikah), i.e. also Yetzikah requires Kehunah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "V'Shachat... v'Hikrivu Bnei Aharon ha'Kohanim" - from Kabalah and onwards, Kohanim must do the Avodah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This teaches that a Zar may slaughter.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If R. Shimon expounds a 'Vov' to connect Parshiyos, he should also expound "v'Shachat... v'Hikrivu Bnei Aharon" to disqualify Shechitah of a Zar! (Surely, if he did, there would be a Mishnah or Beraisa teaching this!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There it says "v'Samach... v'Shachat"- just like Semichah of a Zar is Kosher, also Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should say that just like the owner must do Semichah, also Shechitah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches that the owner need not slaughter:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Zerikah is the primary Mechaper, yet the owner need not do it. Shechitah is not the main atonement. All the more so the owner need not do it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps we cannot learn from Zerikah, for the owner cannot do it (unless he is a Kohen), for it requires Kehunah, but the owner could slaughter!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "V'Shachat Es Par ha'Chatas Asher Lo - the Par of Yom Kipur must belong to the slaughterer (the Kohen Gadol), but normally, the owner need not slaughter it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHAT TEACHES THAT SOMETHING IS ME'AKEV?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Wherever the Torah says 'Torah' and 'Chukah', it is Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We are thinking that this is only when it says both of them, e.g. "Zos Chukas ha'Torah..."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Regarding Nazir, it says only Torah, yet Rav taught that it is Me'akev that a Nazir do Tenufah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> There it says "Ken Ya'aseh." It is as if it says Chukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Regarding Todah, it says only Torah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Todah is brought with four kinds of bread. They are Me'akev each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Todah is Hukash to Nazir;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Al Zevach Todas Shelamav" includes Shalmei Nazir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> Regarding Metzora, it says only Torah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The four species used for Taharas Metzora (cedar, hyssop, scarlet thread and birds) are Me'akev each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> There it says "Zos Tihyeh Toras ha'Metzora." It is as if it says Chukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #4:</span> Regarding Yom Kipur, it says only Chukah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The two goats of Yom Kipur are Me'akev each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction (and Answer #2 to questions (b), (d) and (f)):</span> Rather, Rav meant that wherever the Torah says 'Torah' or Chukah', it is Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding other Korbanos, it says "Zos ha'Torah la'Olah la'Minchah...", yet Haktaras Eimurim (of Zevachim) and Hagashah (of Menachos) are not Me'akev!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> When it says Torah, it is not Me'akev unless it also says Chukah. When it says Chukah, even without Torah, it is Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav said 'wherever the Torah says 'Torah' or Chukah''!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He meant that even if it says Torah, it is Me'akev only if it also says Chukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding Menachos it says Chukah, yet Rav taught that wherever the Torah repeats something regarding a Minchah, it is Me'akev;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A matter that is not repeated is not Me'akev!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It says Chukah regarding eating Menachos. This does not teach Ikuv for Hakravah (offering).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It says Chukah regarding eating Lechem ha'Panim (yet we learn Ikuv for Hakravah from this)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The two Sedarim are Me'akev each other. The two Bazichim are Me'akev each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Even when it says Chukah regarding eating, this teaches Ikuv for Hakravah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Menachos are different, for it says "mi'Garshah umi'Shamnah" - only Geresh (i.e. fine flour) and oil are Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHAT IS ME'AKEV THE MENACHOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Wherever the Torah repeats something regarding a Minchah, it is Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Only Geresh and oil are Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Shmuel really hold that when the Torah repeats something, it is not Me'akev?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Surely, he agrees that when the Torah repeats something, it is Me'akev. Rather, he and Rav argue about "Melo Kumtzo" and "b'Kumtzo":</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Melo Kumtzo" and "b'Kumtzo" teach that Kemitzah must be done with the hand. A Kohen may not use a Kli that holds as much as his Kometz.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rav says that this is Me'akev, for the Torah repeated it - "va'Yakrev Es ha'Minchah va'Ymalei Chapo Mimenah";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Shmuel does not learn from the latter verse, which discusses the Milu'im. We do not learn Kodshei Doros (that apply to all generations) from Kodshei Sha'ah (those that applied only temporarily).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel does learn Kodshei Doros from Kodshei Sha'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Klei Lach (Klei Shares that hold liquids) are Mekadesh liquids. Dry measures are Mekadesh dry (Kodshim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Klei Lach are not Mekadesh dry. Dry measures are not Mekadesh liquids.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> This applies only to (liquid) measures, but buckets (even though they hold liquids, i.e. blood) are Mekadesh dry;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We learn from the Menachos in the buckets donated by the Nesi'im - "Shneihem Mele'im Soles." (They were Mekadesh the flour.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is different. Since it is repeated 12 times, we learn Doros from Sha'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana and Rav Asi):</span> The Torah repeated Hagashah, yet it is not Me'akev!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where is it repeated?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Zos Toras ha'Minchah Hakrev Osah... Lifnei Hash-m".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There it is repeated to teach about where Hagashah is done.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Lifnei Hash-m" teaches that Hagashah is in the west!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "El Pnei ha'Mizbe'ach".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "El Pnei ha'Mizbe'ach" teaches that Hagashah is in the south!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Lifnei Hash-m";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>To fulfill both verses, it suffices to do Hagashah at the edge of the southwest corner.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion (R. Eliezer):</span> Perhaps Hagashah may be done at the southern or western side of the southwest corner!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If there are two verses and we can fulfill both of them, we do so, rather than fulfilling one in a way that precludes fulfilling the other;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If Hagashah would be on the west side, we would not fulfill "El Pnei (south of) ha'Mizbe'ach";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>We do it on the south, and we also fulfill "Lifnei Hash-m" (in front of the Heichal).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> R. Eliezer holds that the entire Mizbe'ach is in the north. (The south side is in front of the opening of the Heichal. It is "Lifnei Hash-m". The first Tana disagrees. He holds that the south of the Mizbe'ach was in the south half of the Azarah, opposite the wall of the Heichal. The only place on the south side that is considered Lifnei Hash-m is the southwest corner, from which one can see the opening of the Heichal.)</p></div>
