<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CONSTRUCTION OF THE MENORAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Menorah was nine Tefachim tall.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Simi bar Chiya - Mishnah):</span> There was a rock in front of the Menorah with three steps. The Kohen would stand on it when fixing the lamps. (If it was only nine Tefachim (about waist-height), there would be no need for a stone!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> I meant that the Menorah was nine Tefachim above where the outermost branches meet the central shaft.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Veha'Perach veha'Neros veha'Melkachayim Zahav Hu Michlos Zahav" - what is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami):</span> Shlomo Kilah (exhausted) all his Zahav Sagur (choice gold) on them (the Menoros and their Kelim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Shlomo made 10 Menoros. For each he put 1000 Kikaros (a Kikar weighs 3000 Shekalim) in the smelting pot 1000 times, until it was reduced to one Kikar of ultra-refined gold.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "V'Chol Klei Mashke ha'Melech Shlomo Zahav Ein Kesef Lo Nechshav bi'Mei Shlomo l'Me'umah"! (This shows that he still had plenty of gold!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Ami only said that Shlomo exhausted his Zahav Sagur. (Melachim 1:10:21 says that he used Zahav Sagur in his house. Presumably, he acquired it afterwards.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is so much gold really lost in smelting?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> They once measured the Menorah of Bayis Rishon. It was a Kordikani Dinar (a tiny fraction of a Kikar) more than the Menorah of the Mishkan. They returned it to the smelting pot 80 times, until it was exactly a Kikar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> After 1000 times in the smelting pot, very little is lost if it is smelted again.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> What do we learn from "Al ha'Menorah ha'Tehorah"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> It was made (Tzon Kodoshim; Rashi - shown to Moshe; Maharsha - and also how to make it) from a Tahor place (Shamayim);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, we should similarly expound "Al ha'Shulchan ha'Tahor" to teach that it was made (or shown) to Moshe from a Tahor place!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, we must say that "ha'Tahor" teaches that it can be Mekabel Tum'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Likewise, "Al ha'Menorah ha'Tehorah" teaches that it can be Mekabel Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We understand the Chidush that the Shulchan is Mekabel Tum'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "Al ha'Shulchan ha'Tahor" teaches that it can be Mekabel Tum'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is a wooden Kli made to be stationary. Such Kelim are not Mekabel Tum'ah (even if they are plated with metal)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is considered a Kli that is moved empty and full, because they would lift up the Shulchan on the festival to show the Lechem ha'Panim, to show Bnei Yisrael's dearness to Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the Lechem ha'Panim show Bnei Yisrael's dearness to Hash-m?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> A great miracle was done with Lechem ha'Panim. It was as warm (or fresh) when taken off the Shulchan as it was when placed on it (shortly after it was baked) a week earlier - "Lashum Lechem Chom b'Yom Chilakcho".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of objection (n):</span> What is the Chidush that the Menorah is Mekabel Tum'ah? All metal Kelim are Mekabel Tum'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Defense of Answer #1:</span> Indeed, we must say the Menorah was made (or shown to Moshe) from a Tahor place, even though we expound differently regarding the Shulchan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> Fiery forms of the Aron, Shulchan and Menorah descended from Shamayim. Moshe saw them and (taught Betzalel, who) made them - "u'Re'eh va'Aseh b'Savnisam Asher Atah Mar'eh ba'Har".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should likewise expound "va'Hakemosa Es ha'Mishkan k'Mishpato Asher Hareisa ba'Har" to teach that a fiery form of the Mishkan descended from Shamayim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. Regarding the Mishkan it says "k'Mishpato". (This connotes that Moshe received its Halachos.) Regarding the Kelim it says "b'Savnisam". (This connotes that he saw its form.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Gavri'el descended and showed Moshe how to make the Menorah - "v'Zeh Ma'aseh ha'Menorah."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> Moshe had difficulty understanding three things, until Hash-m showed him (as vividly as) with a finger - the Menorah, (how much of the moon must be seen to declare) Rosh Chodesh and Sheratzim (which species are Tamei);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learn from "v'Zeh Ma'aseh ha'Menorah", "ha'Chodesh ha'Zeh Lachem Rosh Chadashim", and "v'Zeh Lachem ha'Tamei".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Some say, He also showed him laws of Shechitah (the Pesul of Hagramah, i.e. the knife left a ring of the windpipe) - "v'Zeh Asher Ta'aseh Al ha'Mizbe'ach." (Shechitah is the first part of Hakravah.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE WRITING MUST BE COMPLETE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The two Parshiyos in a Mezuzah are Me'akev each other. Even one Kesav (letter) is Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious! (It says "u'Chsavtam". The Kesav must be Tam (complete)!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mishnah teaches that even the Kotz (Rashi - the protrusion on the bottom right; R. Tam - the protrusion on the top left) of a Yud is Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also this is obvious! (If the Kotz is missing, the letter is invalid.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mishnah teaches that if a letter is not (Rashi - entirely; Rashba - at least partially) surrounded by blank parchment on all four sides, (it and therefore) the entire Mezuzah is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Ashi'an bar Nidvach citing Rav Yehudah):</span> If there is a hole in the Toch of a 'Hei' (the left leg; alternatively, the blank parchment in the middle), it is Kosher. If there is a hole in the Yerech (the right leg; alternatively, any part where ink is put), it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Zeira, or Yakov citing Rav Yehudah):</span> If there is a hole in the Toch of a 'Hei', it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If there is a hole in the Yerech (that breaks it into two), if the required size for a letter remains, it is Kosher. If not, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">29b----------------------------------------29b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>The leg of the 'Hei' in the word "ha'Am" in the Tefilin of Agra (R. Aba's father-in-law) was broken into two;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> If the required size for a letter remains, it is Kosher. If not, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>The leg of the 'Vov' in the word "va'Yaharog" in the Tefilin of Rami bar Timri was broken into two;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> Bring a child of intermediate intellect. If he reads it correctly, it is Kosher. If he (mistakes the Vov for a 'Yud' and) reads it 'Yehareg', it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> When Moshe alighted to receive the Torah, Hash-m was tying crowns on the letters.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Moshe:</span> You do not need crowns (Maharsha - to aid understanding, and surely, only You understand their meaning)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> After many generations, there will be a Chacham, R. Akiva, who will learn mountains of Halachos from them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Moshe:</span> Show him to me!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Hash-m put Moshe in the eighth row in R. Akiva's class. Moshe could not understand the class, he felt depressed. A question was asked, and R. Akiva's only answer was 'we know this from a tradition from Moshe from Sinai.' Moshe felt better.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Moshe:</span> He is such a Chacham. Why did You choose to give the Torah through me?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> It was My intent (Iyun Yakov - that you should expound this way. Since you were afraid to look at the burning bush on Har Sinai, you cannot.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Moshe:</span> You showed to me his Torah. Show to me the reward he will receive.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>Hash-m showed Moshe R. Akiva's flesh (which had been torn from him with iron combs) being sold in the meat market.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Moshe:</span> Is this the reward for such Torah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> It was My intent (Iyun Yakov - to create the world solely with Midas ha'Din. R. Akiva fulfills My intent. I also used Midas ha'Rachamim for the sake of most people, who could not survive otherwise.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CROWNS ON LETTERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> There are seven letters that (Rambam - sometimes) have three crowns (protrusions from the top) each (Rashi - on the top left 'Yud'-like part; Nimukei Yosef - on every 'Yud' on top);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The acronym of these letters is 'Sha'atnez Gatz'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> I saw that the most precise scribes are Choter (Tosfos - make a hump in the middle of; Rashi - put a crown on the left end of) the roof of a 'Ches', and they suspend the (left) leg of a Hei (they do not extend it to the roof);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They are Choter the roof of a Ches, to hint that Hash-m is Chai (lives) at the top of the world;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The following explains why they suspend the leg of a Hei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yehudah Nesi'ah):</span> What does it mean "Bitchu ba'Shem Adei Ad Ki b'Kah Hash-m Tzur Olamim"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami):</span> Hash-m is a fortress in this world and the world to come for all who trust in Him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yehudah Nesi'ah):</span> (I did not ask about "Olamim" (worlds). Rather,) I wanted to know why it says "b'Kah"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami):</span> R. Yehudah expounded that Hash-m created two worlds (this one and the world to come) "b'Kah", with the letters Yud-Kei, one letter for each world.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which letter was used for which?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We read "Eleh Toldos ha'Shamayim veha'Aretz b'Hibar'am" like 'b'Hei-bar'am' (He created (Shamayim and Aretz, i.e. this world) with the letter Hei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was this world created with the letter Hei?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Hei is open on the bottom.) It resembles an Achsadra (a house open on one side). Whoever wants to leave (to do evil) is able to do so.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is there another opening above the left leg?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is an opening for those who will do Teshuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't he enter from the same opening he left from?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He will not be able to.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">15.</span><p>Also Reish Lakish taught that one who wants to be Metaher himself needs Hash-m's help;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "Im la'Letzim Hu Yalitz vela'Anavim Yiten Chen" - Hash-m (merely) gives opportunity for one who wants to be Metamei himself (Maharsha - "Hu Yalitz", the person himself scoffs), but to one who wants to purify himself, Hash-m is Nosen Chen (helps him, for he needs help).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">16.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Hei have a crown?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">17.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m will tie a crown to one who does Teshuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was the world to come created with the letter Yud?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (It is the smallest letter.) The Tzadikim that merit to be there are few in number (Maharsha - they make themselves small (are humble).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the top of the Yud bent?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Every Tzadik there bends his head in deference to Tzadikim who performed great deeds that he himself did not.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>CORRECTING MISTAKES IN A SEFER TORAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Rav said two Halachos about Sifrei Torah. Beraisos refute both of them (one of them is absolutely refuted).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Teaching #1):</span> If there are two mistakes on every Daf (parchment) of a Sefer Torah, they may be corrected. If there are three mistakes on every Daf, Yiganez (the Sefer must be buried).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Refutation (Beraisa):</span> If there are three mistakes on every Daf, they may be corrected. If there are four, Yiganez.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If there is one good Daf, it saves the entire Sefer. (One may correct it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Shmuel bar Marsa):</span> This is only if most (Beis Yosef - of the letters) of the Sefer is (are) correct.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Is a Daf with only three mistakes considered 'good' (or must it have no mistakes)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Since that Daf may be corrected, it is considered good (and it saves the entire Sefer).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Genizah is required only due to missing letters, but not if there are extra letters.</p></div>
