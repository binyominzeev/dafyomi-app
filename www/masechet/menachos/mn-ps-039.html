<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>REMNANTS OF TZITZIS (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> The Torah requires making the highest knot (closest to the end of the strings; some explain, closest to the garment);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If this were only mid'Rabanan, we would not need a verse to permit (woolen Techeles strings on) a linen garment. The strings could be inserted without tying them. One does not transgress Kil'ayim for wearing such a garment, since this is not a connection!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rather, the Torah requires making a knot. One would transgress if the Aseh did not override the Lav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Ada):</span> If a string totally snapped, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> (There is a Shi'ur to the length of Tzitzis when making them, but) Shirei (remnants) and remains of Tzitzis of any size are Kesherim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are 'remnants and remains of Tzitzis'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> 'Remnants' are when something remains. 'Remains' are when nothing remains.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions - Rav Nachman):</span> No; the Beraisa teaches one matter. Remnants of remains of Tzitzis of any size are Kesherim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should have said 'remains of Tzitzis of any size are Kesherim'. Why did it mention Shirei (remnants)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that a Shi'ur (a minimal required size) must remain, i.e. enough to make a bow.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah citing Rav):</span> The string wrapped around the others counts towards the required number of strings.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Shmuel said that, and not Rav!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> The string wrapped around the others counts towards the required number of strings.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE WINDINGS AND KNOTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah citing Shmuel):</span> If the Gedil (windings) takes up more space than the Pesil (where the strings lie straight), it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Rav said that, and not Shmuel!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - (Rav Huna bar Yehudah citing Rav):</span> If the windings take up more space than the Pesil, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - R. Chiya brei d'Rav Noson - (Rav Huna citing Rav):</span> If the windings take up more space than the Pesil, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even if there is only one Chulyah (set of windings), it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The ideal proportion is one third windings and two thirds Pesil.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How big should the Chulyah be?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> It must be at least three windings.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One should not have less than seven (Chulyos on each corner; some explain, windings in each Chulyah), corresponding to the Reki'im (firmaments between levels of Shamayim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One should not have more than 13, corresponding to the seven Reki'im and the spaces between them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One should begin (wrapping the first Chulyah) with Lavan, for it says "ha'Kanaf", i.e. strings similar to the corner;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One should end (the last Chulyah) with Lavan, for we ascend in Kedushah, and we do not descend. (Since the Torah teaches that we start with Lavan, it is considered more Kadosh.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>A man was wearing a garment that was entirely Techeles. Gedil was attached, but no Pesil.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">39b----------------------------------------39b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav:</span> The garment is beautiful, but not the Tzitzis;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rabah bar bar Chanah:</span> The garment is beautiful, and also the Tzitzis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah calls Tzitzis "Gedilim". Elsewhere it says "Pesil";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rabah bar bar Chanah expounds that they must be Gedil (wound) or Pesil (straight);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rav say that Pesil is needed in every case. "Gedilim" teaches about the number of strings;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>'Gedil' connotes two. "Gedilim" connotes four. We must make Gedilim and (attach them to the corner and double them over) and make the Pesil from the Gedilim (the string used to wrap them counts towards the required number. Alternatively, leave Pesil (straight strings) below the Gedilim (windings).)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHICH MATERIALS EXEMPT WHICH GARMENTS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Woolen (Lavan) strings exempt (i.e. fulfill the Mitzvah for) a linen garment.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do linen strings exempt a woolen garment?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Wool can be used for Lavan, since it can be used for Techeles (which must always be wool), but we have no source to use linen in a wool garment;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps "Lo Silbash Sha'atnez Tzemer u'Fishtim Yachdav; Gedilim Ta'aseh Lach" permits linen strings in a woolen garment and wool strings in a linen garment;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from Rachbah (that they do);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rachbah):</span> Wool strings exempt a linen garment, and linen strings exempt a woolen garment;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Wool and linen strings exempt all garments, even silk, Klach (waste silk) or Serikin (carded silk).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Rachbah argues with Rav Nachman;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Silk is exempt from Tzitzis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> One must put Tzitzis on garments of silk, Klach and Serikin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is mid'Rabanan. Mid'Oraisa they are exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> Wool and linen strings exempt all of these.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Granted, if the Mitzvah applies mid'Oraisa, this is why Kil'ayim (Sha'atnez) is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, if the Mitzvah is only mid'Rabanan, how can this override Kilayim mid'Oraisa?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, wool or linen strings exempt all of these. (However, wool and linen may not be put on the same garment.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Seifa):</span> (Strings of) each of these materials exempts its own kind, but not other materials.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Granted, if the Mitzvah is mid'Rabanan, Chachamim enacted that they are obligated, and they enacted that the same species may be used for Tzitzis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it is mid'Oraisa, the Torah requires strings of wool or linen!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Torah also allows the material itself, like Rava expounded;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rava):</span> "Ha'Kanaf" connotes strings like the corner (of the same material). "Tzemer u'Fishtim" is only wool and linen!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Wool or linen exempts any material. Any other material exempts only a garment of that material.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Rav Nachman holds like Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> The Torah discusses garments without specifying the material (e.g. in the Parshah of Tzitzis). Regarding other garments it specifies (wool and linen, e.g. regarding Tzara'as, or Kilayim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Just like the latter refers to wool and linen, also the former.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The following Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael argues with the previous Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael) Suggestion:</span> "Beged" refers only to a garment of (sheep's) wool or linen! (Rashi - only they receive Tzara'as; Tosfos - only they are Mekabel Tum'as Sheretz.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Oh (b')Beged" includes garments of camel's, rabbit's and goat's wool, silk, Klach or Serikin (and all other materials).</p></div>
