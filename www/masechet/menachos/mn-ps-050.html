<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana teaches that (at least) six are always there. He merely gives a way to remember it. (Indeed, sometimes seven are required.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> The Beraisa says 'the amount needed for Shabbos and two days of Rosh Hashanah.' It does not say 'for Shabbos...'</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>IF A TAMID OR KETORES WAS OMITTED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the morning Tamid was not offered, the afternoon Tamid is offered... (If the morning Ketores was not offered, it is offered in the afternoon.) R. Shimon says, the full daily amount is offered in the afternoon, because Chinuch (inauguration) of the inner Mizbe'ach must be with Ketores (and Chinuch of the outer Mizbe'ach must be with a morning Tamid).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Shimon mention Chanukas ha'Mizbe'ach? The first Tana did not mention it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated, it means as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the morning Tamid was not offered, they do not offer in the afternoon;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is only if the (outer) Mizbe'ach was never inaugurated. If it was, they offer in the afternoon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Shimon says, this is only if they did not offer due to Ones or Shogeg;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If they did not offer b'Mezid, they do not offer in the afternoon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If the morning Ketores was not offered, Ketores is offered in the afternoon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "V'Es ha'Keves ha'Sheni Ta'aseh Bein ha'Arbayim" - the first Tamid of the day may not be offered in the afternoon;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is only if the Mizbe'ach was never inaugurated. If it was, the first may be offered in the afternoon;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says, this is only if they were Anusim or Shogegim. If they were Mezidim, they do not offer in the afternoon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If the morning Ketores was not offered, Ketores is offered in the afternoon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should not be Mevatel the Mizbe'ach (from the afternoon Tamid) just because Kohanim transgressed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> R. Shimon means that the Kohanim who transgressed (Rashba - the Mishmar) do not offer in the afternoon. Others offer it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Regarding Ketores, there is no such fine. Since there is less opportunity to offer it (the Tamid is an Olah, and Olos may be brought voluntarily, but one may not volunteer Ketores), and the Kohen who offers it is blessed with wealth, Kohanim were zealous to offer it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> They offer the full amount in the afternoon, because the inner Mizbe'ach must be inaugurated with Ketores in the afternoon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> Chinuch must be with Ketores in the morning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The opinion that Chinuch is in the afternoon is more reasonable. It says "ba'Boker ba'Boker b'Heitivo Es ha'Neros Yaktirenah";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Menorah was not lit the previous afternoon, there would be no need to fix the lamps in the morning! (This shows that Chinuch of the Menorah is in the afternoon. The same applies to Ketores, for it  is offered at the time of Hadlakas ha'Menorah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>The opinion that Chinuch is in the morning learns from the outer Mizbe'ach, which is inaugurated with the morning Tamid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Shulchan must be inaugurated with Lechem ha'Panim on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that Lechem ha'Panim may not inaugurate the Shulchan on a weekday, but the bread would become Kodesh! (This is not true.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the Mishnah teaches that Chinuch and Kidush must both be on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Seifa):</span> The Menorah must be inaugurated through Hadlakas ha'Neros in the afternoon. (Hadlakas ha'Neros is only in the afternoon.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This is the Ketores that an individual offered on the outer Mizbe'ach. It was a Hora'as Sha'ah (a special temporary ruling.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> It refers to the Ketores that the Nesi'im offered (during Chanukas ha'Mishkan.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference #1:</span> Normally, an individual may not offer Ketores on the outer Mizbe'ach, but he may offer on the inner Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference #2:</span> Normally, an individual may not offer Ketores on the outer Mizbe'ach, but the Tzibur may!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Motza Sefasecha Tishmor v'Asisa" applies even to Ketores (an individual may bring a Nedavah of Ketores)!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Answer: The Mishnah teaches a bigger Chidush:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is a small Chidush that the Tzibur may not offer (Ketores) on the outer Mizbe'ach, and individuals may not offer on the inner Mizbe'ach, for there is no precedent for either of these;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Further, even individuals may not offer on the outer Mizbe'ach, even though the Nesi'im did so. That was a Hora'as Sha'ah.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> Your Beraisa is like Tana d'Vei Rabah bar Avuha, who says that even Pigul (a very stringent Isur) requires Ibur Tzurah.</p></div>
