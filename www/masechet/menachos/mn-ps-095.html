<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE SHAPE OF LECHEM HA'PANIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against R. Yochanan - Beraisa #1):</span> There was a mold (Tosfos - perforated) like a basket in the oven. It was like a square plate.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The top was square. (The dough was inserted from above, but it rested on the bottom, which was shaped like a ship.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan - Beraisa #2):</span> There were four golden Snifin Mefutzalim (Rashi - with many branches; Tosfos - with holes, in which poles were inserted) to support the bread, which was shaped like a ship. (This does not refute R. Chanina, for R. Yosi (96b) says that the rim around the Shulchan sufficed to support the bread. Surely he holds like R. Chanina! Further, Beraisa #1 and our Mishnah are probably like R. Chanina. The answers given for R. Yochanan were weak. Now that we can say that R. Yochanan holds like Beraisa #2, we do not rely on those answers.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>LECHEM HA'PANIM IN THE MIDBAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would Lechem ha'Panim become Pasul when the Machanos traveled?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Yochanan and R. Yehoshua ben Levi argue about this. One says yes, and the other says no.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first opinion learns from "Ka'asher Yachanu Ken Yisa'u." Just like at the time of Chaniyah (when Yisrael were encamped), Lechem ha'Panim is Nifsal through Yotzei (leaving Chatzer ha'Mishkan), also when they traveled;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The latter opinion learns from "v'Lechem ha'Tamid Alav Yihyeh." (It always keeps its Kedushah.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He expounds just the contrary! Just like when Yisrael were encamped, Lechem ha'Panim was not Nifsal as long as it remained in its place, also when they traveled. (It is Kosher as long as it remained in its place, i.e. on the Shulchan.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> How can the first opinion expound "v'Lechem ha'Tamid Alav Yihyeh"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Dimi):</span> All agree that if the bread remained on the Shulchan, it is not Nifsal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue about when it was removed. The first opinion learns from "Ka'asher Yachanu..." - just like at the time of Chaniyah, Lechem ha'Panim is Nifsal through Yotzei, also when they traveled;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The latter opinion learns from "v'Nosa Ohel Mo'ed." Even when it is travelling, it is called Ohel Mo'ed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the latter opinion expound "Ka'asher Yachanu..."?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Just like at the time of Chaniyah, Lechem ha'Panim is Kosher as long as it is not Yotzei, also when they traveled.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the first opinion expound "v'Nosa Ohel Mo'ed"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches about the order of travelling. (They carry the Mishkan after Degel Reuven and before Degel Efrayim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The latter opinion learns this from "Machaneh ha'Leviyim b'Soch ha'Machanos."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1):</span> When the Machanos traveled, Kodshim became Pesulim, Zavim were expelled from the boundaries of Shevet Levi, and Metzora'im were expelled from Machaneh Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Even Lechem ha'Panim becomes Pasul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, Kodshim other than Lechem ha'Panim are Nifsalim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In any case, this is difficult!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is called Ohel Mo'ed even when travelling, also Kodshim should not be Nifsalim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it is not called Ohel Mo'ed when travelling, also Lechem ha'Panim should be Nifsal!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ravin):</span> R. Yochanan and R. Yehoshua ben Levi do not argue. One teaches that Lechem ha'Panim is Kosher as long as it remains on the Shulchan. The other teaches that it is Nifsal (at the time of travelling) if it is removed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference (Abaye):</span> We learn from this that the Machanos would sometimes travel at night;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> If they would never travel at night (i.e. they would begin travelling only at the beginning of the morning), the Kodshim would be Pasul due to Linah (even if it was not Yotzei!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> (One opinion taught that Lechem ha'Panim that was removed from the Shulchan is Nifsal at the time of travelling. Surely, they never traveled on Shabbos, due to Hotza'ah and Mechamer.) If they would never travel at night (in particular, Motzei Shabbos), the earliest time to travel (after removing Lechem ha'Panim on Shabbos) would be the following morning. The Lechem would be Pasul due to Linah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious. It says "Laleches Yomam va'Laylah"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that this is only if they started travelling during the day, but they do not start at night. Abaye teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (to Beraisa #1 - Beraisa #2):</span> When the Paroches was rolled up, Zavim and Metzora'im are permitted (in Machaneh Levi).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Beraisa #2 is like R. Eliezer. Beraisa #1 is like Chachamim (who argue with him):</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">95b----------------------------------------95b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps if a Zav or Metzora entered the Azarah when Korban Pesach is being brought b'Tum'ah (because most of Yisrael, the Kohanim or Klei Shares are Teme'im), he is liable!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Vi'Shalchu Min ha'Machaneh Kol Tzaru'a v'Chol Zav v'Chol Tamei la'Nefesh" - a Zav or Metzora is forbidden (with Kares) to enter the Azarah only when a Tamei Mes is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHERE THE SHTEI HA'LECHEM AND LECHEM HA'PANIM ARE MADE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The places Kosher to make Lechem ha'Panim and Shtei ha'Lechem are the same:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The kneading and Arichah (arranging the dough into loaves) are done outside (the Azarah). They are baked inside. They are not Docheh Shabbos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, all of these are done inside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Shimon says, accustom yourself to say that Shtei ha'Lechem and Lechem ha'Panim are Kesherim in the Azarah or (even outside the Azarah,) in Beis Pagi (inside Yerushalayim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Gemara) Question:</span> It says that the kneading and Arichah are done outside. This implies that the dry measures were not Mekudashos. (If not, they would be Mekadesh the Soles, and it would be disgraceful to take it out of the Azarah - Tosfos; Rashi - it would become Pasul if it left);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Then it says that they are baked inside. This implies that the dry measures were Mekudashos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> This question was asked by a great Chacham, i.e. Rav Sheshes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is not difficult. Perhaps the Isaron was not Mekudash, but the oven was!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question:</span> It says that they are baked inside. This implies that the oven was Mekudash;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It also says that they are not Docheh Shabbos. If so, they must be baked on Erev Shabbos. They should be Nifsalim through Linah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> This question was asked by a great Chacham, Rav Sheshes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> This is not difficult. Perhaps 'inside' does not mean 'in the Azarah', rather, in a place of zealous people (i.e. Kohanim, who bake it quickly (Rashi; R. Gershom - they oversee the baking) and do not allow it to become Chametz. Nimukei ha'Griv - regarding Shtei ha'Lechem, which must be Chametz, they will be zealous to prepare it properly.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is wrong!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If we require Kohanim for baking, we should require them also for kneading and Arichah! (However, the Mishnah permits this outside, i.e. Zarim may do this);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If we do not require Kohanim for kneading or Arichah, we should not require them for baking! (Tosfos - we must say that different Tana'im taught these clauses of the Mishnah.) (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> All of these are done inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu bar Kahana):</span> R. Yehudah and R. Shimon both expound the same verse "v'Hu Derech Chol Af Ki ha'Yom Yikdash ba'Kli";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, David found Kohanim (in Nov) baking Lechem ha'Panim on Erev Shabbos, and corrected them;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Do you bake on a Chol day, even though it will become Mekudash in a Kli (the oven)?! It will become Nifsal through Linah!</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>You should bake on a Chol day (Erev Shabbos)! Do you think that the oven would be Mekadesh it, and it would be Nifsal through Linah? The oven is not Mekadesh. Only the Shulchan is Mekadesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot say that he found them baking. It says "va'Yiten Lo ha'Kohen Kodesh Ki Lo Hayah Sham Lechem Ki Im Lechem ha'Panim ha'Musarim mi'Lifnei Hash-m"! (Lechem ha'Panim was removed from the Shulchan, at that very time the new Lechem (which was already baked) was put in its place.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we explain "v'Hu Derech Chol..."?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They had told David that the only bread they have is the Lechem ha'Panim which was removed from the Shulchan;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He responded, (in my condition) not only this is permitted to me, for Me'ilah no longer applies to it (since it is permitted to Kohanim), it is like Chulin.

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The argument of R. Yehudah and R. Shimon is based on what they received from their Rebbeyim.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah - R.
