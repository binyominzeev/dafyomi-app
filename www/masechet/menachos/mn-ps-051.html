<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE AMOUNT OF OIL IN CHAVITIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rava):</span> "Al Machavas" teaches that they must be cooked in a Kli Shares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Kli is Mekadesh. If they were cooked the previous day, they would be Nifsalim due to Linah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Rava - Beraisa):</span> "Al Machavas" teaches that they must be cooked in a Kli Shares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Ba'Shemen" teaches that we add extra oil to them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know how much to add?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Here it says 'Shemen', like it says about Minchas Nesachim (for a lamb). Just like there, there are three Lugim (of oil) for an Isaron (of flour), also here.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It also says 'Shemen' regarding Minchas Nedavah. Perhaps we should learn from there, that there is only one Log for an Isaron!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable to learn from Minchas Nesachim, for this resembles Chavitim regarding TaBSHaT, i.e. Tadir (or Tamid, both are brought twice daily), Ba'ah Chovah (there is an obligation to bring them; Rashi's text omits this; the acronym is TaShaT), and both are Docheh Shabbos and Tum'ah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps we learn from Minchas Nedavah, for this resembles Chavitim regarding YaGYL, i.e. a Yachid (individual) brings them, they are brought Galal Atzmo (on their own accord), they are not brought with Yayin (Rashi's text omits this; the acronym is YaGaL), and they are brought with Levonah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yishmael, son of R. Yochanan ben Brokah):</span> "Soles Minchas Tamid" - Chavitim are like Minchas Tamid. It has three Lugim of oil for an Isaron.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Shimon):</span> The Torah taught that Chavitim are made with extra oil, just like the Minchas Keves (Nesachim brought with a lamb);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Just like Minchas Keves is three Lugim per Isaron, also Chavitim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah taught that also Menachos brought with bulls and rams are made with extra oil, i.e. two Lugim per Isaron. Perhaps we should learn from them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable to learn [Chavitim, which are from] one Isaron from [the Minchah for a lamb, which is] one Isaron, than from [that for a ram or bull, which is] two or three Esronim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tana learned from "ba'Shemen" that we add extra oil to them. How can he later suggest learning from Minchas Nedavah (which has the minimal amount of oil?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> R. Shimon is the first Tana. He learns from "ba'Shemen" that we add extra oil. He gave Answer #3 above. He did not suggest learning from Minchas Nedavah (Question 3:i);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yishmael interrupted and suggested this, for he does not expound 'ba'Shemen' like R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> R. Yishmael taught the entire Reisha:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>First he assumed that ba'Shemen teaches that we add extra oil, since we do not need it to teach one Log;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We know one Log from "Al Machavas" - it is like Minchas Machavas.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Later, he retracted. We cannot learn from "Al Machavas", for one might have thought that Chavitim are dry, like Minchas Chotei. Therefore, we need ba'Shemen to teach one Log;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Therefore, he suggested learning from Minchas Nedavah, i.e. only one Log!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>He tried to show that it is more reasonable to learn from Minchas Nesachim, but failed (for there are just as many similarities to Minchas Nedavah).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>Therefore, he needs to learn from "Soles Minchas Tamid."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rabah):</span> R. Shimon taught the entire Reisha:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Really, ba'Shemen teaches that we add extra oil, since we do not need it to teach one Log. We know one Log from "Al Machavas", it is like Minchas Machavas.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He asks (rhetorically), why do we need ba'Shemen to teach about extra oil? Even without this, we would learn from Minchas Nesachim!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He then shows that it is just as reasonable to learn from Minchas Nedavah, therefore we need ba'Shemen.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Finally, he asks why we learn from Minchas Keves (and not from bulls or rams). He answers that it is more reasonable to learn one Isaron from one Isaron...</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> If (the Kohen Gadol died after offering half in the morning, and) a new Kohen was not appointed, who supplies the Chavitim (until a new Kohen is appointed)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Shimon):</span> The Tzibur pays for it (from Terumas ha'Lishkah);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehudah):</span> The heirs pay for it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>A full Isaron is brought.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Question:</span> If the Kohen Gadol died and a new Kohen was not appointed, what is the source that his heirs supply the Chavitim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yehudah):</span> "Veha'Kohen ha'Mashi'ach Tachtav mi'Banav Ya'aseh Osah."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is offered in halves (like when the Kohen Gadol was alive)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Osah" - all is offered (at once), not half at a time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Shimon):</span> "Chok Olam" - it is offered from the Tzibur;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Kalil Taktar" - it is entirely Huktar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Veha'Kohen ha'Mashi'ach..." teaches something else!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Zeh Korban Aharon u'Vanav Asher Yakrivu la'Shem b'Yom Himashach Oso" equates Aharon and his children! (Aharon brings this Korban on the day of his inauguration, just like his children.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Asher Yakrivu la'Shem" - Aharon brings by himself, and his children bring by themselves. (If every Kohen were the same, it would have said Yakriv (singular), just like b'Yom Himashach Oso (on the day of his inauguration) is singular. Rather, the plural teaches that (only) his children bring only on their first day. The verse procedes to say "Tamid" to teach that Aharon brings this Minchah every day.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>'Banav' refers to regular Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it refers to Kohanim Gedolim (after Aharon)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Veha'Kohen ha'Mashi'ach Tachtav mi'Banav" refers to Kohanim Gedolim, so 'Banav' must refer to regular Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If "Veha'Kohen ha'Mashi'ach..." taught only that heirs bring the Chavitim, it should have said '...Tachtav Banav Ya'asu Osah';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, it says "Tachtav mi'Banav" to teach both laws.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Shimon expound "Osah"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that if the Kohen Gadol died (after offering half in the morning) and a new Kohen was appointed, in the afternoon he may not bring (only) half, nor offer the half remaining from the morning. (Rather, he must bring a full Isaron.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learn this from: "u'Machatzisah ba'Erev"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon does not expound the 'Vov'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yehudah expound "Chok Olam"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This Chok (Minchas Chinuch) applies forever.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does he expound "Kalil Taktar"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> The Torah teaches that Chavitei Kohen Gadol are entirely Huktar, then it forbids eating Minchas Kohen (Hedyot) with a Lav;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the first law (Kalil) applies to the latter (Minchas Kohen), and that the latter (a Lav against eating) applies to the first (Chavitim)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Gezerah Shavah "Kalil-Kalil" teaches that both laws apply to both Menachos.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ENACTMENTS OF BEIS DIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon learned from verses that the Tzibur brings Chavitim (when there is no Kohen Gadol). However, he holds that this is only mid'Rabanan!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> Beis Din made seven enactments (regarding paying for Korbanos or benefit from Hekdesh. The first is that if Reuven found an animal near Yerushalayim (perhaps it is a lost Korban) and wanted to bring Korban(os) on behalf of the loser, Reuven must bring the Nesachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>At first, Beis Din would take a security from Reuven. Due to this, finders would flee. They enacted that the Tzibur brings the Nesachim. The Gemara now brings the other enactments.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If a Nochri sent an Olah to be offered in the Mikdash and (money for) its Nesachim, we offer the Nesachim from his money;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he sent an Olah without Nesachim, the Tzibur pays for the Nesachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If a convert died (without heirs) leaving over Zevachim -</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he left (money for) Nesachim, they are offered. If not, the Tzibur pays for the Nesachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If the Kohen Gadol died and a new Kohen was not appointed, the Tzibur supplies the Chavitim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> There were two enactments (about Chavitim):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Mid'Oraisa, the Tzibur pays for it. This was depleting the Shekalim (for Korbanos Tzibur. In Bayis Sheni, almost every Kohen Gadol died in his first year), so they enacted to take the money from the Kohen's heirs;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim saw that the heirs were negligent (about bringing it), so they reverted to Torah law.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of Mishnah):</span> They enacted that Me'ilah does not apply to the ashes of Parah Adumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is a Torah law!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Chatas Hi" teaches that Me'ilah applies to the Parah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Hi" teaches that Me'ilah applies to it, but not to its ashes.</p></div>
