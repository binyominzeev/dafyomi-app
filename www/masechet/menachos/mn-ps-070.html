<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>REPLANTING GRAIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> What is the law regarding Ma'aser?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ears were harvested, tithed, planted and grew;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the Ikar does not determine the law, the added growth must be tithed. Must also the Ikar be tithed again?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> This should be like any grain that is planted! (It must be tithed.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Clarification (Rabah):</span> I do not ask about species in which the seed decomposes. (Surely, all the growth is new, so it must be tithed);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>I ask about things in which the 'seed' (what is planted, in this case the ear) remains;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The following teaches that it must be tithed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> If an onion was tithed and planted, Ma'aser must be taken on all of it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is different, for onions are normally planted. Ears are not normally planted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Chanina bar Minyomi):</span> What is the law of an Atzitz she'Eino Nakuv (a flowerpot without a hole)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Clearly, the Chiyuv to tithe it is only mid'Rabanan!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps you ask what is the law if later it was punctured? (Rashi - may we take its tithes from itself? Shitah Mekubetzes - if one tithes from other produce on it, how much must be taken?) (The next lines (until (i)) are from the text brought in the margin.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> Yes!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> This is Rabah's question! (Is the Ikar Batel to the additional growth?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Shitah - do we tithe to exempt the entire amount, or only for the added growth? Rashi - if only the added growth must be tithed (mid'Oraisa), we cannot separate the tithes from it itself. Perhaps the part we will take is exempt, it cannot exempt what is liable!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Chanina):</span> This is unlike Rabah's question. Here, it was all one planting (just it became Chayav mid'Oraisa). There, it was replanted. (Perhaps what was planted becomes Chayav.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Avahu):</span> If Miru'ach was done to a pile, one of the ears was planted and the owner made it Terumah (while it was attached), what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since it became ('fixed') Tevel (it may not be eaten, even casually, before taking Terumah), so it can become Terumah even when attached;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, since it was planted, it ceases to be ('fixed') Tevel. It is like regular attached produce, and it cannot become Terumah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabanan):</span> Surely, the first possibility is wrong. We never find attached Terumah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> We never find that one is liable Misah bi'Ydei Shamayim or adds a fifth for eating attached Terumah, but this is for a different reason! (I.e. it really is Terumah, just one cannot eat it normally.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one detaches it and eats it, it is not attached;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If one eats it while it is attached, this is abnormal. It is not considered eating!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different than the following teaching, which was written on the ledger of Ilfa (an Amora?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If eggs of Nivlas Of Tahor are partially inside the bird, Tum'as Beis ha'Bli'ah applies to one who eats what is inside, but not to one who eats what is outside.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>(Even though it is not normal to eat eggs inside a carcass, it is considered eating!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is normal to eat something inside something detached, but it is not normal to eat something attached to the ground.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Tivyomi bar Kisna):</span> If one plants Kilayim in an Atzitz she'Eino Nakuv, it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Had he taught that one is lashed for this, that would be a Chidush;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>What is the Chidush to say that it is forbidden, i.e. mid'Rabanan this is considered planting? A Mishnah teaches this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Terumah was taken from an Atzitz she'Eino Nakuv to exempt Peros of an Atzitz Nakuv, it is Terumah, and Terumah must be taken again.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE FIVE GRAINS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (Doughs made from any of) the following are Chayav in Chalah - wheat, barley, Kusmin, Shiboles Shu'al, Shifon. They join with each other (this will be explained);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One may not eat Chodosh of these grains before the Omer (this is the text of most Meforshim), or to harvest them before Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If Hashrashah was before the Omer, the Omer permits them. If not, they are forbidden until nest year's Omer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Kusmin is a type of wheat (it is also a type of barley), Shiboles Shu'al and Shifon are types of barley;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Kusmin is spelt. Shiboles Shu'al is oats. Shifon is rye.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">70b----------------------------------------70b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>These grains are Chayav in Chalah, rice and millet are exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that these are exempt?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Lechem-Lechem" from Matzah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "v'Hayah ba'Achalchem mi'Lechem ha'Aretz (Tarimu Terumah la'Shem, i.e. Chalah)", and Matzah is called "Lechem Oni".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Matzah must be of the five grains?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> "Lo Sochal Alav Chametz Shiv'as Yamim Tochal Alav Matzos" - Matzah must be made from something that can become Chametz. Rice and millet cannot become Chametz (they merely spoil).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They join with each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Grain, flour and dough join with each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding what Halachah do they join with each other?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Kahana):</span> They join (to the Shi'ur of a k'Zayis to be liable) for (eating) Chodosh;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> They join for Chametz;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> They join for Ma'aser Sheni (one who eats a k'Zayis outside Yerushalayim is lashed);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rava):</span> They join (to the Shi'ur of the volume of an egg) for Tum'as Ochlim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that grain and flour must be similar to dough in order to join, i.e. the food itself without waste.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Wheat joins (other foods for Tum'as Ochlim) whether or not it was shelled. Barley joins only if it was shelled. (Even the barley itself does not join, for the shell separates between it and the edible food.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> (Tum'ah applies to) "Kol Zera Zeru'a" - the way people plant seeds. The wheat, barley or lentils are still in their shells.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer:</span> If the shell is wet, it joins (for it is edible. Alternatively, for it is a proper Shomer, it will not fall off), if it is dry, it does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rambam 5:</span>12) Answer: If the shell is wet, it does not join. If it is dry, it joins. (Kesef Mishnah - it is normally planted when dry.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN ONE MAY HARVEST CHODOSH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not eat Chodosh of these grains before the Omer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> A Gezerah Shavah "Lechem-Lechem" from Matzah teaches that (Tosfos; Rashi - only) these are forbidden before the Omer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not harvest them before Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Reishis-Reishis" from Chalah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1A (our text, Rashi) Question:</span> What is the meaning of  '(one may not eat) before the Omer'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1B (Tosfos) Question:</span> What is the meaning of  (one may not harvest) 'before Pesach? (End of Version #1B)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yonah):</span> It means 'before the Omer is harvested' (but it is permitted at dawn of the 16th, before the Omer is offered. Shitah Mekubetzes switches the opinions of R. Yonah and R. Yosi, to conform with Version #2 below. Birkas ha'Zevach switches the opinions below.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yosi Barzavda):</span> It means 'before Hakravas ha'Omer.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Mishnah):</span> One may not eat Chodosh of these grains before the Omer, or harvest them before Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(One may not harvest on Yom Tov. It is forbidden until the second night of Pesach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Granted, according to R. Yosi, the Tana had to teach separately when each of these is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1A (Rashi):</span> However, according to R. Yonah, both are forbidden until the Omer is harvested. It should say 'one may not eat or harvest before the Omer! (Even though eating is forbidden until dawn, perhaps the harvest will be done just before this, so there is very little difference between these times.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1B (Tosfos):</span> However, according to R. Yonah, both are forbidden until the Omer is offered. It should say 'one may not eat or harvest before the Omer!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> The Amora'im argue about the Seifa of the Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If Hashrashah was before the Omer, the Omer permits them...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of 'before the Omer'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yonah):</span> It means 'before the Omer is harvested.'</p></div>
