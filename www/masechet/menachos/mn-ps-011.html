<p class="dedicationbox">MENACHOS 11 (10 Elul) - This Daf has been dedicated in honor of the Yahrzeit of Sheina Basha (daughter of Yakov and Dora) Zuckerman, who passed away on 10 Elul, by her children and sons in law. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A KOMETZ THAT IS TOO BIG OR TOO SMALL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Kometz included a pebble, grain of salt, or grain of Levonah, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must all of these be taught?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All three cases are needed:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it taught only about a pebble, one might have thought that this disqualifies because pebbles are not offered, but salt is offered, so it is not Posel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it taught only about salt, one might have thought that this is Posel for it was not originally part of the Minchah, but Levonah was part of the Minchah, so it is not Posel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Mishnah teaches that even Levonah is Posel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> This is because a Kometz that is too big or Chaser is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if it was not (too big or) Chaser, it would be Pasul, for it is a Chatzitzah (between the Kometz and his hand. Alternatively, it divides the Kometz itself!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> The Mishnah must teach about when it is at the side. (It is not a Chatzitzah.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HOW KEMITZAH IS DONE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> How is Kemitzah done?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It is the way people normally do this (with all the fingers).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> (Each finger is needed for Kodshim. The pinky is used to measure) the Zeres (the length of the Choshen, the ring finger is the first finger used for) Kemitzah, (the middle finger is used to measure) an Amah, the index finger (is for Haza'as Dam), the thumb (is for Matanos Dam and oil on a Metzora. Since the ring finger is the first finger for Kemitzah, this shows that not all fingers are used!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> I meant that all the fingers are used, but not that they all hold flour. The pinky and thumb only wipe away any excess sticking out of the middle three fingers.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the ring finger begin Kemitzah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Mar Zutra bar Tuvya):</span> He bends back the middle three fingers until the palm, taking the flour inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Melo (full) Kumtzo" teaches that it should be overflowing!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "B'Kumtzo" (it must be inside his hand).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "b'Kumtzo" teaches that he should curl the fingers tightly!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It must be "Melo Kumtzo."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> He bends back the middle three fingers until the palm, taking the flour inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>In Minchas Machavas or Marcheshes, he wipes away the excess using the pinky and thumb. This is the hard Avodah in the Mikdash!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this really the hardest? Also Melikah and pouring the incense from the spoon into his hands (on Yom Kipur) are hard Avodos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, this is one of the hardest Avodos in the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> It is obvious to me that Kemitzah may be done the way people normally do this (with Chulin. They stick their fingers in from the side and press the flour in);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions (Rav Papa):</span> May one insert the fingertips and bend them back (to his palm, which is facing down?) May Kemitzah be done from the side (of the Kli? Alternatively - he puts the back of the hand into the flour, and moves it sideways so flour enters inside.) May it be done from below to above? (Rashi - he inserts the fingertips and bends them back to his palm, which is facing up; Tosfos - he inserts the palm and bends his hand, until it closes.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>These questions are not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> It is obvious to me that Chafinah (filling the hands with Ketores on Yom Kipur) may be done the way people normally do this (with Chulin. They stick their hands in from two sides and bring them together);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions (Rav Papa):</span> May one insert the fingertips to take the (double) handful? May Chafinah be done from the side (of the Kli? Alternatively - he allows the Ketores to enter his hand from between his fingers.) If he took each handful by itself and brought his hands together, is this valid?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>These questions are not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If he stuck the Kometz on the wall of the (second) Kli, does this Mekadesh it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If we require only the inside of the Kli, it is valid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Hanachah (placing it in the Kli) is required, this is not considered Hanachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>This question is not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> If he turned the Kli upside down and stuck the Kometz in (a pocket in) the bottom of the Kli, is this Mekadesh it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If we require only Hanachah inside the Kli, it is valid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it must be done normally, it is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>This question is not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>EXTRA OR MISSING OIL OR LEVONAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> How is Kemitzah done?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He bends back the middle three fingers until the palm.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If its (the Minchah's) oil is too much or Chaser, or if its Levonah is Chaser, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the case of taking too much oil?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> He designated two Lugim (instead of one, and mixed them in).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he say that he mixed in oil of Chulin or of another Minchah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Mixing in oil of Chulin or of another Minchah is not Posel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Zutra bar Tuvya):</span> If so, too much oil could not disqualify Minchas Chotei (but we know that it can)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It does not have any oil of its own, and we suggested that oil of Chulin or of another Minchah is not Posel!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a bigger Chidush when he designated two Lugim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Not only oil of Chulin or of another Minchah is Posel, rather, even if he designated two Lugim, and each is proper for the Minchah, it is Posel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Elazar's source for this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> A difficulty in the Mishnah forced him to say this:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should have said 'if there is too much oil.' Why did it say 'if its oil is too much'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that even if the oil designated for it was too much, i.e. he designated two Lugim, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If its Levonah is Chaser (it is Pasul).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Yehudah):</span> If the Levonah became Chaser and only one grain of Levonah remains, it is Pasul. If two sticks remain, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>R. Shimon says, if one stick remains, it is Kosher; if less remains, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> If any of the Kometz or Levonah is missing, it is Pasul. (This is not like either Tana!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Beraisa #2 should say 'if any of the Koret of Levonah is missing (i.e. less than one full stick remains), it is Pasul.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Beraisa #1 discusses Levonah brought with a Minchah. Beraisa #2 discusses Levonah brought by itself for a Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> Beraisa #2 is like R. Meir (the Tana of our Stam Mishnah). He argues with R. Yehudah and R. Shimon:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>All agree that initially, a Kometz of Levonah is required;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir holds that a Kometz of Levonah must remain. R. Yehudah holds that two sticks must remain, and R. Shimon holds that one stick must remain.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>All expound the same verse - "v'Es Kol ha'Levonah Asher Al ha'Minchah";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Meir says, all the Levonah that was fixed (required) from the beginning must remain;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, "Kol" teaches that it suffices for one stick to remain. "V'Es" requires a second stick;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>R. Shimon expounds "Kol" the same way, but he does not expound "v'Es".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> They argue about Levonah brought with a Minchah, but all agree that when Levonah is brought by itself, a Kometz must be brought and remain;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah and R. Shimon learn from "Asher Al ha'Minchah" - this law (that it suffices for one or two sticks to remain) applies only to Levonah that accompanies a Minchah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>LEVONAH BROUGHT WITHOUT A MINCHAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> They argue about Levonah brought with a Minchah, but all agree that Lechem ha'Panim must be accompanied by two Kamatzim, and two Kamatzim must remain.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious! (A Mishnah (106b) requires two Kamatzim. The source to be Machshir when less remains was "Kol". This was written only regarding Levonah with a Minchah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that since they are brought with the Lechem ha'Panim, they are like Levonah brought with a Minchah. R. Yitzchak teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ami or R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> They argue about Levonah brought with a Minchah, but all agree that when Levonah is brought by itself, a Kometz must be brought and remain;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(The other of R. Ami and R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> They argue about both of these.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If its Levonah is Chaser, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If there is too much Levonah, it is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If there is too much Levonah, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Rami bar Chama):</span> In the Beraisa, he designated two Kamatzim (this is too much. It is Posel.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (Rami bar Chama):</span> In the Mishnah, he designated two Kamatzim (neither is Nikva (determined) that it must be brought with it, so it is Kosher.) (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> If he designated two Kamatzim and one was lost before Kemitzah, they were not Nikva'im. (It is not considered Chaser. It is Kosher);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one was lost after Kemitzah, they were Nikva'im. (It is Chaser; it is Pasul.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> If four Kamatzim were designated for Lechem ha'Panim, two for each spoon, and two were lost before the Levonah was removed, they were not Nikva'im (it is Kosher);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they were lost after removing the Levonah, they were Nikva'im (it is Pasul).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he need to teach this? It follows from his previous teaching!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that since the Levonah is clearly distinct from the Lechem ha'Panim, once it is time to remove it, it is as if was removed. Rami teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>INTENTIONS THAT DISQUALIFY MENACHOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In the following cases, a Minchah is Pasul, but there is no Kares (for eating the Shirayim):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Kemitzah was done with intent to eat the Shirayim or a k'Zayis of the Shirayim Chutz (li'Mkomo, i.e. outside the Azarah), or to be Maktir its Kometz or a k'Zayis of its Kometz b'Chutz, or to be Maktir the Levonah b'Chutz;</p></div>
