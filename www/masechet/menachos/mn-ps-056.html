<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Ravina):</span> This answers for R. Yehudah, who says that Se'ir Nachshon required Semichah. How can we answer for R. Shimon?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Tavi):</span> This does not answer even for R. Yehudah. We learned only that Se'ir Nachshon required Semichah. This does not suggest that it required Tzafon!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If "Oso" did not exclude this, we would learn it from a Binyan Av (from Chata'os of Doros that apply to all generations).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, we would not need a verse to teach about Semichah. We would learn it from the Binyan Av!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We must say that we do not learn (Semichah for Korbanos of Chanukas ha'Mishkan) from permanent Korbanos (i.e. that apply to all generations). The same applies to Tzafon! (Our Sugya appears also in Zevachim 48b. There, b:1 is called a Beraisa. Sefas Emes suggests that it is not really a Beraisa, for the Gemara refutes it (Oso is not needed to teach about Se'ir Nachshon). Alternatively, it is a Beraisa. It is like R. Shimon, who indeed learns Semichah regarding Se'ir Nachshon from permanent Korbanos, and needs "Oso" to exclude Tzafon. This is unlike Ravina.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "Oso" teaches that the Shechitah (i.e. the animal) must be in Tzafon, but the slaughterer need not be in Tzafon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We learn that from R. Achiya!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Achiya) Question:</span> What do we learn from "v'Shachat Oso Al Yerech ha'Mizbe'ach Tzafonah"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We know that Kabalah (of Kodshei Kodoshim) and the Mekabel must be in Tzafon. If the Mekabel was in the south it is Pasul. One might have thought that the same applies to Shechitah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"V'Shachat Oso..." teaches that the Shechitah must be in Tzafon, the Shochet (one who slaughters) need not be in Tzafon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> "Oso" teaches that (an Olah must be slaughtered in Tzafon, but) Melikah need not be in Tzafon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that Melikah requires Tzafon!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Torah does not require a Kohen to slaughter a Seh (a Zar is Kosher), yet it requires Tzafon (for an Olah). The Torah requires a Kohen for Melikah, all the more so it should require Tzafon!</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We cannot learn from an Olah, for it requires a Kli (for the Kabalah and Shechitah; Tosfos - both need a Kli Shares), but Melikah does not! (Sefas Emes - the 'rejections' of this and the coming Beraisa are according to the Tana R. Achiya.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> "Oso" teaches that Olah must be slaughtered in Tzafon, but Korban Pesach need not be.</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Torah did not fix a time to slaughter an Olah (of Nedavah), yet it requires Tzafon. The Torah fixed a time for Korban Pesach (the afternoon of Erev Pesach). All the more so it should require Tzafon!</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We would have learned a Kal va'Chomer from Chatas.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Achiya does not come to exclude that the Shochet need not be in Tzafon. Rather, he says as follows. The Shochet need not be in Tzafon, but the Mekabel must be.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>LIABILITY FOR STEPS IN THE BAKING PROCESS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One is liable for (every step, for) kneading, arranging the loaves and for baking.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If he baked, he is liable twice, for arranging and for baking. (Rashi - baking is the culmination of arranging; Tosfos - some arranging is (almost inevitably) done at the time of baking.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa (55b) said that baking is a single step. One is liable for it by itself!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer:</span> Rav Papa discusses when different people arranged and baked. In the Beraisa, one person did both. (We cannot obligate him twice for arranging.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Answer:</span> Rav Papa discusses when Reuven baked and also arranged (a bit). In the Beraisa, he did not arrange at all. (E.g. Shimon put the dough in a cold oven, and Reuven ignited it.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MAKING A MUM IN A BA'AL MUM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a Bechor had too much blood, we may let blood only from a place where the wound will not be considered a Mum (blemish);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chachamim say, we may let blood even from a place that will cause a Mum. (This disqualifies it from being offered. It will be eaten like Chulin);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, one may not slaughter the animal until it develops another Mum. (This is a decree, lest people let blood when there is no need.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Shimon says, one may slaughter it based on this Mum;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">56b----------------------------------------56b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, we may not let blood even if this is the only way to save its life.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> (Even though Tana'im argue about making a Mum in a Ba'al Mum,) all agree that one is liable for Mechametz (fermenting) after Mechametz, for it says "Lo Se'aseh Chametz" and "Lo Se'afeh Chametz." (We learned from these that one is liable for every step);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>All agree that one is liable for Mesares (castrating) after Mesares - "u'Ma'uch v'Chasus v'Nasuk v'Charus." (The verse discusses Mumim of castration. It ends "...uv'Artzechem Lo Sa'asu.")</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one is liable for Kores (disconnecting the testicles), all the more so for Nosek (Tosfos - totally cutting them off, but they are still in the sac; Rashi - removing them from the sac! Why did the Torah need to say "v'Nasuk"?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that one is liable for Nosek after Kores.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>They argue only about making a Mum in a Ba'al Mum;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir obligates for this - "Kol Mum Lo Yihyeh Bo";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim exempt - "Tamim Yihyeh l'Ratzon." (Since a Ba'al Mum cannot be offered l'Ratzon, the Lav of making a Mum does not apply.)</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It excludes a Ba'al Mum from the beginning (before it became Kodesh).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Such an animal has no Kedushas ha'Guf (to be offered. Obviously the Lav does not apply!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, it excludes Pesulei ha'Mukdashim (blemished Korbanos) after redemption;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Since one may not work with or shear Pesulei ha'Mukdashim, one might have thought that the prohibition to blemish them also remains. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Kol Mum Lo Yihyeh Bo" forbids directly making (Yehayei) a Mum;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to forbid causing a Mum, e.g. sticking food to the ear? (This incites dogs to eat the food, and they cut the ear.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It could have said only 'Mum'. "Kol Mum" is extra to include this.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>FOOD THAT COOKED OR FERMENTED BY ITSELF</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> If Reuven put Se'or on a dough and it fermented by itself, he is liable, just like for Melachah on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One is exempt for such Melachah on Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> If one left meat over coals (on Shabbos) and turned over the meat, he is liable. If he did not turn it over, he is exempt.</p></div>
