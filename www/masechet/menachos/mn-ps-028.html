<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Contradiction 4:b (27b) - Rava):</span> Both Beraisos are like Chachamim. Beraisa #2 is Machshir when the Kohen was facing west (towards the Ohel Mo'ed, even if the Haza'os were not towards the Ohel Mo'ed). Beraisa #1 is Posel when the Kohen was facing north or south.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 (from above)):</span> If Haza'os inside or of a Metzora were Lo Lishmah, they are Pesulos. If they were (Lishmah but) not facing the Ohel Mo'ed, they are Kesheros.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #3):</span> If Haza'os (of a Metzora) were Lo Lishmah or not facing the Ohel Mo'ed, they are Kesheros.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> Beraisa #1 is R. Eliezer, and Beraisa #3 is Chachamim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer equates Asham to Chatas (it is Pasul Lo Lishmah), and the same applies to Log Asham (the oil). Chachamim do not equate Asham to Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Eliezer uses a Hekesh to equate Asham with Chatas. He cannot learn from another Hekesh to Log Asham! (In Kodshim, something learned from a Hekesh cannot teach through another Hekesh.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Both Beraisos are like Chachamim. Beraisa #3 is Machshir the Korban. Beraisa #1 teaches that the Metzora was not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THINGS THAT ARE ME'AKEV EACH OTHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The seven branches of the Menorah are Me'akev each other. The seven lamps are Me'akev each other;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The two Parshiyos in a Mezuzah are Me'akev each other. Even one Kesav (this will be explained) is Me'akev;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The four Parshiyos in Tefilin are Me'akev each other. Even one Kesav is Me'akev;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The four Tzitzis (sets of strings on each of the four corners of a garment) are Me'akev each other, because they are all one Mitzvah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yishmael says, each of the four is a Mitzvah by itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Question: What is the source (that seven branches are Me'akev)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says 'Havayah' (being).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE MENORAH MUST BE MIKSHAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Menorah was made Mikshah (from one piece), of gold;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was made from pieces it is Pasul. If it was made from other metals it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Presumably, a Menorah made from pieces is Pasul because it says 'Mikshah" and 'Havayah';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Likewise, a Menorah of other metals should be Pasul, for it says "Zahav" and 'Havayah'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Te'aseh" includes other metals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it includes a Menorah made from pieces!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This cannot be, for 'Havayah' refers to "Mikshah". (It is written closer to Mikshah than to Zahav.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Te'aseh" refers to "Mikshah" (it should include even from pieces!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Mikshah" twice, to show that this is Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says also "Zahav" twice. Also this should be Me'akev!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The way we expound is reasonable. The repetition of "Mikshah" teaches that one piece is Me'akev. The repetition of "Zahav" teaches other laws (below);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If gold were Me'akev and Mikshah were not, what would we learn from the repetitions of "Zahav" and "Mikshah"? (Really, we ask only about the repetition of Mikshah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Indeed, a Beraisa expounds them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Kikar Zahav Tahor Ya'aseh Osah Es Kol ha'Kelim ha'Eleh" - the weight (of the Menorah and its Kelim) must be a Kikar only if the Menorah is made of gold (which is l'Chatchilah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Gevi'eha Kaftoreha u'Fracheha" - the Menorah must have (forms of) cups, buttons and flowers only if it is made of gold.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Menorah must have branches only if it is made of gold!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Without branches, it is called a Pamut (candlestick), and not a Menorah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>"V'Zeh Ma'aseh ha'Menorah Mikshah Zahav" - the Menorah must be made from one piece only if it is made of gold.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is another "Mikshah". What do we learn from it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It excludes trumpets (they may be made from pieces);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The trumpets were made from a chunk of silver. If they were made from pieces, they are Kesherim. If they were from other metals, they are Pesulim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Presumably, a trumpet made from other metals is Pasul because it says 'Kesef" and 'Havayah';</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Likewise, a trumpet of pieces should be Pasul, for it says "Mikshah" and 'Havayah'!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding the Menorah it says "Mikshah Hi." It must be Mikshah, but trumpets need not be.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> All the Kelim that Moshe made were Kosher for his time and for all generations;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">28b----------------------------------------28b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>The only exception is the trumpets. They were Kosher for his time but not for all generations.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why were the trumpets different?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We expound "Aseh Lecha" -  make for yourself, not for generations.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, we should similarly expound "v'Asisa Lecha Aron Etz" - for yourself, but not for generations! (Griz - according to the opinion that the broken Luchos were kept it, it was for all generations.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rather, there are two opinions how to expound that "Lecha". One explains 'make them from your own money.' The other explains that Hash-m said 'I would prefer your Aron (for generations) to that of Bnei Yisrael.' (However, the Aron for the Mishkan must come from the Nedavos of all of Yisrael.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Culmination of question:</span> We should similarly expound "Lecha" regarding trumpets!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Lecha" is repeated regarding trumpets ("v'Hayu Lecha"), therefore we expound it to exclude future generations.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHAT MAY THE MENORAH BE MADE FROM?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa brei d'Rav Chanin - Beraisa #1):</span> The Menorah was made Mikshah, of gold;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rebbi says, if it was made of silver it is Kosher. If it is from tin, lead or copper, it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah is Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If it was made of wood, bone or glass, all agree that it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> How do you explain the argument?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> Both Tana'im expound Klal (a general term) u'Frat (and a specific term) u'Chlal:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah is Machshir anything like the Prat (gold), i.e. any metal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rebbi is Machshir what is like the Prat, i.e. silver, which is also important.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> There is a mistake in your Beraisa. Rather, adopt my Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - Rebbi):</span> If a Kli Shares was made of wood it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah is Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi expounds Klal u'Frat u'Chlal, and R. Yosi expounds Ribuy and Mi'ut (inclusions and exclusions);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rebbi holds that "v'Asisa Menorah" is a Klal. "Zahav Tahor" is a Prat. "Te'aseh ha'Menorah" is another Klal. We include everything like the Prat, i.e. metal;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Yosi holds that "v'Asisa Menorah" is a Ribuy. "Zahav Tahor" is a Mi'ut. "Te'aseh ha'Menorah" is another Ribuy;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>The Ribuy includes everything. The Mi'ut excludes only one thing, i.e. earthenware Kelim. (They are lowly, and not at all like the Prat.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> No, you should adopt my Beraisa in place of yours! (Rashba - perhaps your Beraisa discusses other Kli Shares, but the Klal Prat u'Klal disqualifies a wooden Menorah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> No. Other Beraisos supports my Beraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #3):</span> If there was no gold to make the Menorah, it may be made of silver; copper, iron, tin or lead;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah is Machshir even wood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #4):</span> One may not build a house the same size (dimensions) of the Heichal, nor an Achsadra (a room open on one side) the size of the Ulam, nor a Chatzer the size of Azarah, nor a table the size of the Shulchan, nor a candelabra like the Menorah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>One may make a candelabra of five, six, or eight branches. Seven is forbidden, even from metals other than gold;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah forbids seven even from wood. The Chashmona'im (who were very poor) made a wooden Menorah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> No. They made a Menorah with shafts of iron covered with tin. When they became richer, they made a silver Menorah. When they became richer, they made one of gold.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Menorah was 18 Tefachim tall;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The base was three Tefachim. The third Tefach was (in the shape of) a flower. Above this were two smooth Tefachim (without design);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The next Tefach had (shapes of) a cup, button and flower (Rashi - each occupied a third of the circumference. Tosfos connotes that they were one above the other);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The next two Tefachim were smooth. The next Tefach was like a button, with two branches emitting from it, one projecting outwards to each side, and up to the height of the Menorah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The next Tefach was smooth, then a Tefach button, with two branches coming out (up to the height of the Menorah);</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The cups were like those of Alexandria (long and narrow). The buttons were like apples of Karti (Rambam - egg shaped). The flowers were like those sculpted on pillars.</p></div>
