<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'Alai Olah', he must offer it in the Mikdash;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he offered it in Beis Chonyo (a place in Alexandria where certain Kohanim would offer (Tosfos - Korbanos of Nochrim) to Hash-m - this will be explained more on Amud B), he was not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he said 'Alai Olah (on condition) that I will offer (it) in Beis Chonyo', he must offer it in the Mikdash;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he offered it in Beis Chonyo, he was Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says, it is not an Olah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If one said 'I am a Nazir', he must be Megale'ach (bring Korbanos Nazir upon finishing Nezirus) in the Mikdash. (Megale'ach literally means 'shave', but this is done outside the Mikdash.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he was Megale'ach in Beis Chonyo, he was not Yotzei;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If he said 'I am a Nazir, (on condition that) I will be Megale'ach in Beis Chonyo', he must be Megale'ach in the Mikdash;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he was Megale'ach in Beis Chonyo, he was Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Shimon says, he is not a Nazir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why was he Yotzei? (A Korban slaughtered outside the Mikdash is Pasul.) it is as if it was killed (and not slaughtered)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Hamnuna):</span> It is as if he said 'Alai Olah on condition that I will have no Acharayus (obligation to bring another Korban if the animal I will be Makdish is lost or disqualified.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Seifa):</span> If one said 'I am a Nazir, I will be Megale'ach in Beis Chonyo', he must be Megale'ach in the Mikdash. If he was Megale'ach in Beis Chonyo, he was Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>You cannot say that it is as if he said 'I am a Nazir on condition that I will have no Acharayus for Korbanos Nazir.' Until a Nazir brings Korbanos, the prohibitions of Nezirus apply to him!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> One who vows on condition to offer in Beis Chonyo does not intend for a real Korban, rather, a mere 'gift' to Hash-m. He is willing to offer in Beis Chonyo. He does not obligate himself to more exertion than this (e.g. to offer in the Mikdash. The case is, he is closer to Beis Chonyo than to the Mikdash.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> Similarly, one who accepts Nezirus on condition to be Megale'ach in Beis Chonyo does not intend for real Nezirus, rather, just to afflict himself. He does not accept more than to (Rambam - accept the prohibitions of Nezirus until he will) be Megale'ach in Beis Chonyo. (If he were permitted to drink wine, this would be like R. Shimon!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos Kesuvos 56a DH Harei):</span> Similarly, a stipulation to be Megale'ach in Beis Chonyo shows a limit to how much he accepts to exert himself:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he is Megale'ach in the Mikdash, he was indeed a Nazir. If not, this reveals retroactively that he never accepted Nezirus!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (to Question (h), on behalf of Rav Hamnuna):</span> Indeed, the case of Kabalas (pseudo-)Nezirus is like Rava says. However, the Reisha is a vow to bring a proper Olah without Acharayus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>R. Yochanan agrees with Rav Hamnuna:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah, citing R. Yochanan):</span> If one said 'Alai Olah (on condition) that I will offer (it) in Beis Chonyo', and he offered it (outside the Mikdash) in Eretz Yisrael, he was Yotzei. He is Chayav Kares (for Shechutei Chutz, for it is a real Korban).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan and Rav Hamnuna - Beraisa):</span> If one said 'Alai Olah (on condition) that I will offer (it) in the Midbar', and he offered it in Ever ha'Yarden, he was Yotzei, and he is Chayav Kares.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>KOHANIM THAT SERVED IDOLATRY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kohanim that served in Beis Chonyo are disqualified from Avodah in the Mikdash in Yerushalayim (Tosfos, citing Rashi - but such service does not disqualify from Avodah in the Mikdash in Nov or Giv'on);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We need not say that another matter (idolatry) disqualifies;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> If a Kohen slaughtered to idolatry, his Korban (i.e. what he (later) offers to Hash-m) is acceptable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi):</span> He learns from "Ya'an AsherYesharsu Osam Lifnei Giluleihem v'Hayu l'Veis Yisrael l'Michshol Avon...V'Lo Yigshu Elai Lechahen Li" - a Kohen is disqualified only for Sherus (special Avodah) of idolatry, slaughter is not considered Sherus (because even Chulin is slaughtered, or because Zarim may</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If a Kohen was Zorek to idolatry b'Shogeg, his Korban is acceptable;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Chiper ha'Kohen Al ha'Nefesh ha'Shogeges b'Cheta'ah bi'Shgagah" - this teaches that a Kohen can (bring the Korban to) atone for his sin (of idolatry).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did he sin?</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>(Mishnah):...All the more so another matter (idolatry) disqualifies.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Beis Chonyo is not idolatry. Our Mishnah is like R. Yehudah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> One year (after Yom Kipur), Shimon ha'Tzadik (correctly) predicted that he would die that year.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">People:</span> How do you know?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Shimon ha'Tzadik:</span> Every Yom Kipur I used to see the form of an elder dressed in white. He would enter and exit the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim with me. This year, I saw an elder dressed in black. He entered with me, but did not leave with me.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>After Sukos, he fell sick for seven days, and died. Kohanim ceased to use Hash-m's name in Birkas Kohanim. (Tosfos Sotah 38A (Harei) - this was because they no longer merited Giluy Shechinah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>At the time he died, he commanded that his son Chonyo be the next Kohen Gadol. Chonyo's older brother Shim'i was jealous.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Shim'i told Chonyo 'I will teach you how to serve (Tosfos - on the day of your inauguration).' He put two extra garments on him, and stood him near the Mizbe'ach. He told the other Kohanim that the garments were of Chonyo's beloved (Rashi - wife; Rambam - harlot), he had vowed to her to wear them on his first day of Avodas Kohen Gadol. They chased after Chonyo to kill him. He fled to Alexandria and built a Mizbe'ach and offered to idolatry.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Chachamim observed, how much one can be overcome with jealousy for a position he never held, all the more so one who held it (should not be demoted, lest he ruin himself)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> No. What happened was, Chonyo insisted that his older brother Shim'i be the Kohen Gadol, but later he became jealous.</p></div>

He stood him near the Mizbe'ach with extra garments, and told the other Kohanim that Shim'i was fulfilling his vow to his beloved. They sought to kill Shim'i. He explained what happened, and (after verifying his story) they chased after Chonyo to kill him. He fled to the king's house. Everyone who saw him would tell the pursuers. He fled to Alexandria and built a Mizbe'ach and offered (Tosfos - Korbanos of Nochrim) l'Shem Hash-m - "ba'Yom ha'Hu Yihyeh Mizbe'ach la'Shem b'Soch Eretz Mitzrayim..."</p></div>

(Tosfos - according to this text, this teaching should be earlier in the Gemara.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Beraisa - R.
