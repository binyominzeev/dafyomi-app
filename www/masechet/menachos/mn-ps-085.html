<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>FROM WHERE WE BRING <i>BIKURIM</i> AND <i>MENACHOS</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can R. Yochanan answer? (He says that such Bikurim are not Kodesh!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about this. (He holds like the following Tana);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One brings Bikurim without Kri'ah for produce that grew on the roof or in a Churvah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One does not bring Bikurim (at all) from produce of an Atzitz or a boat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All Menachos must come from choice grain (...the next best place is Aforayim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>When Moshe (first) performed wonders in Mitzrayim, two of the most expert witches remarked 'do you bring straw (to sell) to Aforayim?!' (It is already full of grain. Likewise, Mitzrayim is already full of witchcraft.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Moshe:</span> One goes to the vegetable market to sell vegetables (all the buyers go there! Aruch - he answered the fools according to their folly. Ultimately, all would see that their witchcraft was no match for Hash-m's wonders.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PLANTING FOR THE <i>OMER</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not bring the Omer (Tosfos - or other Menachos) from the following:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis ha'Zevalim (a field that needs to be fertilized. Perhaps it will not be fertilized enough. Alternatively, it ruins the taste of the produce), Beis ha'Shelachin (a field that must be irrigated. Perhaps it will not be irrigated enough) or a tree field (the shade is bad for grain. Alternatively, the trees nurture from the soil, which weakens the grain);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it was brought from one of them, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>To bring the Omer, the first year it is Nir (plowed and left fallow), and in the second year, it is planted 70 days before Pesach, it produces much Soles.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>To check if the Soles was sifted enough, the Gizbar inserts his hand. If (flour) dust sticks to it it is Pasul until it is sifted again.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If it became wormy, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>(Gemara - Mishnah):... The first year it is Nir....</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we understand the Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Possibility #1:</span> The first year it is Nir and in the second year, and (in the second year) it is planted 70 days before Pesach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Possibility #2:</span> The first year it is Nir. In the second year we do not plow. We just plant it 70 days before Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Rashi) - Answer (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> Even wheat of Karziyim and Kefar Achim would have been used (for Menachos) had they <i>not</i> been close to Yerushalayim. (They were between the mountains, sothey did not get enough sun);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi Kesav Yad) - Answer (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> Even (barley of) Chiti Karziyim (a place) and Kefar Achim would have been used (for the Omer) had they been close to Yerushalayim. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We only use well-plowed, southern fields, for the sun shines on them from morning to evening (in winter, when we must grow the Omer. Alternatively, winter is the best time to grow wheat for other Menachos. Tosfos - the fields are inclined, and the bottom points to the south; Rashi - they are in the south of Eretz Yisrael.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The first year it is Nir, the second year we plow and replow and plant 70 days before Pesach, just before the sun starts getting stronger.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The stalk grows a Zeres (the distance between the pinky and thumb, this is two or three Tefachim). The ears grow two Zeretim. It is harvested, piled up, threshed, winnowed, selected, ground, sifted, and brought to the Gizbar;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The Gizbar inserts his hand. If dust sticks to it, he tells them to sift it again;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Noson says, the Gizbar anoints his hand with oil and inserts it (to check it well). As long as dust sticks to it, he keeps telling them to sift it again, until all the dust is removed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of answer:</span> It says that in the second year we plow and replow.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> In any case, this is unlike the Mishnah! (The Mishnah says that we plow at most once in the second year!)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">85b----------------------------------------85b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses a field that was worked the previous year (Shitah Mekubetzes - two years ago), so it is enough to plow once this year). The Beraisa discusses a field that was not worked the previous year (Shitah - two years ago), so it must be plowed twice this year.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the conclusion? (Shitah - the Gemara is not confident about the above answer.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> One year half the field is Nir, and the other half is worked. The next (and every subsequent) year we switch the worked and Nir halves. (There is no need to plow in the year it is worked.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> We bring the Omer only from southern fields, for the sun shines on them from morning to evening.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>A Beraisa supports this. (Shitah Mekubetzes deletes this, for the above Beraisa already supports R. Yochanan (according to Version #2).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Aba Sha'ul):</span> The Omer used to come from the valley of Beis Mikleh. It was the size in which three Sa'im are planted (Rashi - it was big enough to grow the three Sa'im needed for the Omer);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is southern. The sun shines on it from morning until evening. Half the field is Nir, and half is worked.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>R. Chilkiya bar Tuvya had a piece of land. Each year he alternated. Half was Nir, and half was worked. The field produced twice as much as a normal field that size. He sold the wheat for fine flour.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WORMY WHEAT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it became wormy, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Soles was mostly wormy, it is Pasul. If wheat was mostly wormy, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Does this mean that most of each wheat kernel was wormy, or most of the kernels were (at least partially) wormy?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>This question is not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If one was Makdish wormy Soles (for a Minchah), is he lashed for being Makdish a Ba'al Mum?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since it is Pasul, this is like being Makdish a Ba'al Mum;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps the Lav applies only to animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>This question is not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any wood in which a worm is found is Pasul for the Ma'arachah (the fire on the Mizbe'ach).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> This is only if it is wet. If it is dry, we may scrape off the wormy part.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If one was Makdish wormy wood, is he lashed for being Makdish a Ba'al Mum?</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE BEST PLACE FOR OIL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Teko'a is the best place for oil;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Aba Sha'ul says, next best is Regev in Ever ha'Yarden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Any place is Kosher, just these are the best.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>We do not use (for Menachos) olives from Beis ha'Zevalim, Beis ha'Shelachin, or from trees growing amidst other crops. If they were used, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>We do not bring use Anfeknon (oil made from unripe olives); if it was used, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>We do not use olives (that fell and became) soaked in water, or that were pickled or cooked (alternatively - that do not give oil until they are soaked, pickled or cooked). If they were used, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> "Va'Yishlach Yo'av Teko'ah va'Yikach mi'Sham Ishah Chachamah" - why did he send to Teko'a? (Maharsha - it does not say that he sent for 'Ishah Chachamah mi'Teko'a.' This implies that that he did not know about her from before, he just knew that Tekoa's was a good place for Chachamos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> They are used to eating olive oil, which is conducive to Chachmah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Tovel ba'Shemen Raglo" refers to the inheritance of Asher, which flows with oil like a spring;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Once, people of Ludkiyah needed oil. They sent a Nochri to buy a million Manos (100,000,000 Dinarim) of oil. He went to Yerushalayim, and was (eventually) directed to Ploni in Gush Chalav (in Asher's portion.) He found Ploni in the field digging under a tree, and asked if he has a million Manos of oil to sell.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Ploni:</span> (Yes;) please wait until I finish my work.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>After Ploni finished, he put his tools over his back and was clearing stones off the field while heading back to the city.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">The Nochri:</span> You (who act like a poor person) have a million Manos of oil to sell?! The Yehudim are ridiculing me!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>When Ploni reached the city, his slave brought hot water for him to wash his hands and feet, and oil for him to immerse them, fulfilling "V'Tovel ba'Shemen Raglo". After they ate and drank, he measured a million Manos of oil, and asked if they needed more.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">The Nochri:</span> Yes, but I do not have more money.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Ploni:</span> Take, I will come with you to collect for it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>He measured out an extra 180,000 Manos of oil, the Nochri hired every horse, mule, camel and donkey in Eretz Yisrael to carry it. When he returned, the people praised him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">The Nochri:</span> Do not praise me, rather, Ploni. I owe him another 180,000 Manos;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Ploni exemplified "Yesh Mis'asher v'Ein Kol Misroshesh v'Hon Rov' (some people have nothing and make themselves appear rich. Some have great wealth and make themselves appear poor.)</p></div>
