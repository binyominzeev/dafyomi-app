<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>GEHINOM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Chizkiyah):</span> What is the meaning of "v'Af Hasischa mi'Pi Tzar..."?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m ways are unlike those of people. People entice others (to sin), leading them from the way of life to the way of death;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Hash-m entices (to repent), to go from the way of death to the way of life - "v'Af Hasischa mi'Pi Tzar." He entices (to save) from Gehinom, which has a narrow opening, to hold in the smoke;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps all of Gehinom is narrow, just like the opening!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Hemik Hirchiv" (it is very wide).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is not for kings (i.e. Chachamim who later sinned)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Gam Hi la'Melech Huchan" (it is also for them).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps there is no wood there (to make a lasting fire)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Medurasah Esh v'Etzim Harbeh" (there is much wood).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the only reward of Torah is that it saves (those who remain righteous) from Gehinom!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Nachas Shulchanecha Malei Dashen" (you will be rewarded with a table full of nice things. The verse discusses bearing afflictions. Perhaps we learn that the same (or even more) applies to Torah, since its reward is equal to all the Mitzvos.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHO ATE THE SE'IR CHATAS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When Yom Kipur is on Shabbos... (When it was on Erev Shabbos, at night Bavliyim would eat the Se'ir Chatas raw.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> They were not really Bavliyim, they were Alexandriyim. Because Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael hate Bavliyim (because they did not return to Eretz Yisrael with Ezra), they called them Bavliyim (i.e. gluttons. Even though it is a Mitzvah to prevent Nosar, these Kohanim used to eat it raw every year, even when it could be cooked.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> They were not really Bavliyim, they were Alexandriyim. Because Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael hate Bavliyim, they called them Bavliyim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> You comforted me (I am from Bavel). May Hash-m comfort you!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>IMPROPER AVODAH OF LECHEM HA'PANIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the bread was put on the Shulchan on Shabbos and the Bazichim were put on after Shabbos and Huktar the next Shabbos, both are Pesulim. (The Bazichim are Mechusar Zeman, therefore they do not permit the bread). Pigul, Nosar and Tamei cannot apply to the bread (for it was never permitted);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The same applies if the bread and Bazichim were put on on Shabbos and the Bazichim were Huktar the next day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The same applies if the bread and Bazichim were put on after Shabbos and the Bazichim were Huktar the next Shabbos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, they should leave the bread (and Bazichim) on the Shulchan until the next Shabbos, for no Pesul comes from leaving it on the Shulchan for many days (Rashi - until after the second Shabbos; Aruch - i.e. a year.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah):</span> The appointee told them to see if it is time (light enough) for Shechitah. When it is time, the lookout says 'Barkai (is it light)!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Matasya ben Shmuel (the appointee) would ask him '(is the sky lit up) until Chevron?' He would answer 'yes'.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was this necessary?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Once, the moon rose and they mistook its light for daylight. They slaughtered the Tamid (and then they realized their mistake. It was Pasul, and) it was burned in Beis ha'Sereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>(On Yom Kipur,) when he said 'Barkai' the Kohen Gadol would immerse.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(The Mishnah gives another law of preparation for Avodah.) A rule for Avodah in the Mikdash is that one who defecates must immerse. One who urinates must Mekadesh (wash his hands and feet from the Kiyor (laver)).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avin's father - Beraisa):</span> Not only the Tamid, but even Melikas Olas ha'Of or Kemitzas Minchah at night is (Pasul, and it is) burned in Beis ha'Sereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, if Melikah was Pasul, it cannot be fixed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, why is the Minchah Pasul? We can return the Kometz and do Kemitzah again during the day!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Avin's father):</span> Klei Shares are Mekadesh even at the wrong time. (Since this Kometz became Kodesh, a second Kometz cannot be taken.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Anything offered during the day becomes Kodesh (if put in a Kli Shares) during the day. Anything offered at (even) night (such as Minchas Nesachim) becomes Kodesh during the day or night.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Anything offered during the day becomes Kodesh during the day, but not at night!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It does not become Kodesh to be offered, but it becomes Kodesh to be Nifsal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira - Mishnah):</span> If the bread and Bazichim were put on after Shabbos and the Bazichim were Huktar the next Shabbos, it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, they should leave the bread on the Shulchan until the next Shabbos, for no Pesul comes from leaving it on the Shulchan for many days.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If Klei Shares are Mekadesh at the wrong time, the bread should become Pasul (due to Linah) after Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> This is a good question. However, R. Avin's father cited a Beraisa! (We cannot say that it wrong. We must strive to find an answer.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (h) - Rabah):</span> (Really, Klei Shares are not Mekadesh at the wrong time.) The Tana holds that night is not considered Mechusar Zeman, but days (i.e. Lechem ha'Panim put on the Shulchan on Motzei Shabbos, six days too early) is considered Mechusar Zeman.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">100b----------------------------------------100b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In any case, when Shabbos night comes, it should become Kodesh (it is now the proper day, just it is night instead of day. We said that this is not Mechusar Zeman) to become Pasul (at the end of the coming Shabbos night, for it was on the Shulchan for seven full days! This is based on the text of Tzon Kodoshim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> The case is, the bread was removed from the Shulchan before (the first) Shabbos night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi or Mar Zutra):</span> Even if the bread was left on the Shulchan on Shabbos night, it does not become Kodesh then. Since it did not become Kodesh when placed on the Shulchan, it is as if a monkey put it on. (It does not become Kodesh until the proper time.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>IS BAKING DOCHEH YOM TOV?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Shtei ha'Lechem are eaten on Shavu'os. This is never before the second day (from when they were baked), and never later than the third day;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they were baked on Erev Shavu'os (it was not Shabbos), they are eaten on the second day. If (they were baked on the day before that because) Erev Shavu'os was Shabbos, they are eaten on the third day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Lechem ha'Panim is never eaten before the ninth day, and never later than the 11th day;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they were baked on Erev Shabbos (it was not Yom Tov), they are eaten on the following Shabbos, which is the ninth day. If (they were baked on Thursday because) Erev Shabbos was Yom Tov), they are eaten on the 10th day. (If they were baked on Wednesday because) Rosh Hashanah was on Thursday and Friday), they are eaten on the 11th day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>(Rashi - if the first day of Rosh Hashanah was Thursday, the following Shabbos is Yom Kipur, they are eaten the following night, but this is considered the 11th day, for regarding Kodshim the night is a continuation of the previous day. Tosfos - if Thursday was Mekudash to be Rosh Hashanah, the next day is Chol (mid'Oraisa). Fresh Lechem ha'Panim would be baked on Friday! The Mishnah discusses when Thursday was not Mekudash to be Rosh Hashanah (but we could not bake the Lechem ha'Panim before Minchah, lest witnesses would come and the day would be Mekudash retroactively, and there is a decree not to do Melachah after Minchah). The bread baked on Wednesday is eaten the next Shabbos, which is Erev Yom Kipur.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The baking is not Docheh Shabbos or Yom Tov;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, the baking is Docheh (a regular) Yom Tov, but not Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Ravina):</span> Do not say that the opinion that forbids offering Nedarim and Nedavos on Yom Tov agrees that it is permitted mid'Oraisa, but Chachamim forbade this lest people delay bringing them until Yom Tov. (It is improper to leave Melachah to be done on Yom Tov. Alternatively, we are concerned lest they not offer it within the required time, and transgress 'Bal Te'acher');</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, it is forbidden mid'Oraisa, like we find regarding the baking of Shtei ha'Lechem and Lechem ha'Panim. The first Tana forbids it on Yom Tov. We cannot say that this is a decree lest one delay baking them!</p></div>
<div class="perekline"><p>PEREK HA'MENACHOS VEHA'NESACHIM</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>WHICH KODSHIM MAY BE REDEEMED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Menachos and Nesachim became Teme'im before they were Mekudashos in a Kli Shares, they can be redeemed;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If they became Teme'im after Kidush, they cannot be redeemed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Birds, wood, Levonah and Klei Shares cannot be redeemed ((R. Gershom - even) after becoming Tamei - Shitah Mekubetzes deletes this from the text), for redemption (of Kedushas ha'Guf, to be offered) applies only to animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Shmuel):</span> Menachos and Nesachim may be redeemed before Kidush in a Kli Shares even if they are Tehorim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Until Kidush Kli, they are considered Kedushas Damim (only its value is Kodesh), which may be redeemed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If they became Teme'im they can be redeemed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even if they are Tehorim, they can be redeemed. The Mishnah discussed Teme'im for parallel structure to the Seifa. If they became Teme'im after Kidush, they cannot be redeemed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Seifa is obvious. Kedushas ha'Guf may not be redeemed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must teach it. One might have thought that since a Ba'al Mum is called 'Tamei', Tamei Kodshim are like a Ba'al Mum:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even though a Zevach has Kedushas ha'Guf, it may be redeemed through a Mum. The same should apply to Tamei Kodshim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Seifa teaches that this is not so. The Torah does not compare a Ba'al Mum to Tamei Kodshim after Kidush, for the latter may not be redeemed.</p></div>
