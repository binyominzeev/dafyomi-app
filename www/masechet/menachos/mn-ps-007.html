<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>RETURNING THE KEMITZAH TO THE KLI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even before the Kometz was put in another Kli it cannot be fixed, for when it is returned to the first Kli, that is Mekadesh it, and this completes the Avodah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> (These Tana'im allow returning it.) This teaches that a Kli Shares is Mekadesh what is put inside it only if the person intended for this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan holds that a Kli Shares is not Mekadesh what is put inside, even if the person intended for this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> Are Klei Shares Mekadesh Pesulim to be offered on the Mizbe'ach l'Chatchilah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> They are not Mekadesh Pesulim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan answered that Klei Shares are not Mekadesh Pesulim to be offered l'Chatchilah. They are Mekadesh them to become (irrevocably) Pesulim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Amram):</span> The Kometz is returned to an overflowing Kli (it rests on the Minchah. It does not reenter the interior of the Kli, therefore the Kli is not Mekadesh it), and repeats Kemitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Kemitzah must be taken from the interior of the Kli! (If it was overflowing, in any case the first Kemitzah was Pasul!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Kli was full but not overflowing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Removal of the Kometz left a pit. When the Kometz is returned, it reenters the pit, in the interior of the Kli!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Kometz is not returned to the pit, rather, on the wall of the Kli. The Kli is shaken, and the Kometz reenters the pit by itself. It is as if a monkey put it in. (Therefore, the Kli is not Mekadesh it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Why didn't Rav Amram say that it was returned to a Kli on the ground?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> This shows that Kemitzah from a Kli on the ground is valid.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>KEMITZAH FROM A KLI ON THE GROUND</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> Rav Nachman already asked about this:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Avimi was learning Menachos in Rav Chisda's residence...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> How can that be? Rav Chisda was a Talmid of Avimi! (The following episode proves this.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> Avimi struck (or embarrassed) me greatly for forgetting the resolution of the auction of Beis Din;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>(The Mishnah says, Beis Din announces orphans' property for 30 days before selling it; the Beraisa says, for 60 days!)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> If Beis Din announces the property for sale every weekday. They wait 30 days (before selling it). If they announce it only on Mondays and Thursdays, they wait 60 days.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Avimi had forgotten Maseches Menachos. He went to Rav Chisda, who helped him to recover it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He could have told his Talmid to come to him!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Avimi went, so that the exertion (and embarrassment of going to his Talmid) would be a merit to succeed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>On the way, Rav Nachman saw him and asked 'how is Kemitzah done?'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Avimi:</span> From this Kli that is in front of us.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> May Kemitzah be done from a Kli on the ground?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Avimi:</span> No, the Kohen lifts it up.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> How do we Mekadesh the Minchah (Rashi - the Kometz)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Avimi:</span> We put it in this Kli that is in front of us.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> May it be put in a Kli on the ground?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><p><span class="cl">Avimi:</span> No, the Kohen lifts it up.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> If so, three Kohanim are needed for Kemitzah! One lifts the Kli holding the Minchah, one does Kemitzah, and one is Mekadesh the Minchah (R. Gershom; based on our text; Rashi - lifts the Kli into which the Kometz will be put).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">15.</span><p><span class="cl">Avimi:</span> That is not difficult. The Tamid requires 13 Kohanim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> The general rule is, if any of the following Avodos was done with intent to eat something normally eaten...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Kemitzah, putting the Kometz in a Kli, Holachah, and Haktarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Mishnah does not mention lifting the Kli!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah lists the Avodos (in which Pigul applies). It does not listt all the Kohanim involved in the Avodos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May Kemitzah be done from a Kli on the ground?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> We learn (that it may) from what is done inside (the Heichal);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Four Kohanim enter, two are holding Lechem ha'Panim (each holds a stack of six loaves), each of the other two holds a spoon of Levonah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Four Kohanim enter before them. Two of them remove (last week's) Lechem ha'Panim from the Shulchan, and the other two remove the two spoons of Levonah.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Mishnah does not mention Kohanim who lift the Shulchan! (Lechem ha'Panim may be removed and placed on it when it is on the ground. Likewise, Kemitzah may be done from a Kli on the ground.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We can answer here like we said above! (The Mishnah lists the Avodos. It does not list all the Kohanim involved.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is wrong. That Mishnah did not count the Kohanim involved, but our Mishnah does. If Kohanim must lift the Shulchan, it would count them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Kemitzah may be done from a Kli on the ground.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Surely, Kemitzah may be done from a Kli on the ground, just like removal of Levonah from the Shulchan;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Surely, the Minchah may be put in a Kli Shares (to be Mekadesh it on the ground, just like placing of Levonah on the Shulchan);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> May the Kometz be put in a Kli Shares on the ground?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Do we learn from a Minchah (that it may), or from blood (a Kohen must hold the Kli for Kabalah off the ground)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We learn from blood.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>KIDUSH L'CHATZA'IM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava contradicts what he said elsewhere!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If a Kometz was put into two Kelim (part in each), it is not Mekudash;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It is Mekudash.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rava should learn from blood (that it is not Mekudash. We will explain how we know this), like he did to settle the previous question!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava retracted from this latter law. We learn from blood, it is not Mekudash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Rava was sure that) if blood was put into two Kelim, it is not Mekudash. What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from the following;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Tachlifa ben Sha'ul):</span> If Kidush Mei Chatas (putting ashes of the Parah Adumah on water) was done l'Chetz'aim (it was done in two Kelim, neither had the Shi'ur needed for Haza'ah), the water is not Kadosh (even if he puts it together and now has a Shi'ur).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the law regarding blood? (E.g. less than the amount needed for the Haza'os of Metzora or inner Chata'os was put in the Kli.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If a tradition from Sinai teaches that Kidush Mei Chatas cannot be done l'Chetz'aim, we do not learn to other places;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If we learn from "v'Toval ba'Mayim (there must be the proper Shi'ur of water to immerse the branches and sprinkle), we should learn similarly from "v'Toval... ba'Dam"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zerika citing R. Elazar):</span> Even blood is not Mekudash l'Chatza'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rava - Beraisa):</span> "V'Toval" - he immerses (his finger in blood). He does not soak up blood from the wall of the Kli;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>"Ba'Dam" - there must be enough blood for Tevilah from the beginning.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>"Min ha'Dam" - from the blood we are dealing with (this will be explained).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>The Torah must teach both "v'Toval" and "ba'Dam":</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Had it said only "v'Toval", one might have thought we do not require enough blood for all seven Tevilos from the beginning;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Had it said only "ba'Dam", one might have thought that he may soak up blood.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>BLOOD LEFT ON THE FINGER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that "Min ha'Dam" refers to the blood we are dealing with. What does this exclude?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> This excludes blood left on his finger after every Haza'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This supports R. Elazar, who says that blood left on his finger is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravin bar Rav Ada - Beraisa):</span> If blood splashed onto a garment from a Kohen's hand before he was Mazeh, it must be washed (in the Mikdash);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If blood splashed from his hand after Haza'ah, it need not be washed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Beraisa distinguishes between before and after finishing all the Haza'os. This teaches that until then, blood left on his finger is Kosher for remaining Haza'os!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> No, it distinguishes between before a Haza'ah, and (blood left on his finger) after Haza'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> After finishing Haza'ah (of blood of the Parah Adumah), the Kohen would wipe his hand on the Parah itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He would not wipe it until completing the Haza'os. (Before this, blood left on his finger is Kosher for remaining Haza'os!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> No. After completing the Haza'os, he would wipe his hand, after each Haza'ah, he would wipe his finger.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, after completing the Haza'os, he would wipe his hand on the Parah itself - "v'Saraf Es ha'Parah l'Einav" (Rashi - for he near the Parah when it is burned; Tosfos - the end of this verse requires burning all the blood with the Parah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Between Haza'os, what would he wipe his finger on? (Rashi - he was on top of Har ha'Mishchah. The Parah was below. Surely he did not descend between Haza'os! Tosfos - he could not wipe it on the Parah, lest hairs stick to his finger, which would disqualify future Haza'os.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> He would wipe his hand on the edge of the bucket (of blood) - the buckets are called "Kefori Zahav" (the root of this word also connotes cleaning).</p></div>
