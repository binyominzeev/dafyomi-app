<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PROPERTY THAT FALLS TO A WOMAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question 2:f, 38a - Abaye):</span> In the Reisha, the property fell after she fell to Yibum. In the Seifa, it fell when she was still married.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Regarding property that falls to her,) Abaye holds that her husband's Yad (power to acquire) is like her Yad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If the property fell to her when she was married, all agree that his Yad is stronger than hers!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rava):</span> Rather, in both cases, the property fell after she fell to Yibum. In the Reisha, no Ma'amar was given. In the Seifa, a Ma'amar was given.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava holds that Beis Shamai hold that Ma'amar makes Vadai Kidushin and Safek Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It makes Vadai Kidushin to exempt the Tzarah, and Safek Nisu'in to split her property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Elazar holds like Rava. R. Yosi bar Chanina holds like Abaye.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Elazar disagrees with Rava!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Beis Shamai says that a Ma'amar acquires only to exempt the Tzarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We must switch the opinions (R. Elazar holds like Abaye and R. Yosi bar Chanina holds like Rava).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The opinions need not be switched.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer said only that Ma'amar does not fully acquire, to say that if he divorces her, Chalitzah is also required; he did not say that it does not acquire to share her property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Scrutiny shows that the Mishnah is like Abaye, but it is difficult why it discusses the case in which she died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Property that enters and leaves with her' suggests property that enters her husband's Reshus, and leaves to return to the father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah discuss who gets the property itself after her death? It could discuss who eats the Peros during her lifetime!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> There can be no rebuttal of this.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>YIBUM</i> MAKES HER HIS WIFE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he does Yibum, she is like his wife in all respects...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> He may divorce her with a Get and remarry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously he may divorce her with a Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it says "He will take her as a wife and do Yibum to her", one might have thought that she is still considered a Yevamah, and he expels her through Chalitzah, and not with a Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously, he may remarry her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he did the Mitzvah incumbent on him, and now the Isur of Eshes Ach applies to her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we say so?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He will take her as a wife" - once he takes her, she is like a wife in all respects.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Her Kesuvah is paid from the property of the deceased.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>This is because Shamayim gave her to the Yavam (he did not choose to put a lien on his property in order to marry her).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the deceased did not leave enough property for a Kesuvah, Chachamim enacted that she has a Kesuvah from the Yavam, so divorcing her will not be trifling matter to him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE <i>MITZVAH</i> IS INCUMBENT ON THE OLDEST BROTHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Mitzvah is for the oldest brother to do Yibum. If he does not want, we see if the other brothers want. If they don't, we tell the oldest 'it is your Mitzvah. Do Chalitzah or Yibum.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he says that we should wait for a (minor) brother to grow up, or for the oldest brother to return from overseas, or for a deaf or insane brother to do Yibum, we do not hearken. We tell him to do Chalitzah or Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Version #1:</span> R. Yochanan and R. Yehoshua ben Levi argued about which is preferred, Yibum of a younger brother or Chalitzah of the oldest.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1:</span> Yibum of the younger is preferred, because the Mitzvah is to do Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2:</span> Chalitzah of the oldest is better, for Yibum of a younger brother when there is an older brother is not the Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Opinion #1 - Mishnah):</span> If the oldest does not want, we ask the others...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The oldest did not want to do Yibum, rather Chalitzah. We prefer that a younger brother do Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, he did not want to do Yibum nor Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Presumably, this is like 'if they do not want'. If also that means that they did not want to do Yibum nor Chalitzah, why do we force the oldest? We should force a younger brother!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the Mitzvah is on the oldest, we force him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Opinion #1 - Mishnah):</span> If the oldest says to wait for a brother to grow up, we do not hearken.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Yibum of a younger brother is preferred, we should wait. Perhaps he will do Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Seifa):</span> ...Or for the oldest brother to return from overseas (we do not hearken).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If we always prefer the older brother, we should wait for him. Perhaps he will return and do (Yibum or) Chalitzah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> You must say that we do not delay the Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">39b----------------------------------------39b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Both agree that Yibum of a younger brother is preferred. R. Yochanan and R. Yehoshua ben Levi argue about Chalitzah of the oldest and of a younger brother. One says that Chalitzah of the oldest is preferred; the other says that they are equivalent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1:</span> Chalitzah of the older is preferred, because the Mitzvah is on him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2:</span> This is only regarding Yibum. Regarding Chalitzah, they are equivalent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Opinion #1 - Mishnah):</span> If they did not want, we return to the oldest....</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They did not want to do Yibum, rather Chalitzah, and we prefer that the oldest do Chalitzah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, they did not want to do Yibum nor Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we must say that also the oldest did not want to do either. Why do we force him? We should force a younger brother!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the Mitzvah is on the oldest, we force him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Opinion #1 - Mishnah):</span> If the oldest says to wait for the oldest to return from overseas, we do not hearken.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Chalitzah of the oldest is preferred, we should wait. Perhaps he will do Chalitzah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Why don't we wait for a minor to grow up? Perhaps he will do Yibum (all agree that this is better)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> You must say that we do not delay the Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHICH IS PREFERRED - <i>YIBUM</i> OR <i>CHALITZAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Mitzvah of Yibum is preferable to the Mitzvah of Chalitzah. This was initially, when people intended for the Mitzvah. Now that people do not intend for the Mitzvah, Chalitzah is preferable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> We do not force (rather, he decides).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>When a Yavam and Yevamah would come in front of Rav, he would tell the Yavam 'It is your choice. Do Chalitzah or Yibum.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"If he does not want" - if he wants, he may do Chalitzah or Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Also Rav Yehudah holds that we do not force.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Yehudah enacted to write in a document of Chalitzah 'The Yavam and Yevamah came... it became known to us... we told him 'If you want, do Yibum. If not, stick out your right foot... she took his shoe off, and she spit at him. Beis Din saw the spit on the ground.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Chiya bar Avya says, Rav Yehudah concludes 'We read what is written in the Torah'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rav Acha and Ravina argue about if 'It became known to us' must be through witnesses, or even through a relative or a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Halachah is, this is a mere Giluy Milsa (a matter such that knowledge of it is not limited to people who witnessed a certain event), so a relative or woman suffices.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Initially, Yibum took precedence. Now that people do not intend for the Mitzvah, Chalitzah takes precedence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> They returned to say that Yibum takes precedence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Did the generations improve?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Initially, they (the majority of Chachamim) held like Aba Sha'ul. Later, they held like the Chachamim who argue with him:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Aba Sha'ul):</span> If one did Yibum for (her) beauty, or to be known as a married man, or for another reason (other than the Mitzvah), it is as if he transgressed Arayos. In my eyes, the child is nearly a Mamzer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say "Yevamah Yavo Aleha" - for any motivation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Yevamah Yavo Aleha" - (l'Shem) Mitzvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Initially, she was permitted to Shimon. She became forbidden (when she married his brother Reuven), and became permitted again (when Reuven died);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps she returns to her initial Heter!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Yevamah Yavo Aleha"- (l'Shem) Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yitzchak bar Avdimi):</span> It is Aba Sha'ul. The Beraisa says as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Yevamah Yavo Aleha"- l'Shem Mitzvah. Initially, she was permitted to him - he could marry her for beauty, or for the sake of marriage. She became forbidden, and became permitted again;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps she returns to her initial Heter!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Yevamah Yavo Aleha"- (l'Shem) Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Beraisa can be like Chachamim. "Yevamah Yavo Aleha"- Mitzvah. Initially, she was permitted to him - he could marry her or not. She became forbidden, and became permitted again;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps she returns to her initial Heter, and he marries her only if he wants!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, he may not choose not to marry (or do anything else to) her. She is tied to him (to do Yibum or Chalitzah), can she leave him without anything?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, perhaps he may do Yibum or Chalitzah, whichever he prefers!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Yevamah Yavo Aleha"- (this is the) Mitzvah.</p>
