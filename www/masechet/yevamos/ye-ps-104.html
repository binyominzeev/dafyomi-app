<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SHOES INVALID FOR <i>CHALITZAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a shoe was offered to idolatry or is of an Ir ha'Nidachas (a city condemned because its majority served idolatry), or is for a Chacham's honor, it may not be used. If it was used, the Chalitzah is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Chalitzah with a shoe for a Chacham's honor is invalid because it was not made for walking. The same should apply to the shoe of Beis Din (for Chalitzah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> If a messenger of Beis Din would walk in it, the judge would not mind (therefore it is considered made for walking).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>CHALITZAH</i> AT NIGHT OR WITH THE LEFT FOOT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Chalitzah was done at night, it is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Elazar says, it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Chalitzah was done with the left foot, it is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Elazar says, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Suggestion:</span> R. Elazar equates conflicts (in Beis Din, which includes Chalitzah) to Tzara'as (rulings about it must be done by day), and Chachamim do not equate them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. All agree that we do not equate them. If we did, even a final verdict could not be at night!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rather, R. Elazar holds that Chalitzah is like the beginning of judgment (which must be during the day), and Chachamim hold that it is like the end of judgment (which may be at night).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rabah bar Chiya Ketosfa'ah oversaw a Chalitzah with a felt shoe, without other judges, at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Shmuel (sarcastically):</span> He is so great, to follow an individual's opinion!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did Shmuel object to?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We cannot say that he objected to using a felt shoe, for a Stam Beraisa permits this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We cannot say that he objected to Chalitzah at night, for our Stam Mishnah says that it is valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He objected to Chalitzah without other judges. An individual permits this:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Chalitzah was done with two judges, or with three and one was found to be a relative or invalid, the Chalitzah is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon and R. Yochanan ha'Sandlar say, it is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It once occurred that a Yavam and Yevamah did Chalitzah by themselves in jail. R. Akiva said, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef bar Minyomi):</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Shimon and R. Yochanan ha'Sandlar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> All three aspects of the Chalitzah were like an individual's opinion:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> I saw R. Yishmael ben Elisha oversee a Chalitzah with a felt shoe, without other judges, at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Chalitzah was done with the left foot ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Chachamim invalidate this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> They learn a Gezeirah Shavah "Regel-Regel" from a Metzora.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like there, we need (to put blood and oil on) the right foot, also for Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Elazar should also learn this Gezeirah Shavah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> We pierce the right ear of an Eved Ivri who wants to remain a slave - it says "Ozen" regarding the slave and regarding a Metzora.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like we put blood and oil on the right ear of a Metzora, the right ear of the slave is pierced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> The opinions (in the Mishnah) should be reversed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> We need not switch the opinions. R. Elazar learns from "Ozen-Ozen" because the words are extra (they are only for the Gezeirah Shavah). He does not learn from "Regel-Regel" because these words are not free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if they are not extra, he should learn unless there is a reason not to!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We have a reason not to learn. Taharas Metzora requires cedar wood, hyssop and scarlet wool (and therefore, the Torah requires the right foot). Chalitzah does not require these, so perhaps the Torah does not require the right foot!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IS RECITING THE VERSES ESSENTIAL?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she took off his shoe and spat, but did not recite the verses, the Chalitzah is valid. If she recited and spat but did not take off the shoe, it is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Eliezer says, if she took off his shoe and recited, but did not spit, the Chalitzah is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Akiva says, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">104b----------------------------------------104b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> "So will be done" - every action is Me'akev (essential for Chalitzah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> "So will be done to the man" - (only) actions to the Yavam are essential.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If the Yavam or Yevamah was deaf (i.e. a deaf-mute), or he was a minor, the Chalitzah is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If she was a minor, she does Chalitzah again when she becomes an adult. If not, the Chalitzah was invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If Chalitzah was done with two judges, or with three and one was found to be a relative or invalid, the Chalitzah is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Shimon and R. Yochanan ha'Sandlar say, it is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It once occurred that a Yavam and Yevamah did Chalitzah by themselves in jail. R. Akiva said that it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Version #1 - Rava):</span> Since reciting the verses is not Me'akev, even if he or she is mute, the Chalitzah is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If he or she was deaf, or he was a minor, the Chalitzah is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is invalid because they cannot recite the verses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is because they lack understanding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the same should apply if he or she is mute!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> A mute person has knowledge, just his mouth cannot speak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> D'Vei R. Yanai taught that (when he or she is deaf) it is invalid because he or she cannot recite the verses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, we must say that Rava taught about the Seifa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Mishnah):</span> If he or she was deaf, or he was a minor, the Chalitzah is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Since reciting the verses is Me'akev, if he or she is mute, the Chalitzah is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>The Mishnah says that reciting is not Me'akev (if he and she can speak). This is like R. Zeira:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> If a Minchah is small enough to be mixed, it is valid even if it was not mixed. If it is too big to be mixed (one Log of oil cannot be mixed with more than 60 Esronim of flour. Alternatively, the Keli is too small) it is invalid because it was not mixed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A <i>YEVAMAH</i> WHO SPAT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rabanan (to Shmuel's father):</span> If a Yevamah spat (at her Yavam), she must do Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Spitting disqualifies her from doing Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to which Tana is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is like R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is plausible to compare spitting to Eimurim (parts of a Korban burned on the Mizbe'ach). When the Eimurim are not around, offering them is not Me'akev (requisite for) eating the meat, but when they are around, they are Me'akev (one may not eat the meat before offering them);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva does not equate them, and says that failure to spit does not invalidate the Chalitzah (even though it is possible). Surely, spitting alone does not forbid doing Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, it is like R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> He holds that two things permit her (removing the shoe and spitting). In such a case, one does not permit without the other!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> It is like Rebbi:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> The two loaves brought on Shavu'os become Kodesh only through Shechitah of the lambs offered with them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Shechitah and Zerikah (throwing the blood on the Mizbe'ach) of the lambs was done Lishman (intending for the Mitzvah), the loaves become Kodesh. If Shechitah was Lo Lishma and Zerikah was Lishman, the loaves are not Kodesh. If Shechitah was Lishmah but Zerikah was not Lishman, the loaves are Kodesh and not Kodesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon says, they are not Kodesh unless the Shechitah and the Zerikah were li'Shman.</p>
