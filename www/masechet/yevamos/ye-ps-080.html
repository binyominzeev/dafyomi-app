<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHO IS A SERIS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a Seris Chamah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> It is one who was a Seris from birth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that he was a Seris from birth?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> When he urinates, it does not make an arch.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What causes a man to be a Seris Chamah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His mother baked in the heat of the afternoon, and drank mixed (some say - strong) beer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I had heard my mother say, 'Anyone who was stricken from birth'. Now I know what she referred to.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest he got better in the interim (and if he was once fertile, Yibum and Chalitzah apply to him)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he was and is a Seris at the beginning and the end, we are not concerned lest he was better in the middle.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mari - Beraisa - R. Chanina ben Antigonus):</span> We check (a firstborn animal with a blemished eye) three times within 80 days. (We are concerned lest it improved in the middle!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are concerned that one limb recovered in between, but not that the entire body did.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> No, rather (a Seris Chamah does Chalitzah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah - Beis Hillel):</span> If a 20-year old man did not bring two hairs, he proves that he is 20, and (that) he is a Seris. He does not do Chalitzah or Yibum;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a 20-year old woman did not bring two hairs, she proves that he is 20, and (that) she is an Ailonis. She does not do Chalitzah or Yibum;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Shamai says, the age for both of them is 18;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Eliezer says like Beis Hillel (20) for a man and like Beis Shamai (18) for a woman, since women mature faster.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rami bar Dikuli):</span> R. Eliezer retracted his opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which did he retract?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> A Seris Chamah does Chalitzah and Chalitzah is done to his wife, because in Alexandria they have a cure for this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Elazar):</span> R. Eliezer did not retract. The Mishnah (of 18 and 20 years) discusses when they are considered adults to be punished for sins.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN DOES A SERIS BECOME AN ADULT?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one ate Chelev between the age of 12 and 18, then brought Simanim of being a Seris, and later brought hairs, (s)he becomes an adult retroactively. (Rashi, Tosfos - we discuss a female; Ramban - we discuss a male.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> (S)he was a minor when (s)he ate.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> (R. Meir says that there is no fine for raping or enticing a minor.) According to Rav, R. Meir should say that there is a fine for an Ailonis (since retroactively she was a Na'arah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> No, she jumps from being a minor to a Bogeres. She was never a Na'arah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I should merit that such teachings be said in my name!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> A Seris cannot become a Ben Sorer u'Moreh (a rebellious son), because Ben Sorer u'Moreh applies after he brings hairs below. The laws of Na'arah Me'orasah do not apply to an Ailonis, since she jumps from being a minor to a Bogeres.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> One with signs of being a Seris or Ailonis is not considered an adult until 20. Until 20 years we do not consider a baby born after eight months of pregnancy (to be alive - Rashi; Nimukei Yosef - to be an adult).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> An eight-month baby cannot live!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> An eight-month baby is like a rock. One may not move him on Shabbos, but his mother may bend down to let him nurse, because of danger (to both of them).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">80b----------------------------------------80b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, there are Simanim that he is viable:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is an eight-month baby?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is one who was not in the womb the proper time;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rebbi):</span> There are Simanim of this. His hair and nails are unfinished;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If they are finished, we assume that he is a seven-month baby that delayed a month before being born.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A case occurred, and a woman gave birth 12 months after her husband went overseas. Rabah Tosfa'ah ruled that the child is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Is this like Rebbi, who says that a baby may delay in the womb (unlike Chachamim)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel agrees, so they are like a majority.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> Any child that lives 30 days is viable. (Even if he was born in the eighth month, we say that he was a seven-month baby that came out late).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Any male who did not bring two hairs within 20 years is a Seris Chamah, even if he brings hairs later. The (other) Simanim are:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He has no beard;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>His hair is soft;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>His skin is smooth;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, his urine does not foam;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Some say, when he urinates it does not make an arch;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Some say, his semen is watery;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>Some say, his urine does not putrefy;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>Others say, when he bathes in winter his body does not give off steam;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, his voice is stricken, and one cannot discern his gender from it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>Any female who did not bring two hairs within 20 years is an Ailonis, even if she brings hairs later. The Simanim are:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>She has no breasts;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Bi'ah is painful for her;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, she does not have curved hips.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, her voice is deep, and one cannot discern her gender from it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> One must have all the Simanim of a Seris to be a Seris.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One of them suffices.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When he has two hairs in the beard, all agree that he is a Seris only if he has all the Simanim. They argue when he lacks two hairs in the beard.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rabah bar Avuha said 'Check Rav Nachman. If he gives off steam when he bathes, I will marry my daughter to him.' Was this like Rav Huna?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is even like R. Yochanan. Rav Nachman had patches of hair in the beard.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SEIFA IS LIKE R. AKIVA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Seris does not do Chalitzah or Yibum. Also, an Ailonis ...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Mishnah discusses a Seris similar to an Ailonis. Just like an Ailonis is b'Yedei Shamayim, also the Seris.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This Seifa was taught anonymously. It is like R. Akiva, who says that a Seris Adam does Chalitzah, but a Seris b'Yedei Shamayim does not.</p></div>
