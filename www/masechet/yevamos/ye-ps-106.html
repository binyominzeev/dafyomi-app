<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A deceived Chalitzah is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a deceived Chalitzah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> They tell him that Chalitzah will permit him to do Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yochanan - Mishnah):</span> Whether he intended but not her, or she intended but not him, the Chalitzah is invalid unless both have intention.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> They tell him that if he does Chalitzah he will receive 200 Zuz (and he does not get it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> A deceived Chalitzah is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is when they tell him that if he does Chalitzah he will receive 200 Zuz.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A case occurred in which a woman fell to an unworthy Yavam. They told him that if he does Chalitzah he will receive 200 Zuz. R. Chiya ruled that the Chalitzah is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>A Yavam and Yevamah came in front of R. Chiya bar Aba.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> R. Chiya told her to do Yibum. Her mother said that it is better that she not do Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chiya bar Aba:</span> Do you know the nature of the Yavam?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Her mother:</span> Yes. He saw that she has money, and he wants to consume it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> R. Chiya told the Yevamah to stand. Her mother said she cannot (she is an amputee, or sick).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chiya bar Aba:</span> Does the Yavam know this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Her mother:</span> Yes. He wants to do Yibum anyway because he saw that she has money, and he wants to consume it. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chiya bar Aba (to the Yevamah):</span> Do you want him?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">The Yevamah:</span> No.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chiya bar Aba (to the Yavam):</span> Do Chalitzah, and then you may do Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>After he did Chalitzah, R. Chiya bar Aba told him that she cannot do Yibum, and he should now do a proper Chalitzah that will permit her to marry a stranger.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>The daughter of Rav Papa's mother-in-law fell to an unworthy Yavam.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Do Chalitzah, and this will permit you to do Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> Don't you hold like R. Yochanan, who says that this is invalid?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> What should I tell him?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> Say that he will receive 200 Zuz for doing Chalitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>After he did Chalitzah, Abaye told her to pay the money. (In any case the Chalitzah was valid, but she must fulfill her contract.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> She was just fooling him;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A man was fleeing jail, and the ferry was in front of him. He offered the ferryman a Dinar (a large amount) to take him across. He owes only the usual fare.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>This is because he can say that he was just joking (when he offered a Dinar).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>Also here, she can say that she was just joking!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Where are your parents (who support you, enabling you to become so sharp)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> They are in the city.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Because of Abaye's envy (he was orphaned from birth), Rav Papa's parents died.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>COERCION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one was tricked into doing Chalitzah, the Chalitzah is valid. If one was tricked into giving a Get, the Get is invalid;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If one was forced to do Chalitzah, the Chalitzah is invalid. If one was forced to give a Get, the Get is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case (of being forced)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If he said 'I want (to do it)', a forced Chalitzah should also be valid!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If he did not say 'I want', a forced Get should also be invalid!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa means: if one was tricked into doing Chalitzah, the Chalitzah is always valid. If one was tricked into giving a Get, the Get is always invalid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one was forced to do Chalitzah or give a Get, sometimes it is valid, sometimes not;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is valid only if he said 'I want'.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "He will offer (the Korban)" teaches that we force him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we force him against his will!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "According to his will" - we force him until he says that he wants.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>The same applies to Gitin. We force him until he says that he consents.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava citing Rav Safra):</span> We oversee Chalitzah, even if we do not know that they are the Yavam and Yevamah. We oversee Mi'un, even if we do not recognize her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Therefore, witnesses (who saw Chalitzah or Mi'un) may not write a document of Chalitzah or Mi'un unless they recognize the people. We are concerned lest a Beis Din err. (Another Beis Din will see names in a document and assume that the supervising Beis Din verified that those people performed the Chalitzah or Mi'un.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava himself):</span> We oversee Chalitzah only if we recognize the Yavam and Yevamah. We oversee Mi'un only if we recognize her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Therefore, witnesses may write a document of Chalitzah or Mi'un even if they do not recognize them. We are not concerned lest (the supervising) Beis Din err (and not check the names).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">106b----------------------------------------106b</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE CHALITZAH RITUAL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Mitzvah of Chalitzah is as follows. The Yavam and Yevamah come to Beis Din. They give him a proper counsel - "The elders will speak to him".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>She says "My Yavam refuses to stand up seed for his brother in Yisrael; he does not want to do Yibum with me". He says "I do not want to take her" - these are said in Hebrew.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Yevamah draws close to the Yavam, in view of the judges, and removes his shoe. She spits in front of him. The judges must see the spit. She says "So will be done to the man who will not build his brother's house."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>They used to read this much. R. Hurkenus would complete the passage, and this became the custom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>"He will be called in Yisrael the house of the removed shoe" - the Mitzvah is for the judges to say this, and not the Talmidim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it is a Mitzvah on all present to say "The one whose shoe was removed".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mitzvah of Chalitzah is as follows. She reads; he reads; she removes his shoe; she spits; she reads.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he teach? The Mishnah says this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that this is only a Mitzvah l'Chatchilah. If the order was reversed, it is not a problem.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Whether she removed the shoe before spitting, or spat before removing, what she did, she did (it is valid).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> One who recites the verses (for them to repeat) should not prompt her to say "Lo" by itself and "Avah Yabme" by itself. This connotes 'No, he wants to do Yibum!'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, they should be said together - "He does not want to do Yibum with me".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>He should not prompt the Yavam to say "Lo" by itself, and "Chofatzti" by itself. This connotes 'No, I want to take her!'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, he should say at once "I do not want to take her".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This is a mere pause. We are not concerned for this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>Rav Kahana was struggling to help a Yevamah to say "Lo Avah Yabme" without pausing.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Don't you hold like Rava, that there is no problem if they pause in the middle?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Kahana:</span> Rava admits that "Lo Avah Yabme" must be said without pause. (He argues only about "Lo Chofatzti").</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> One who writes a Chalitzah document must write 'We told her to say from "My Yavam refuses" until "He does not want to do Yibum with me". We told him to say from "I do not" until "To take her". We told her to read from "so" until "the one whose shoe was removed".'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>Mar Zutra scratched a line (to help him write straightly) and wrote the entire passage.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> One may not write passages of the Torah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>The Halachah follows Mar Zutra.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE SPIT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If she spat and the wind carried the spit (away from the Yavam), it is as if she did not spit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is because we require "She will spit in front of him".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If he is tall and she is short, even if the wind carries the spit, it was in front of him. If she is tall and he is short, we require that the spit should pass in front of his face before the wind takes it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If she ate garlic or earth and spat, it is as if she did not spit.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We require that she should spit by herself (not that a food caused the saliva).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The judges must see the spit when it leaves her mouth - "She will spit, in the view of the judges."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> "His name will be called in Yisrael, the house whose shoe was removed" - the Mitzvah is for the judges to say this, not the Talmidim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> A Yevamah did Chalitzah in front of R. Tarfon - he told us all to say, "The one whose shoe was removed" three times.</p></div>
