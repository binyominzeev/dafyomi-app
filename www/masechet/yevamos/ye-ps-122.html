<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHEN WE MAY RELY ON A <i>NOCHRI</i> (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Ploni's wife heard this and came before Abaye. He required her to wait until Chachamim gather to learn Halachos of the festival.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ada bar Ahavah (to the woman):</span> Ask Rav Yosef, he is very sharp.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> The following Beraisa shows that she is not permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Nochri was selling fruit and said 'it is Orlah (within the first three years of the tree), or of Azika (a place where fruits were guarded in Shemitah), or it is fourth year produce (which must be eaten in Yerushalayim in Taharah, or redeemed)', his words have no effect, since he intended only to praise his fruit. (Similarly, this Nochri just wanted to scare the Yisrael.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Aba Yudan):</span> A case occurred in which a Yisrael and Nochri traveled together. The Nochri said 'Woe to the Yisrael who traveled with me. He died and I buried him.' Chachamim permitted his wife to remarry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>There was also a case of a company of men going to Antuchya. A Nochri said, 'Woe to this company of men. They died and I buried them.' Chachamim permitted their wives to remarry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>There was a case of 60 men going to Beitar. A Nochri said, 'Woe to the 60 men who were going to Beitar. They died and I buried them.' Chachamim permitted their wives to remarry.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MUST THE DECEASED BE SEEN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may testify if the deceased was seen by candlelight or by moonlight. We may testify based on a voice, even if no body was seen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A case occurred in which a man was on a mountain top. He gave his name and place, and said that he is dying. People went and did not find anyone. His wife was permitted to remarry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A case occurred in Tzalmon in which a man gave his name and said that he is dying from a snakebite. They were unable to identify the body. His wife was permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rabah bar Shmuel - Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> We cannot permit a woman based on a voice alone;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Beis Hillel permit this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Rabah teach this? We already know that it is permitted from our Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that if we find a Stam Beraisa that does not permit through a voice alone, it is Beis Shamai.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They went and did not find him ... (his wife was permitted).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they heard a Shed (a being that has similarities to people and to angels)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> (When he was speaking) they saw a human form.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shedim also have human forms!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He had a shadow.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shedim also have shadows!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He had a shadow of a shadow. (A Gaon says that we are not proficient about this. Pischei Teshuvah connotes that it is a shadow longer than the person's height, or a dark shadow inside a lighter shadow.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Shedim also have shadows of shadows!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina):</span> Yonasan Sheida (a Shed, or an expert about Shedim) told me that Shedim have shadows, but not shadows of shadows.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it was a Tzarah (intending that her Tzarah remarry and later be forced to leave her husband)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> At a time of danger, we may write and give a Get even if we do not recognize the husband (who commands. Here also, there is no other way to permit his wife, so we overlook this concern.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DO WE RELY ON ONE WITNESS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> When I went to Neharde'a to make a leap year, I encountered Nechemyah of Beis Deli.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Nechemyah:</span> I heard that in Eretz Yisrael, only R. Yehudah ben Bava permits a woman based on one witness.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> That is correct.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Nechemyah:</span> Tell them in my name that the roads are perilous because of soldiers; I received from R. Gamliel the Elder that a woman may remarry based on one witness.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> When I told this to R. Gamliel (the grandson of R. Gamliel the Elder), he rejoiced.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> We have found a colleague (support) for R. Yehudah ben Bava!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Gamliel recalled that men were killed in Tel Arza, and R. Gamliel [the Elder] permitted their wives based on one witness. It became established to remarry based on second hand testimony, and based on a slave or woman;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua say, a woman may not remarry based on one witness;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Akiva says, she may not remarry based on a slave or a woman or relatives.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> R. Akiva permits her to remarry based on a woman!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar citing R. Akiva):</span> A woman is believed to bring her own Get (from Chutz la'Aretz, and to testify that it was written and signed in front of her) from a Kal va'Chomer:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The women who are not believed to say that Leah's husband died (e.g. her mother-in-law - 117a) are believed to bring Leah's Get. All the more so Leah herself, who is believed to say that her husband died, is believed to bring her own Get!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Only those women are not believed to say that Leah's husband died, but other women are believed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Akiva's opinion at the end of our Mishnah was taught before it was established to remarry according to invalid witnesses. The Beraisa is after this became the practice.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They told R. Akiva about a case in which Leviyim went to Tzo'ar. One got sick, and they left him at an inn. When they returned, they asked where he is. The innkeeper said that he died, and she buried him. Based on this, they permitted his wife to remarry.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Kohenes (a Kosher woman) should be believed no less than an innkeeper!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> In a case like that of the innkeeper, she is believed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The innkeeper gave them the man's staff, bag and Sefer Torah.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">122b----------------------------------------122b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why should an innkeeper be worse than a regular woman? (They said 'a Kohenes should be believed no less than an innkeeper.')</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana and Aba brei d'Rav Minyomi's Beraisa):</span> The innkeeper was a Nochris. She spoke l'Fi Tumo, 'this is his staff and bag, and this is the grave I buried him in.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> They asked her 'where is our friend?' (so she was not l'Fi Tumo)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When she saw them, she cried even before they asked.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MUST WE INTERROGATE THE WITNESS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> Reuven came in front of R. Tarfon for Edus Ishah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Tarfon:</span> How do you know that the man died?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> We were travelling together; a troop chased us. He broke off an olive branch and chased them away. I said 'Aryeh (lion), your strength should be increased!'</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Aryeh:</span> How did you know my name? In my city, they call me Yochanan b'Rebbi Yonasan Aryeh, of the village Shichya.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> Later, he fell sick and died.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Tarfon permitted Aryeh's wife to remarry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> R. Tarfon requires interrogating the witness!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> Reuven came before R. Tarfon for Edus Ishah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Tarfon:</span> How do you know that the man died?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> We were travelling together; a troop chased us. He broke off an olive branch and chased them away. I said 'Aryeh, your strength should be increased!'</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Aryeh:</span> You guessed my name! In my city, they call me Yochanan ben Yonasan Aryeh, of the village Shichya.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> Later, he fell sick and died.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Tarfon:</span> Didn't you say Yochanan ben Yonasan of the village Shichya Aryeh?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> No, I said Yochanan ben Yonasan Aryeh, of the village Shichya.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>R. Tarfon tested Reuven two or three times. When he saw that his story was consistent, he permitted Aryeh's wife to remarry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not interrogation is required (and about R. Tarfon's opinion):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not interrogate witnesses testifying to permit a woman to remarry;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Akiva and R. Tarfon say, we interrogate them. (Almost all Meforshim had this text. Our text attributes the first opinion to R. Akiva.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Tana'im argue about R. Chanina's law.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> Mid'Oraisa, both monetary and capital cases require interrogation - "You will have one law";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Chachamim said that we do not interrogate in monetary cases, lest people be discouraged from lending money (out of fear lest the witnesses be disqualified).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The first Tana (in the Beraisa) considers Edus Ishah to be a monetary case, since she receives her Kesuvah (if we allow her to remarry);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Akiva and R. Tarfon hold, since we permit a married woman to remarry, it is like a capital case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Chachamim increase Shalom in the world - "All your children are learned of Hash-m, great is the Shalom of your children".</p></div>
