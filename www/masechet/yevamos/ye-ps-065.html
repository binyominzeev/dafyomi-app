<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A BARREN WOMAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a woman was married to a man and did not have children (in 10 years); to a second man and had no children; afterwards she may marry only a man who has children;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If she married a man without children, she leaves him without a Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If she did not have children from the third husband, may her first two husbands demand that she repay the Kesuvah she collected from them?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Can they say, 'It is now revealed that you were the barren one'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, can she say 'Now I became weak'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Presumably, the latter is true.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If she married a fourth husband and had children, may she demand a Kesuvah from the third husband?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No. We tell her, it is better for you to be quiet, lest your third husband say that had he known (that you are fertile) he would not have divorced you (and you are still married to him)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Papa):</span> If she keeps quiet, do we keep quiet? The divorce was void, and her children are Mamzerim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> Rather, we say that now she got better.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> If (Reuven and Leah did not have children in 10 years and) each of them says that the other is sterile, this is 'matters between the two of them'; she is believed (and receives a Kesuvah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>This is because she can tell whether or not his semen shoots as an arrow, but he cannot tell.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> Even if he says that he will marry another woman to prove that he can have children, he must divorce Leah and pay a Kesuvah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>I say that anyone who takes a second wife must grant his first wife a divorce and a Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A man may marry several additional wives, on condition that he can feed them.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">65b----------------------------------------65b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> If he says that she miscarried within 10 years and she denies it (so you must divorce me now), also here she is believed. Had she miscarried, she would not falsely establish herself to be barren.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>If she miscarried three times she is established to miscarry (and he must divorce her).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak ben Elazar):</span> A case occurred in which he said that she miscarried twice and she said that she miscarried three times. Rabanan believed her;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had she not miscarried three times, she would not falsely establish herself as one who miscarries.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ARE WOMEN COMMANDED TO HAVE CHILDREN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A man is commanded "Peru u'Rvu, but a woman is not;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yochanan ben Berokah says, "... Peru u'Rvu" was said to both Adam and Chavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source that only a man is commanded?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Ilai):</span> The verse continues "Fill the land and conquer it". It is normal for men to conquer (in war), but not for women.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Just the contrary! Kivshuhah (conquer it) is the plural form, connoting both!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It is written Kivshah (singular).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> (Hash-m told Yakov) "... Pere u'Rve (singular)", and not 'Peru u'Rvu' (plural).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ilai):</span> Just like it is a Mitzvah to say something that will be heeded, it is a Mitzvah not to say something that will not be heeded.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> This is an obligation - "Don't rebuke a scoffer, lest he hate you; rebuke a Chacham, and he will love you.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ilai):</span> It is permitted to deviate (from truth) for the sake of Shalom - "Your father commanded ... tell Yosef to bear the sin (of his brothers)".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Noson):</span> This is a Mitzvah - "And Shmuel said ... Sha'ul will hear (that I am going to anoint David) and he will kill me" (so Hash-m told him to say a falsehood).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael - Beraisa):</span> Shalom is so great that even Hash-m deviated (for its sake). Sarah said "And my husband is old"; Hash-m told Avraham only that she said, "And I am old".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yochanan ben Berokah says...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>One of R. Yochanan and R. Yehoshua ben Levi said that the Halachah follows R. Yochanan ben Berokah. The other said that the Halachah follows Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Decision:</span> The following shows that R. Yochanan said the Halachah follows Chachamim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> R. Avahu said in the name of R. Yochanan that the Halachah follows R. Yochanan ben Berokah; R. Ami and R. Asi turned their faces.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> R. Chiya bar Aba said so in the name of R. Yochanan, and R. Ami and R. Asi turned their faces.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Granted, in Version #1 R. Ami and R. Asi did not say anything (they merely turned their faces) due to the honor of the Kaiser's house (R. Avahu was close to them);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, according to Version #2, why didn't they refute him?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the final ruling?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A case (of a childless couple) came before R. Yochanan. He obligated the husband to divorce her and pay a Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If she is not commanded, why must he pay a Kesuvah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps she had a claim (why she needed children):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">A woman (to R. Ami):</span> Force my husband to (divorce me and) pay my Kesuvah (we are childless).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Ami:</span> No, you are not commanded to have children!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">The woman:</span> What will be in my old age (if I have no children)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Ami:</span> If this is her concern, we certainly force him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>A woman came before Rav Nachman with a similar request. When he heard that she desires a son to support her in her old age and to bury her, he replied like R. Ami.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>Yehudah and Chizkiyah were twins. One was born at the beginning of the seventh month, and the other at the end of nine months. This was very painful for Yehudis (their mother), R. Chiya's wife. She disguised herself and came before R. Chiya.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Yehudis:</span> Is a woman commanded Peru u'Rvu?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> No.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>She drank a sterility potion. When R. Chiya found out, he greatly regretted that she would not bear more children;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Yehudah and Chizkiyah were brothers; Pazi and Tavi were sisters.</p></div>
