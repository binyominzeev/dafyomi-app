<p class="dedicationbox">12th CYCLE DEDICATIONS<BR>&nbsp;<BR>YEVAMOS 16 (2 Sivan) - This Daf has been dedicated in memory of Harry Bernard Zuckerman, Baruch Hersh ben Yitzchak (and Miryam Toba), by his children and sons-in-law. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE LAW OF <i>TZARAS</i> <i>ERVAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> In the days of R. Dosa ben Harkinas, Tzaras ha'Bas was permitted to the brothers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> This proves that they followed their own teachings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> In the days of R. Dosa, Tzaras ha'Bas was permitted. Chachamim were very pained, because (they thought that he permitted it, and) he was a great Chacham but he could not come to the Beis Medrash because he was blind. Three Chachamim came to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> What is the law of Tzaras ha'Bas?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Dosa:</span> Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel argue about this. The Halachah follows Beis Hillel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> We heard in your name that the Halachah follows Beis Shamai!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">R. Dosa:</span> Did you hear this in my name, or in the name of Ben Harkinas?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> We heard only 'Ben Harkinas'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">R. Dosa:</span> It was my brother Yonasan, a student of Shamai. Beware! He has 300 proofs to permit Tzaras ha'Bas. I testify that Chagai the Navi said three laws in this place:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tzaras ha'Bas is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In Amon and Mo'av, we separate Ma'aser Oni in Shemitah (the seventh year).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We accept converts from Karduyin and Tarmudim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Yonasan encountered R. Akiva, stumped him, and insulted him. R. Akiva bore it gracefully with humility.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> In Amon and Mo'av, we separate Ma'aser Oni in Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learned that many cities were conquered by Bnei Yisrael that left Mitzrayim, but were not conquered by the exiles who returned from Bavel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The first Kedushah of Eretz Yisrael was not permanent. The returning exiles left some cities without Kedushah so they could be (farmed and) a source of food for the poor in Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ACCEPTING CONVERTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> We accept Karduyim and Tarmudim to become converts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Contradiction (Rami bar Yechezkel's Beraisa):</span> We do not accept Karduyim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> He taught that we do not accept <i>Kartuyim</i>.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like people say, that Kartuyim are Pesulim (regarding lineage).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rami bar Yechezkel - Beraisa):</span> We do not accept Kartuyim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Kartuyim and Karduyim are the same (and this contradicts Beraisa #1)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> No, they are different.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like people say, that Kartuyim are Pesulim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan and elders):</span> We do not accept converts from Tarmod.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan taught otherwise!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Stains (of blood on garments) that come from Rekem are Tehorim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says they are Tamei, because they are converts who erred. (Rashi - they abandoned Torah. Chachamim decreed that their stains are Tamei, like Dam Nidah of Yisraelim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Stains that come from Nochrim are Tehorim.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Mishnah did not specify. This implies that stains of all Nochrim are Tehorim, even from Tarmod!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This teaches that we accept converts from Tarmod (and may marry them. We are not concerned lest they are (Mamzerim) Yisraelim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan observed that the Mishnah holds that way; he himself disagrees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan taught that the Halachah follows a Stam Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Amora'im disagree about the opinion of R. Yochanan. (He taught only one of these.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason not to accept converts from Tarmod?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan or the elders):</span> (We are concerned lest they descend from) the slaves of Shlomo;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (The other of R. Yochanan and the elders):</span> (Perhaps they descend from) girls of Yerushalayim (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>We understand Answer #1. He holds that the child of a Bas Yisrael from a Nochri or slave is a Mamzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Answer #2, what was the problem with Benos Yerushalayim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah and Chachamim):</span> When the Nochrim entered the Heichal (at the time of the first Churban), most Nochrim engaged in taking gold and silver. Twelve thousand men and (or including) 6,000 archers turned to Benos Yerushalayim - "They afflicted women in Tziyon, virgins in the cities of Yehudah."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>AGADIC TEACHINGS OF R. SHMUEL BAR NACHMANI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> "I was a youth, I grew old" - this verse was said by the world minister (the angel Metatron).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m could not have said it, for He does not age;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>David could not have said it, for he did not live to be so old!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rather, the world minister must have said it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> "The afflicter spread his hand on all its treasures" refers to Amon and Mo'av;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When Nochrim entered the Heichal, all others engaged in taking gold and silver, and they turned to the Sefer Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They said 'the Torah forbids (converts from) Amon and Mo'av to marry into the congregation of Hashem' - it will be burned!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "Hash-m commanded that Yakov's enemies surround him" - such as Humniya (Yevanim), who harass Yisraelim in Fum Nahara.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SAFEK YISRAELIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a Nochri was Mekadesh a Bas Yisrael, we are concerned for this. Perhaps he is (a Yisrael) from the 10 tribes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should assume that he is from the majority of people, who are not from the 10 Shevatim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are concerned in places where they (the 10 Shevatim) settled. (Rashi - there they are 'fixed', so it is considered an even Safek. Tosfos - there, they are the majority.)</p>
