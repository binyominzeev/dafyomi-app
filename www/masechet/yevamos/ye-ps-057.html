<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CAN A WOMAN EAT TERUMAH IF SHE IS FORBIDDEN TO HER HUSBAND?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is not necessarily true!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In our Mishnah, R. Elazar and R. Shimon permit her to eat because her husband can permit other women to eat Terumah. Here, her husband (a Petzu'a Daka) cannot permit any woman to eat!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Also here, he permits a convert's daughter to eat (she may marry a Petzu'a Daka)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yochanan asked R. Oshaya this (whether or not she may eat), and he never settled it! (Tosfos - the Gemara settles this below. Rashi connotes that R. Oshaya himself never settled it, therefore we cannot use this to defend R. Oshaya.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Here also, a Petzu'a Daka permits his wife to eat, if he married her before becoming a Petzu'a Daka, and did not have Bi'ah with her after becoming a Petzu'a Daka.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> He permits his Kena'ani slaves to eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Abaye did not answer as Rava, because we learn marriage laws from marriage laws, not from laws of slaves;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Rava did not answer like Abaye, for there is different, for she already ate.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Abaye holds that the fact that she already ate is immaterial.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> If you will not say so, a Bas Yisrael widowed from a Kohen should continue to eat, because she already ate!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> There is different, since his Kinyan lapses when he dies. Here, she is still married to the Petzu'a Daka!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A PETZU'A DAKA MARRIED TO A CONVERT'S DAUGHTER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> If a Bas Ger married a Petzu'a Daka, may she eat Terumah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Oshaya was silent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Later, another great man came and asked a different matter, and R. Oshaya answered his question.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who was this great man?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was Reish Lakish.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah Nesi'ah:</span> Is R. Yochanan not a great man (why didn't you answer him)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Oshaya:</span> He asked me a question that needs no answer!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he asks according to R. Yehudah, even if a Kohen (who became a Petzu'a Daka) loses his Kedushah (special marriage Isurim), she does not eat!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he retains his Kedushah, she does not eat, since R. Yehudah says that a male convert's daughter is like a Chalal's daughter, and is forbidden to a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>(And even) if he loses his Kedushah she does not eat, since (R. Yehudah says that) converts are considered Kehal (the congregation of) Hash-m, so she may not marry a Petzu'a Daka.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he asks according to R. Yosi, even if he retains his Kedushah, she may eat!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he loses his Kedushah she may eat, since R. Yosi holds that converts are not Kehal Hash-m, so she may marry a Petzu'a Daka; (Note- we switched the order of these two lines for clarity. The Gemara's 'first' side (which we put second) also relies on 'Lo Ikri Kehal' for the Heter - see Tosfos DH d'Ha.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>(And even) if he retains his Kedushah she may eat, since R. Yosi holds that even the daughter of two converts is permitted to Kehunah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Rather, he asked according to the following Tana:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> A Bas Ger may not marry a Kohen unless her mother is a Bas Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yochanan asked whether being a Bas Yisrael's daughter adds (only) Kashrus (to Kehunah), and therefore she may eat;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Or, perhaps (also) Kedushah is added (she is called Kehal Hash-m, and is forbidden to a Petzu'a Daka), and she does not eat?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (to R. Yochanan's question - R. Acha's Beraisa):</span> We learn that a Bas Ger married to a Petzu'a Daka may eat Terumah from "When a Kohen acquires a person... he will eat";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom is this Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It is unlike R. Yehudah, who holds that even if the Kohen loses his Kedushah, she does not eat!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>It is unlike R. Yosi. He holds that even if he retains his Kedushah, she may eat, so we would not need a verse to teach this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like R. Eliezer ben Yakov. This shows that Kashrus is added, and she eats.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">57b----------------------------------------57b</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CHUPAH OF A PESULAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Yesh Chupah l'Pesulos (Chupah takes effect even if she is forbidden to him. Rashi - even though Bi'ah is Asur, Chupah makes Kidushin (like Rav Huna, Kidushin 5a). Tosfos - Rav teaches that Chupah after Kidushin disqualifies her, even without Bi'ah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Ein Chupah l'Pesulos (it does not take effect).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Rav admits regarding a girl under three years and a day. Since Bi'ah with her is not considered Bi'ah, Chupah does not take effect on her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rava- Mishnah):</span> The following apply to a girl (at least) three years and one day:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One can Mekadesh her through Bi'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>She is acquired to her Yavam through Yibum;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>One who has Bi'ah with her is liable for Eshes Ish (if she is married);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>(If she is Nidah,) one who has Bi'ah with her becomes Tamei (due to Bo'el Nidah), and he is Metamei a Mishkav (a Kli made to sit on it) under him (even if he does not touch it) to be (a Rishon l'Tum'ah,) like a Kli above a Zav;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>If she is married to a Kohen, she may eat Terumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>If a man has Bi'as Isur with her, he disqualifies her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If she is three years and one day, Bi'ah disqualifies her, so also Chupah does. If she is younger, Bi'ah does not disqualify her, so neither does Chupah.</p></div>
