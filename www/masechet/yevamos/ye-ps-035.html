<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHO MUST WAIT BEFORE MARRYING? (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Chachamim decreed that a minor must wait (after Zenus, even though she cannot be pregnant) lest an adult not wait.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do not make such decrees!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If they are minors, they return to their husbands immediately.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Gidal):</span> That was a Hora'as Sha'ah (a special ruling for an urgent need at the time).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that the case happened (but the Mishnah does not say so)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, it was like a Hora'as Sha'ah. It is not common that wives get mixed up (therefore, we did not decree).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Shmuel):</span> Any woman who had Bi'ah must wait three months before marrying someone else, except for an adult who converted or was freed from slavery. A minor Yisraelis need not wait.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of the minor?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> She did Mi'un.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Shmuel already taught that she need not wait after Mi'un!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> She was divorced.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Shmuel taught that she must wait!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If a minor did Mi'un, she need not wait three months. If he gave her a Get, she must wait.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The minor had Zenus.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Zenus is uncommon for a minor, so we do not decree due to an adult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Zenus is common for a convert or freed slave (before the conversion/freedom). We should decree!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel holds like R. Yosi:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> A girl who converted or was freed from captivity or from slavery must wait three months;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi permits her to become Mekudeshes and get married immediately. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> R. Yosi holds that a woman that has Zenus uses a wad to prevent pregnancy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Granted, a convert intended to convert, and was careful (to avoid pregnancy three months beforehand) so she would know whether her child was conceived before or after conversion;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We also understand why a captive or freed slave would be careful, if she heard from her master (that she will be freed or taken to a place where people will redeem her).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, if a slave went free because the master dismembered her tooth or eye, she did not know to be careful beforehand!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps R. Yosi agrees in such a case.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> A girl who was seduced or raped must wait three months;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Yosi permits her to become Mekudeshes or married immediately.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> R. Yosi holds that a girl who is raped turns over (after Bi'ah so the semen will fall out, to avoid pregnancy);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah is concerned lest she did not turn over well.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE WOMEN ARE DISQUALIFIED FROM TERUMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If they are Kohanos (they are disqualified from Terumah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also a Yisraelis is disqualified from Terumah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, if they were wives of Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also a Yisrael's wife is disqualified (through Bi'as Ones with another man)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Amram):</span> Rav Sheshes derived from a Mishnah (53b) that if a Yisrael's wife was raped, even though she is permitted to her husband, she is disqualified from Kehunah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Our Mishnah teaches that if they are Kohanos married to Yisraelim, they are disqualified from (returning after being widowed or divorced to eat) Terumah of their fathers' houses.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>YIBUM AND CHALITZAH OF A PREGNANT WOMAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Yevamah did Chalitzah and was found to be pregnant:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If she gives birth to a viable baby (the Chalitzah was meaningless), the Yavam may marry her relatives, she may marry his relatives, and she may marry a Kohen;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the baby is a Nefel (not viable), he is forbidden to her relatives, and she is forbidden to his relatives and to Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If a Yevamah did Yibum and was found to be pregnant:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If she gives birth to a viable baby, the Yavam must divorce her, and they must bring a Chatas;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it is a Nefel, they may remain married.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If we are unsure whether the baby was born nine months after conception from the deceased, or seven months after conception from the Yavam, the Yavam divorces her, the child has proper lineage (i.e. is not a Mamzer), and they bring Asham Taluy (for perhaps they sinned).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Yochanan):</span> If one did Chalitzah to a pregnant woman, she does not need Chalitzah from the brothers;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> She needs Chalitzah from the brothers.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Yochanan holds that Chalitzah and Yibum of a pregnant woman are valid. Reish Lakish holds that they are invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>The argument could be based on expounding verses, or on reasoning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Perhaps it is based on reasoning. R. Yochanan holds that if Eliyahu would tell us that she is pregnant with a Nefel, we would permit her to do Yibum or Chalitzah. Even though Eliyahu didn't come, when we see later that it was a Nefel, this shows that retroactively the Yibum or Chalitzah was valid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Reish Lakish holds that we do not retroactively validate it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Perhaps they argue how to expound "U'Ven <i>Ein</i> Lo". R. Yochanan says, this was fulfilled (so the Parashah of Yibum and Chalitzah applied);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Reish Lakish expounds "Ayen" (see if he will have a son).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question (R. Yochanan - Mishnah):</span> If the baby is a Nefel, he is forbidden to her relatives, and she is forbidden to his relatives and to Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is not difficult for me. Since the Chalitzah is valid, she is forbidden to his relatives and Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to you, the Chalitzah is invalid. Why is she forbidden?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> This is a stringency mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question (Reish Lakish - Mishnah):</span> If the baby is a Nefel, he is forbidden to her relatives, and she is forbidden to his relatives and to Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is not difficult for me. Since the Chalitzah is invalid, it says that she is forbidden to his relatives and Kohanim; this is a stringency. It does not say that Chalitzah is not needed from the brothers.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to R. Yochanan, it should say that she does not need Chalitzah from the brothers (and we would know that all laws of valid Chalitzah apply)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, it should! However, since the Reisha discussed the Isur of relatives, the Seifa also did. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question (R. Yochanan - Mishnah):</span> (When they did Yibum,) if the baby is a Nefel, he keeps her (as a wife).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is not difficult for me. He keeps her because the Yibum was valid!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to you, the Yibum was invalid. It should say that they do Yibum again, and he keeps her!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, when it says 'he keeps her' it means that he does Yibum again and keeps her;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Less than this (to divorce her without Chalitzah) is not sufficient.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question (Reish Lakish - Mishnah):</span> (When they did Yibum,) if the baby is a Nefel, he keeps her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is not difficult for me. Since the Yibum was invalid, he does Yibum again and keeps her. Less is insufficient.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to you, the Yibum was valid. The Mishnah should say that he may divorce or keep her!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, this is true! Since the Reisha said that he divorces her, the Seifa says that he keeps her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a woman did Yibum and was found to be pregnant, her Tzarah may not marry, lest the baby will be viable.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> To the contrary! If the baby is viable, the Tzarah is exempt from Yibum and Chalitzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> It should say... lest the baby is a Nefel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If the Yibum of a pregnant woman is valid, why can't the Tzarah marry? She is exempted through the Yibum!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> All agree that Yibum of a pregnant woman does not exempt. They argue only about Chalitzah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan says that Chalitzah of a pregnant woman is Chalitzah, but her Yibum is invalid; Reish Lakish says that both are invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> It is illogical for R. Yochanan to say so!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Yibum is valid, so is the Chalitzah! If the Yibum is invalid, so is the Chalitzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is because we hold that a woman can do Chalitzah only if she can do Yibum.</p></div>
