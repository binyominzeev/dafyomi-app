<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE CHILD OF A SLAVE OR <i>NOCHRI</i> THROUGH A <i>BAS</i> <i>YISRAEL</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> All agree that if a slave or Nochri fathered the child of a Bas Yisrael, the child is a Mamzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who admits?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Shimon ha'Temani admits. Even though he says that Mamzerim do not come from Chayavei Lavin, that refers to Chayavei Lavin who can have Kidushin with others;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A slave or Nochri cannot have Kidushin, so they are like Chayavei Kerisus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Beraisa):</span> If a slave or Nochri fathered the child of a Bas Yisrael, the child is a Mamzer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Yehudah says, a Mamzer comes only from Ervah that is Chayavei Kerisus. (Even though he holds like Shimon ha'Teimani, he disagrees!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> Rather, Rebbi admits. Rebbi said 'Only R. Akiva says this (that if Yibum was done after Chalitzah, no Get is needed), since R. Akiva considers a Chalutzah like Ervah', but Rebbi himself argues;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi admits (to R. Akiva) that the child of a Bas Yisrael from a Nochri or slave is a Mamzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi citing Rabeinu):</span> The child of a Bas Yisrael from a Nochri or slave is a Mamzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Acha redeemed captives; one was pregnant from a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> R. Yochanan, R. Elazar and R. Chanina all say that the child is a Mamzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> Does a long list of names prove that this is the Halachah?! Rav and Shmuel in Bavel, and R. Yehoshua ben Levi and Bar Kapara in Eretz Yisrael say that he is Kosher!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some say that in place of 'Bar Kapara', Rav Yosef cited 'the elders of the south'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The Halachah is, he is a Mamzer, but this is because Rebbi says so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> Rabeinu (Rebbi) says, the child is a Mamzer. R. Yehoshua ben Levi says, the child is Pagum (blemished).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To whom is the child Pagum?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot be to Yisraelim, for R. Yehoshua ben Levi said above that the child is Kosher!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he is Pagum to Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>All the Amora'im who say that the child is Kosher agree that he is blemished to Kehunah, from a Kal va'Chomer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a widow marries a Kohen Gadol, even though the Isur is not Shavah b'Chol, the child is Pagum (a Chalal). The Isur of a Nochri or slave to a Bas Yisrael is Shavah b'Chol, all the more so the child is Pagum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from there, since the widow herself becomes defiled!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here also, she becomes defiled!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a Nochri or slave had Bi'ah with a Kohenes, Leviyah or Bas Yisrael, he disqualified her. "If a Bas Kohen will be widowed or divorced (from a Yisrael, she may eat Terumah again)" applies only to someone from whom there is widowhood or divorce. Widowhood and divorce do not apply to a Nochri or slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye to Rav Yosef):</span> Why do you rely on Rav Dimi, and not on Ravin (who says that Rebbi permits)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> R. Noson and R. Yehudah ha'Nasi permit the child.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah ha'Nasi is Rebbi!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>Also Rav permits the child!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">A man:</span> What is the status of the child of a Yisraelis from a Nochri or slave?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> He is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The man asked to marry Rav's daughter; Rav refused.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Simi bar Chiya:</span> People say in Madai that a camel can dance in a tiny circle. Here they are and it is not dancing! (You should agree, to demonstrate that your ruling is correct!).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> If the man was like Yehoshua bin Nun, I would not give him my daughter! (Maharsha - perhaps he disqualifies to Kehunah, like a Chalal. This is unlike the Rashba. Me'iri - it is below my honor to give to him my daughter.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rav Simi:</span> If he was like Yehoshua Bin Nun, he could find other girls to marry. If you don't give this man your daughter, also other will not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>The man would not leave. Rav put his eyes on him, and he died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>Rav Masnah and Rav Yehudah also permitted the child.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span>When such a case came to Rav Yehudah, he would counsel the son to go to a place where he is unknown, and get married there. Alternatively, he should marry a girl of similar parentage. (Even though he is permitted, children of Yisraelim were reluctant to marry him.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CHILDREN OF A HALF-SLAVE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (People of Bei Michsi):</span> If a half-freed slave had Bi'ah with a Bas Yisrael, what is the child's status?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Even if the father was a full slave, the child is Kosher, all the more so if he was a half-slave!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">45b----------------------------------------45b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> You learn from Rav Yehudah, who rules that the son of a Bas Yisrael from a slave is Kosher. He himself says that if the father was a half-slave, the child has no solution!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yehudah said so regarding a half-slave who was Mekadesh a Bas Yisrael. His slave side has Bi'ah with a married woman (and this causes Mamzerus).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Nehardai say that the stringent opinion disqualifies the child even if the mother was single, and the lenient opinion permits even if she was married!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Both opinions learn from Eshes Av (which is written next to the Isur of Mamzer).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One opinion says, just like Mamzerus results from Eshes Av because Kidushin cannot apply to such a union, the same applies whenever the parents could not have Kidushin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The other opinion says, Mamzerus comes from Eshes Av because the father could be Mekadesh other women, but not the mother. A Nochri or slave cannot Mekadesh anyone, so his children are never Mamzerim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, R. Yehudah taught about children of a half-slave from a married woman. The free half has Bi'ah with a married woman (this makes Mamzerus).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> Rav Gaza said that R. Yosi bar Avin ruled in two cases. He permitted the child of a single girl (from a slave), and forbade the child of a married woman (from a slave).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> No, R. Yosi bar Zvida ruled, and he permitted in both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> Ameimar permitted both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The Halachah is, the son of a Nochri or slave from a Bas Yisrael is Kosher, whether or not she is married.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Rava ruled that Mari bar Rachel (whose father was a Nochri) is Kosher, and gave him a position of authority.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Put on yourselves a king" teaches that all appointments of authority must be from your brethren, and not from converts. Nevertheless, since his mother is Jewish, he is considered your brother.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>TEVILAH</i> FOR <i>TAHARAH</i> SUFFICES FOR CONVERSION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Chiya bar Ami's slave immersed a Nochris (to be Metaher her from Tum'as Nidah) because he wanted to take her for a wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I can show that she and her daughter are Kesheros:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She is Kesherah, for it is clear from Rav Asi (brought immediately below) that Tevilas Nidah suffices for conversion.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Her daughter is Kesherah, for if a Nochri or slave fathered a child from a Bas Yisrael, the child is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>People were calling a certain man the son of a Nochris.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Asi:</span> Didn't his mother immerse after being a Nidah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>People were calling a certain man the son of a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Levi:</span> Didn't his father immerse after seminal emissions?! (This suffices for conversion.)</p>
