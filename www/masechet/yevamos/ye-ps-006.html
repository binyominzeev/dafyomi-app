<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We hold that an Aseh overrides a Lav. We should learn from here that it does not!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Isurim of Shabbos are more stringent than regular Lavin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The following Tana does not distinguish!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> If a father told his son (a Kohen) to become Tamei (Mes), or not to return a lost object, perhaps he should obey!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "A man will fear his parents, and keep My Shabbosos" - you are all obliged to honor Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hechsher Mitzvah is different. (Tosfos - the Mitzvah of Kibud is giving food to a parent. Hechsherim, i.e. means to this end, do not override Lavin. Rashi - really, the father told the child to slaughter or cook. If not for the verse, this would override Shabbos, for Hechsher Mitzvah, i.e. what is inevitable for fulfillment of a Mitzvah, overrides even Kares. Transgressing Eshes Ach is not inevitable. One can do Chalitzah instead!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question #1, Daf 3b):</span> We would have learned from Binyan Beis ha'Mikdash that a Mitzvah with Kares is overridden:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Binyan Beis ha'Mikdash overrides Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Keep My Shabbosos and fear My Mikdash" - you are all obliged to honor me.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We would have thought that building and destroying are allowed, if not for the verse.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> No, the suggestion was to permit Mechamer. The verse rejects this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We hold that an Aseh overrides a Lav. We should learn from here that it does not!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Isurim of Shabbos are more stringent than regular Lavin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The following Tana does not distinguish (he learns other Isurim from Shabbos)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps if a father told his son (a Kohen) to become Tamei, or not to return a lost object, he should obey!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "A man will fear his parents, and keep My Shabbosos" - you are all obliged to honor Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Tosfos) Answer:</span> The Beraisa teaches that <i>Hechsher</i> Mitzvah does not override a Lav. (The Mitzvah, giving him to eat, is after he transgressed the Lav.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi) Rejection #2:</span> (Really, it discusses building and destroying. If not for the verse, this would override Shabbos, for) these are Hechsher Mitzvah. (In this case, one cannot fulfill Kivud Av v'Em without transgressing the Lav. We cannot learn to Yibum, which is not Hechsher Mitzvah, for one can do Chalitzah. end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learned Hechsher Mitzvah from there (honoring parents, does not override a Lav - 1:a:1)! (Rashi - why did the Torah teach also about Binyan Beis ha'Mikdash? Rather, it is to teach that even without Hechsher Mitzvah, an Aseh overrides a Lav with Kares!)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>FEAR OF THE MIKDASH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> True; our verse comes to teach the following.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps a person should fear the Mikdash!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Keep My Shabbosos and fear My Mikdash" discusses guarding Shabbos and fearing the Mikdash. We fear the One who commanded to keep Shabbos, not Shabbos itself. Similarly, we fear the One who commanded about the Mikdash, but not the Mikdash itself.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is fear of the Mikdash?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A person does not enter Har ha'Bayis with his staff, shoes, money-belt, or dust on his feet. He may not make it a shortcut; all the more so, he may not spit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this applies only when the Beis ha'Mikdash stands!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Keep My Shabbosos and fear My Mikdash" - just like observing Shabbos applies forever, also fear of the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>IS SHABBOS OVERRIDDEN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question #1):</span> We would have learned from Misas Sereifah that a Mitzvah with Kares is overridden:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael) Question:</span> What do we learn from "Do not kindle fire in all your dwellings on Shabbos"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> A Beraisa already teaches this! R. Yosi expounds that burning is only a Lav. R. Noson expounds to be Mechalek (one is liable for each Melachah of Shabbos by itself)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Clarification (Rava):</span> The Tana asks what we learn from "your dwellings".</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Since Shabbos is an obligation of people (not of the land), it applies outside of Eretz Yisrael as well. What do we learn from "in all your dwellings"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yishmael) Suggestion #1:</span> Perhaps "When a man is Chayav Misah he will be killed" applies even on Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It says "Mechalelehah (those who desecrate Shabbos) Mos Yumas"!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That would apply to Melachos other than Misas Beis Din.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion #2:</span> Or, perhaps "Mechalelehah Mos Yumas" applies even to Misas Beis Din, and "he will be killed" is only on a weekday!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion #3:</span> Or, perhaps it is even on Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Do not kindle fire in all your dwellings on Shabbos", and "... judgment... in your dwellings". Just like the latter "dwellings" refers to Beis Din, also the former, and the Torah forbids burning.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Tana holds like R. Noson, who says that the verse is Mechalek. If not for the verse, we would have said that execution overrides Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the Tana is R. Yosi. (Burning is only a Lav, therefore one might have thought that execution overrides it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even R. Yosi exempts from Kares only burning. Beis Din burns people through melting lead (and pouring it down their throats)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> Melting lead is like cooking ingredients to make dye (there is Kares for it)!</p></div>
