<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We hold that an Aseh overrides a Lav. We should learn from here that it does not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Isurim of Shabbos are more stringent than regular Lavin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The following Tana does not distinguish!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> If a father told his son (a Kohen) to become Tamei (Mes), or not to return a lost object, perhaps he should obey!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "A man will fear his parents, and keep My Shabbosos" - you are all obliged to honor Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hechsher Mitzvah is different. (Tosfos - the Mitzvah of Kibud is giving food to a parent. Hechsherim, i.e. means to this end, do not override Lavin. Rashi - Hechsher Mitzvah, i.e. what is inevitable for fulfillment of a Mitzvah, overrides even Kares. Transgressing Eshes Ach is not inevitable. One can do Chalitzah instead!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question #1, Daf 3b):</span> We would have learned from Binyan Beis ha'Mikdash that a Mitzvah with Kares is overridden:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Binyan Beis ha'Mikdash overrides Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Keep My Shabbosos and fear My Mikdash" - you are all obliged to honor me.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We would have thought that building and destroying are allowed, if not for the verse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the suggestion was to permit Mechamer. The verse rejects this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We hold that an Aseh overrides a Lav. We should learn from here that it does not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Isurim of Shabbos are more stringent than regular Lavin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The following Tana does not distinguish (he learns other Isurim from Shabbos)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps if a father told his son (a Kohen) to become Tamei, or not to return a lost object, he should obey!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Rejection "A man will fear his parents, and keep My Shabbosos" - you are all obliged to honor Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Tosfos) Answer:</span> The Beraisa teaches that <i>Hechsher</i> Mitzvah does not override a Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi) Answer:</span> (Really, the father told the child to slaughter or cook. If not for the verse, this would override Shabbos, for) these are Hechsher Mitzvah. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learned that we (Tosfos - do not) override a Lav for Hechsher Mitzvah from the verse of honoring parents (1:a:1)!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FEAR OF THE <i>MIKDASH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> True; our verse comes to teach the following.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps a person should fear the Mikdash!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Keep My Shabbosos and fear My Mikdash" discusses guarding Shabbos and fearing the Mikdash. We fear the One who commanded to keep Shabbos, not Shabbos itself. Similarly, we fear the One who commanded about the Mikdash, but not the Mikdash itself.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is fear of the Mikdash?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A person does not enter Har ha'Bayis with his staff, shoes, money-belt, or dust on his feet. He may not make it a shortcut; all the more so, he may not spit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this applies only when the Beis ha'Mikdash stands!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Keep My Shabbosos and fear My Mikdash" - just like observing Shabbos applies forever, also fear of the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IS <i>SHABBOS</i> OVERRIDDEN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question #1):</span> We would have learned from Misas Sereifah that a Mitzvah with Kares is overridden:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael) Question:</span> What do we learn from "Do not kindle fire in all your dwellings on Shabbos"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> A Beraisa already teaches this! R. Yosi expounds that burning is only a Lav. R. Noson expounds to be Mechalek (one is liable for each Melachah of Shabbos by itself)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Clarification (Rava):</span> The Tana asks what we learn from "your dwellings".</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since Shabbos is an obligation of people (not of the land), it applies outside of Eretz Yisrael as well. What do we learn from "in all your dwellings"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yishmael) Suggestion #1:</span> Perhaps "When a man is Chayav Misah he will be killed" applies even on Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It says "Mechalelehah (those who desecrate Shabbos) Mos Yumas"!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That would apply to Melachos other than Misas Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion #2:</span> Or, perhaps "Mechalelehah Mos Yumas" applies even to Misas Beis Din, and "he will be killed" is only on a weekday!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion #3:</span> Or, perhaps it is even on Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Do not kindle fire in all your dwellings on Shabbos", and "... judgment... in your dwellings". Just like the latter "dwellings" refers to Beis Din, also the former, and the Torah forbids burning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Tana holds like R. Noson, who says that the verse is Mechalek. If not for the verse, we would have said that execution overrides Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the Tana is R. Yosi. (Burning is only a Lav, therefore one might have thought that execution overrides it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even R. Yosi exempts from Kares only burning. Beis Din burns people through melting lead (and pouring it down their throats)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> Melting lead is like cooking ingredients to make dye (there is Kares for it)!</p>
