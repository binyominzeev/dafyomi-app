<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE <i>ISUR</i> OF <i>ACHOS</i> <i>ISHTO</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from Achoso. Just like one's paternal and maternal sisters are forbidden, also both sisters of one's wife are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we learn from Dodaso, that only the paternal sister is forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable to learn from Achoso, since this Isur is due to himself, just like Achos Ishto.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It is better to learn from Dodaso, for the Isur comes through Kidushin, just like Achos Ishto!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, we learn from Eshes Ach, since this Isur is due to himself and comes through Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source regarding Eshes Ach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Ervas Eshes Achicha" is forbidden, for paternal and maternal brothers.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it applies only to paternal brothers!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion #1:</span> Just like the Isur Achoso applies to paternal and maternal sisters, also here.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion #2:</span> Or, perhaps we should learn from Dodaso, and only the paternal brother is included!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Decision:</span> We should learn from the more similar case.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion #1:</span> It is better to learn from Achoso (his own relative) and not from Dodaso, who is his father's relative.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion #2:</span> Perhaps it is better to learn from Dodaso, since this also comes through Kidushin, and not from Achoso!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We include a maternal brother from "Ervas Achicha Hi" (the end of the verse; it is extra).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps only a paternal brother's wife is forbidden, and the extra verse is needed to teach, when he has children, she is forbidden in the life of his brother and after his death!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he has children, we already know that she is forbidden after he dies. Since the Torah permits Yibum when he has no children, we infer that when he has children, she is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion #1:</span> Perhaps when he has no children, she is permitted to the Yavam and forbidden to all others. When he has children, she is permitted to all!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion #2:</span> Perhaps when he has no children, Yibum is a Mitzvah. When he has children, it is optional!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion #3:</span> Perhaps when he has no children, Yibum is permitted. When he has children, it is forbidden, and the Isur is derived from a Mitzvas Aseh and is only a Chayavei Aseh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ervas Achiv Gilah (Aririm Yihyu)" (this is extra to teach about after the brother died. Aririm (having no children) alludes to Kares.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps a maternal brother's wife is like a paternal brother's wife, and is permitted after death!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "She is" - she remains forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>EXTRA MENTIONS OF <i>KARES</i> AND <i>ARIRI</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Torah mention Kares regarding a sister (all Arayos are Chayavei Kerisos)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This teaches R. Yochanan's law:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If one had Bi'ah with all the Arayos b'Shogeg, he brings a Korban for each one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yitzchak):</span> Even though one is normally lashed for Chayavei Lavin, Kares was written regarding one's sister to teach that the punishment for Chayavei Kerisus is Kares and not lashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> From where does R. Yitzchak learn R. Yochanan's law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "<i>V'El Ishah</i> b'Tum'as Nidasah", obligates for each woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Torah write regarding Dodaso "They will be childless"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer - Contradiction:</span> It says "They will be childless", and it says "They will die childless"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> If he has children (when he sinned), he will bury them; if he had no children, he will die childless.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>It was needed to write both:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had the Torah written only "They will be childless", one might have thought that children he had before sinning will die, but not children after the sin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had the Torah written only "They will die childless", one might have thought that he will not have children after the sin, but children born before the sin will not die!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>HA'ARA'AH</i> IS CONSIDERED LIKE <i>BI'AH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Ha'ara'ah is considered like Bi'ah regarding Chayavei Lavin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding a Shifchah Charufah (a Kena'anis slave or half-slave designated to an Eved Ivri) it says "Shichvas Zera" (one is liable only for a full Bi'ah, which can lead to semen). This implies that other Chayavei Lavin are liable for Ha'ara'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should learn contrarily! Since the Torah revealed that Chayavei Kerisus are liable for Ha'ara'ah, Chayavei Lavin are liable only for full Bi'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> If so, the Torah would not have needed to teach that Shifchah Charufah is liable only for full Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Ha'ara'ah is like Bi'ah regarding Chayavei Lavin of Kehunah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Kichah-Kichah".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Ha'ara'ah is considered like Bi'ah regarding Chayavei Aseh?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">55b----------------------------------------55b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Bi'ah-Bi'ah".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a Yevamah who has Bi'ah with a stranger is liable for Ha'ara'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Amora'im (49b) argue about whether this is Chayavei Lavin or Chayavei Aseh. In either case; we gave the source above!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, how do we know Ha'ara'ah is like full Bi'ah to acquire a Yevamah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Bi'ah-Bi'ah".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that Ha'ara'ah is like Bi'ah to make Kidushin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah, "Kichah-Kichah".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> The Torah writes "Shichvas Zera" regarding Shifchah Charufah, Eshes Ish, and Sotah. Why are all of these needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> We taught about Shifchah above;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 - part 2:</span> Regarding Eshes Ish, it excludes Bi'ah with Ever Mes (without Kishuy).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that exempts Bi'as Arayos with Ever Mes. According to the opinion that Bi'ah with an Ever Mes is liable regarding Arayos, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 - part 2:</span> It excludes Bi'ah with a married woman who died;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that since she is still considered 'She'er' after death, one is liable for her. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 3:</span> A Beraisa teaches why it says "Shichvas Zera" regarding a Sotah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Shichvas Zera" excludes something else.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> It excludes one who warned his wife against Bi'ah Lo k'Darkah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> It says "<i>Mishkevei</i> Ishah" (plural, to include Lo k'Darkah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> It excludes warning against intimacy other than Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Did the Torah really forbid [a wife to her husband due to] mere lewdness?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Abaye):</span> It excludes warning against Neshikah (touching of the genitals).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is like the opinion that Ha'ara'ah is entrance of the crown (of the Ever). According to the opinion that says that it is Neshikah, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Defense (of Answer #2):</span> Really, it excludes warning against intimacy other than Bi'ah. One would have thought that everything depends on the whims of the husband, and he is insistent on this (so it is valid warning). The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHAT IS <i>HA'ARA'AH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Ha'ara'ah is Neshikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like one who puts his finger on his mouth. Perforce, it will make some indentation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah citing R. Yochanan):</span> The Torah is Mechayev for full Bi'ah with a Shifchah Charufah. This is entrance of the crown.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes - Beraisa):</span> He is liable only for a Bi'ah of Miruk.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is when he fully enters the Ever (Tosfos; Rashi - he empties the Ever of its semen)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he fully enters the crown.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi citing R. Yochanan):</span> Ha'ara'ah is the entrance of the crown.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Talmidim:</span> Rabah bar bar Chanah said otherwise in R. Yochanan's name!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Dimi:</span> Either he is a liar, or I am!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin, citing R. Yochanan):</span> Ha'ara'ah is the entrance of the crown.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>He certainly disagrees with Rabah bar bar Chanah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must we say that he disagrees with Shmuel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. From Neshikah until entrance of the crown he calls Ha'ara'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah citing R. Yochanan):</span> Ha'ara'ah is the entrance of the crown. Full Bi'ah is literally full Bi'ah. Less than this is only Neshikah, and one is exempt for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>He disagrees with Shmuel.</p>
