<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>SISTERS THAT FALL TO YIBUM TOGETHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah #1):</span> If two of four brothers were married to sisters and they died, the surviving brothers do Chalitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In our Mishnah, why may one do Yibum?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are two explanations why Mishnah #1 forbids Yibum. Neither applies here.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Explanation #1:</span> Yesh Zikah (it is as if both sisters are Mekudashos to each brother).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Explanation #2:</span> It is forbidden to Mevatel the Mitzvah of Yibum. (If we allow Yibum, perhaps Reuven will do Yibum with one and Shimon will die, and her sister will be exempt without Yibum or Chalitzah, for she is Achos Ishto of Reuven!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>In our Mishnah, each can say that he does Yibum with his Yevamah (and he has nothing to do with her sister)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If they both did Yibum, they may keep their wives.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shila - Beraisa):</span> This is even if they are Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Isur for a Kohen to marry a Chalutzah is only mid'Rabanan. Chachamim did not forbid a Safek (if the Kohen really did Yibum, the Chalitzah that preceded it was meaningless.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Isur is mid'Oraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "<i>And</i> a divorced woman (is forbidden to a Kohen)" includes a Chalutzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Isur is only mid'Rabanan; the verse is only an Asmachta.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE MITZVAH IS INCUMBENT ON THE OLDEST BROTHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Mitzvah is for the oldest brother to do Yibum. If a younger brother did Yibum, it is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "And the firstborn..." - the Mitzvah is for the oldest to do Yibum;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>"That will give birth" excludes an Ailonis, who cannot give birth;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>"Yakum Al Shem Achiv "- for inheritance.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this commands to name the child like the deceased?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says here, "Yakum Al Shem Achiv", like it says elsewhere, "Al Shem Acheihem Yikar'u b'Nachalasam". Just like there "Shem" refers to inheritance, also here.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>"His name will not be wiped out" excludes a Seris, whose name is wiped out (even had he not died, he could not have children).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Everywhere else in the Torah, a verse does not depart from its simple meaning. Here, a Gezeirah Shavah entirely uproots the simple meaning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Without the Gezeirah Shavah, how could one think that the Mitzvah is to name the child after the deceased? Who would be commanded about this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Yavam were commanded, it should have said 'Yakum Al Shem Achicha (your brother)'!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Beis Din were commanded, it should have said 'Yakum Al Shem Achi Aviv (his father's brother)'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah would instruct Beis Din to tell the Yavam to call the child after the deceased.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Gezeirah Shavah teaches not to understand this way. (Rather, it discusses inheritance.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHY DID THE TORAH SPECIFY THE FIRSTBORN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa taught that the oldest is commanded to do Yibum. We should say that only a firstborn does Yibum!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This cannot be, for then we would not need the verse exempting Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo from Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Achai):</span> Perhaps this exclusion applies when the newborn brother is a firstborn to his mother!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah made Yibum dependent on inheritance, which is only from the father.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Yibum applies only when there is a firstborn (and then, any brother may do Yibum)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "And one of them died" connotes that either (of the two brothers) died, even the firstborn, and it says to do Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps (to fulfill "And the firstborn..." we must say that) this is only when a younger brother died, and the firstborn does Yibum!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, we would not need a verse exempting Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Yibum of a younger brother is valid only when there is no firstborn!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "When brothers will live together" equates the brothers (any may do the Mitzvah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that when there is a firstborn, the Mitzvah is on the oldest; when there is no firstborn, there is no preference. A Beraisa teaches otherwise!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye Kashisha - Beraisa):</span> The Mitzvah is for the oldest to do Yibum. If he declines, we ask his younger brother. If he declines, we return to the oldest.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The oldest is like a firstborn. Just like a firstborn is first to do Yibum, also the oldest (even if he is not a firstborn) is first.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should say that a firstborn who does Yibum inherits the deceased, but a regular brother who does Yibum does not!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span>  Even a regular brother fulfills "Yakum Al Shem Achiv".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Torah specify the firstborn?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">24b----------------------------------------24b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This diminishes his inheritance of the deceased;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like a firstborn gets an extra portion only from Muchzak (what his deceased father already had), not from Ra'uy (what was destined to come to him), also, a Yavam.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHEN DO WE ACCEPT CONVERTS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was suspected of Bi'ah with a slave or Nochris and she converted, he should not marry her. If he did, he may stay married;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If Reuven was suspected of Bi'ah with a married woman, and they (Beis Din) made her husband divorce her, even if Reuven married her; he must divorce her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> If she converts, the conversion is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Nechemyah):</span> If one converted to marry a woman or man, or to receive food or authority from the king, the conversion is invalid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one converted to be saved from lions, because of a dream, or in the days of Mordechai and Esther (when people feared the Yisraelim), the conversion is invalid, unless he converts nowadays.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Rather, it must be like nowadays (when surely it is not for authority).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yitzchak bar Shmuel said that the Halachah follows the opinion that all these are valid conversions.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he should be allowed to marry her!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One should not cause people to speak ill about him;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> (The Mishnah forbids marrying her due to) "Remove from yourself stiff talk and ill rumors".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not accept converts in the era of Mashi'ach. Similarly, we did not accept in the days of David and Shlomo.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> We learn from "Hen Gur Yagur..." (only one who dwells with us (he converts) when Hash-m is not with us, i.e. in our poverty, will receive a portion with us in the world to come).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>ONE SUSPECTED OF ADULTERY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was suspected of Bi'ah with a married woman...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> This applies only if there were witnesses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes:</span> Rav must have been sleeping when he said this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes against Rav - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven was suspected of Bi'ah with a married woman, and Beis Din made her husband divorce her, and she married David and was divorced, and Reuven married her, he may keep her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If witnesses saw that Reuven had Bi'ah with her, even if she married someone else in between, which stops the rumors, she is forbidden to Reuven!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, there are no witnesses. They may stay married only because she married someone else in between and ceased the rumors. This is unlike Rav!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav holds that even if she didn't get married in between, they can stay married. We force them to separate only when there are witnesses.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that even when she married David in between, l'Chatchilah she may not remarry Reuven.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> This applies when she has no children. If she has children, they may stay married;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If there are witnesses of adultery, even if she has many children he must divorce her!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav establishes our Mishnah to be when there are witnesses, and she has children.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What forced Rav to establish our Mishnah in such a case, to say that we force them to separate only when there are witnesses? He could have said that she has no children, and we force them to separate even without witnesses!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Mishnah is difficult;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say 'they made him divorce her'? It should say 'he divorced her'!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that Beis Din forced the divorce. Beis Din forces only when there are witnesses</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Questions (d) and (f)):</span> The Beraisos are like Rebbi (who says that we force without witnesses).</p></div>
