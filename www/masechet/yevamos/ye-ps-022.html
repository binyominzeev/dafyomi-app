<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>HOW MANY <i>SHENIYOS</i> ARE THERE?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Hillel:</span> In any case, I saw that they were listed as forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> If you saw that they were permitted, you would not rely on it, since Mar brei d'Ravna didn't sign on it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>For the same reason, don't rely on what you saw that they are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - d'Vei R. Chiya):</span> The third (generation granddaughters) from his son and daughter and from his wife's son and daughter are Sheniyos;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The fourth (generation of grandmothers from his father-in-law and mother-in-law are Sheniyos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> (The wife's great grandmother and great granddaughter are Sheniyos.) Why does his wife count towards the generations above her (so the fourth is called a Sheniyah), but not towards the generations below (the third is called a Sheniyah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The generations above are forbidden due to her, but the generations below are not (they are forbidden due to him).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The (great grand)son and (great grand)daughter of his wife are forbidden because of her, yet she is not counted among the generations!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since we counted three generations below himself and did not count himself, we also do not count her among the generations below her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Do the Sheniyos of R. Chiya extend to all generations?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Kahana):</span> Since Rav (21a) listed only four that do not extend, this shows that all others extend.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps Rav referred only to Sheniyos in that Beraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Chiya said that the third/fourth generations below/above are forbidden. This shows that past that are permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps he forbids from the third/fourth and onward.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> In Eretz Yisrael, they asked whether or not Sheniyos apply to converts.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Even Arayos are forbidden to converts only so they will not say that they descended to a lower Kedushah (e.g. 'before converting I was forbidden to my mother. Now I am permitted!'). Certainly, there was no decree of Sheniyos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Maternal brothers who converted should not testify for each other. If they did, the testimony stands. (Converted) paternal brothers may testify for each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> Even maternal brothers may testify for each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different than Arayos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Arayos pertain to every person (if we permit Arayos to converts, perhaps Yisraelim will marry Arayos). Testimony is received by Beis Din. (Beis Din will not err; they know that) a convert is like a newborn.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ON WHOM DOES <i>YIBUM</i> DEPEND?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A brother from any place (i.e. mother) obligates his brother's wife to do Yibum or Chalitzah. He is like a brother in every respect;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The only exceptions are a brother from a slave or Nochris.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A son from any place (i.e. mother) exempts his father's wife from Yibum and Chalitzah. He is liable for striking or cursing his father. He is like a son in every respect;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The only exceptions are a son from a slave or Nochris.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does 'from any place' come to include?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It includes a Mamzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Obviously, he is his brother!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that a Gezeirah Shavah "Achvah-Achvah" from Yakov's sons teaches that just like there they are proper, also Yibum depends on proper brothers;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since a Mamzer exempts (his mother) from Yibum, he also is Zokek (obligates his brother's widow to do Yibum or Chalitzah).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He is his brother in every respect.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this teach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When the Mamzer dies, his brother inherits him, and (if he is a Kohen) becomes Tamei to bury him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious, for he is his brother!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Kohen becomes Tamei "Ki Im li'Sh'eiro ha'Karov Elav" (only for his close relatives);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learned that "She'eiro" refers to his wife;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Lo Yitama Ba'al b'Amav Lehechalo" teaches that a husband does not become Tamei in every case. He becomes Tamei for a permitted wife, but not for a forbidden wife.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>One might have thought that here also, he makes himself Tamei for a proper brother, but not for an illegitimate brother. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The forbidden wife is destined to be divorced. This does not apply to a brother who is a Mamzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Except for a child from a slave or a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>We learn from "The woman (Shifchah) and her children will be to her master" (i.e. the children are slaves, like her. Below (23a) we discuss children of a Nochris.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A CHILD WHO IS A <i>MAMZER</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any child exempts from Yibum and obligates his brother's wife to do Yibum (or Chalitzah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does 'any' come to include?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It includes a Mamzer;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We read "U'Ven <i>Ein</i> Lo" like 'Ayen' (investigate to see if he has any son, even a Mamzer).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He is liable for striking (or cursing) his father.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Isur "Do not curse a Nasi in your nation" applies to one who acts like your nation. (Likewise, there is no Isur to curse a wicked father, e.g. one who fathered a Mamzer!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We answer like Rav Pinchas said (elsewhere). The case is, he repented.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can he really repent for this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Menasya):</span> "The crooked cannot be fixed" applies to one who had Bi'ah with Ervah and fathered a Mamzer!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In any case, now he acts like your nation.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE PUNISHMENT FOR <i>BI'AH</i> WITH A SISTER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who has Bi'ah with his sister, who is the daughter of his father's wife, is liable for both of these Arayos;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yosi bar Yehudah says, he is liable only for Achoso.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Chachamim's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - Question:</span> Since it says "Ervas Achoscha Vas Avicha O Vas Imecha", why must it also say "Ervas Bas Eshes Avicha Moledes Avicha Achoscha Hi"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is Mechayev (one who has Bi'ah with a sister born through wedlock) for both of these;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah expounds "Achoscha Hi" - you are liable only for this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Chachamim use "Achoscha Hi" to teach that one is liable for a full sister.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This teaches that we do not punish from a Kal va'Chomer. (Even though one is liable for a half-sister, another verse is needed to be Mechayev for a full sister.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, "Achoscha" would suffice to teach this. "Hi" is extra, to teach that he is liable only for this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Chachamim say, if not for "Hi", one would think that normally we punish from a Kal va'Chomer;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why would the Torah have written "Achoscha"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah sometimes writes things that could be learned from a Kal va'Chomer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, if so "Achoscha Hi" should have been written in the other verse.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah learn from "Bas Eshes Avicha"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that the mother could be married to your father. It excludes a sister from a slave or Nochris, for the mother could not be married to your father.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it excludes a sister from a woman raped by his father!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection - Contradiction (Rava):</span> "Ervas Bas Bincha O Vas Bitcha Lo Segaleh" implies that your wife's granddaughters (who are not from you) are permitted. However, "Ervas Ishah u'Vitah Lo Segaleh Es Bas Benah v'Es Bas Bitah..." forbids them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution (Rava):</span> If a man raped or enticed a woman, he is permitted to her granddaughters that are not from him. If he married a woman, all her granddaughters are forbidden.</p></div>
