<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A KOHEN GADOL THAT DOES YIBUM WITH A WIDOW</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan or R. Elazar):</span> If a Kohen Gadol did Yibum with a widow, the Tzarah is exempted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(The other of R. Yochanan and R. Elazar):</span> She is not exempted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If she was widowed from marriage all agree that she does not exempt the Tzarah, for an Aseh does not override an Aseh and a Lav;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue about a widow from Kidushin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One opinion says that she exempts the Tzarah, because an Aseh overrides a Lav;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The other opinion says that she doesn't exempt the Tzarah. The Aseh doesn't override the Lav, since Chalitzah could be done.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If they did Yibum, he acquires her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This shows that the Aseh overrides the Lav. It refutes the opinion that the Tzarah is not exempted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refutes Reish Lakish (who says that when it is possible to fulfill both, the Aseh doesn't override the Lav).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Chalitzah is not considered a fulfillment of Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE SOURCE FOR SHENIYOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Where does the Torah hint at Sheniyos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> "Kol ha'To'evos ha'El (harsh)" implies that other sexual abominations are lighter, i.e. Sheniyos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that "ha'El" means harsh?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He took Eilei (the strong ones) of the land".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rava disagrees with R. Levi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> The punishment for unjust measures is harsher than for Arayos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Regarding measures it says "ha'Eleh". Regarding Arayos it says "ha'El"; the former is harsher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It also says "ha'Eleh" regarding Arayos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That teaches that there is Kares for Arayos, but not for unjust measures.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are measures stricter?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One can do proper Teshuvah for Arayos (if he did not father a Mamzer), but not for having cheated with unjust measures (he does not know to whom to return the money).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yehudah):</span> Sheniyos are hinted at in "He made handles, investigated and enacted many parables".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Before Shlomo, the Torah was like a basket without handles (safeguards against sin). Shlomo made handles for it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Oshaya):</span> "Go away; do not pass through (increase Isurim mid'Rabanan to keep people far from transgressing the Torah itself). Veer away, then pass."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> There is a parable for R. Oshaya's teaching. If a man has an orchard and he guards it from the outside, it is totally guarded. If he guards it from the inside, what is in front of him is guarded, what is in back of him is not guarded.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This parable is inaccurate! If one guards from the inside, at least what is in front of him is guarded. Without Sheniyos, people would stumble in Ervah itself!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Kahana):</span> "U'Shmartem Es Mishmarti" - make something to guard for My guarding.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, Sheniyos are mid'Oraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> It is mid'Oraisa, but Chachamim explained it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Chachamim explain the entire Torah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, Sheniyos are mid'Rabanan; the verse is only an Asmachta.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHICH ARE THE SHENIYOS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> These are the Sheniyos: a man is forbidden to his two grandmothers (the mothers of his mother and father), the wives of his two grandfathers, the wives of his father's maternal brother and his mother's paternal brother, and the daughters-in-law of his son and daughter;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A man may marry the (ex-)wives of his father-in-law and stepson;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>He may not marry his stepson's daughter. A stepson may marry the (ex-)wife or daughter of his stepfather.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>His stepson's wife says to him 'I am permitted to you, but my daughter is forbidden to you.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah forbids his stepson's daughter! "(Do not marry) the daughter of her (your wife's) son or daughter..."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the Torah forbids her. The Tana wanted to teach 'His stepson's wife says to him, I am permitted to you, my daughter is forbidden to you'. I.e. even though her daughter is forbidden mid'Oraisa, Chachamim did not decree against her;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>To teach this saying in the Seifa, the Tana needed to teach the Isur of the stepson's daughter in the Reisha, even though it is not Sheniyos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> His father-in-law's wife can also say that 'I am permitted to you, but my daughter is forbidden to you', since she is Achos Ishto!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The daughter of his stepson is permanently forbidden to him, so it was taught. His father-in-law's wife is forbidden only in the life of his wife, so it was not taught.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>EXTENDED SHENIYOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> In most cases, when a relative is forbidden, Chachamim forbade all similar relatives in prior or later generations. There are four relatives for which the Isur does not extend.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rav was sure about three of them - the wives of one's mother's paternal brother and his father's maternal brother, and his daughter-in-law;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Ze'iri added the wife of his mother's father.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> A way to remember this is (Ze'iri added) 'what is (a generation) above (his mother's paternal brother's wife, one of the Sheniyos of) Rav.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav list this case?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It can be confused with the wife of the father's father. (We are adamant to forbid all generations above the father's father's wife, lest people permit the father's wife, which is an Isur Torah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Ze'iri is not concerned for this. A man is frequent in his father's house, so he will not err. He is infrequent in his mother's house, so he may err.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A daughter-in-law is a Torah Isur! (Why did Rav list it among Sheniyos?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he refers to the daughter-in-law of his son.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> His son's daughter-in-law is not a limited Isur!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One's daughter-in-law is Ervah. His son's daughter-in-law is a Sheniyah. This applies to the daughter-in-law of his son, and of his son's son, and of his son's son's son for all generations.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he refers to his daughter's daughter-in-law.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda, citing R. Ami):</span> The daughter-in-law was only prohibited because of the daughter-in-law.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> Before I was a Chacham, astrologers told me that I would be a Chacham. I reasoned that if I will be a great Chacham, I will explain R. Ami's teaching, If I will be a teacher of children, I will ask others to explain it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The daughter's daughter-in-law was forbidden only due to (concern lest one marry) the son's daughter-in-law.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We are concerned about cases like Bar Tzisai's daughter-in-law (both his son and daughter had daughters-in-law, and they could be confused).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>WHICH WOMEN WERE DECREED SHENIYOS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the law of the wife of the mother's maternal brother?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(The Torah forbids the wife of the father's paternal brother.) We decreed about the wives of the father's maternal brother and the mother's paternal brother, which have a paternal side. When there is no paternal side, we do not decree;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, do we decree in every case?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Safra):</span> The Isur when there is one paternal side is a decree. We do not decree to guard a decree!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> In many cases we decree to guard a decree!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>His mother is Ervah, and his mother's mother is a Sheniyah. We decree about his father's mother due to the mother's mother!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is because they are all called grandmothers.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>His father's wife is Ervah, and his father's father's wife is a Sheniyah. We forbid his mother's father's wife due to his father's father's wife.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is because they are all called wives of grandfathers.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The wife of his father's paternal brother is Ervah; the wife of his father's maternal brother is a Sheniyah. We forbid the wife of his mother's paternal brother due to the wife of the father's maternal brother.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is because they are all wives of his uncle.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The question remains, is the wife of his mother's maternal brother forbidden?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah bar Shila):</span> In Eretz Yisrael, they say that whenever the female is Ervah, they decreed that the wife of the corresponding male is a Sheniyah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> This is not always true! A mother-in-law is Ervah, but a father-in-law's wife is permitted (after she is divorced or widowed)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The daughter of his mother-in-law is Ervah, but the wife of his mother-in-law's son is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The daughter of his father-in-law is Ervah, but the wife of his father-in-law's son is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>His stepdaughter is Ervah, but his stepson's wife is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>The daughter of his stepdaughter is Ervah, but the wife of his stepdaughter's son is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Surely, Rav Yehudah bar Shila came to include the wife of the mother's maternal brother (she is a Sheniyah, for she corresponds to the mother's maternal sister, who is Ervah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this case different (than Rava's cases, in which they did not decree)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This case involves only one Kidushin. Rava's cases involve two acts of Kidushin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mesharshiya):</span> Are the paternal grandfather's sister and the paternal grandfather's brother's wife Sheniyos?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since the generation below them is Ervah, we decree;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, since these are distant generations, we do not decree!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papi):</span> The Mishnah lists the Sheniyos, and omits these cases!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Tana omitted cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What else did he omit? (Surely, he would not omit just these!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He also omitted the Sheniyos of R. Chiya (Daf 40b).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>Ameimar permitted the cases that Rav Mesharshiya asked about.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Hillel):</span> I saw the Sheniyos of Mar brei d'Ravna; there are 16.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> These are the eight of our Mishnah, six of R. Chiya, and the two in question!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so there are 17, for we concluded that the wife of the mother's maternal brother is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> These two (that Rav Mesharshiya asked about) are similar, so they are counted like one.</p></div>
