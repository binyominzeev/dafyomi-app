<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MAY AN <i>AREL</i> EAT <i>MA'ASER</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 1:a, 73a - Beraisa):</span> If strands were left that invalidate the Milah, he may not eat Terumah, Pesach, Kodshim or Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refers to Ma'aser (Sheni) of grain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> No, it refers to Ma'aser Behemah (one of every 10 animals born each year becomes a Korban).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That is Kodshim, which the Beraisa already listed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Pesach was also listed, even though it is Kodshim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is necessary to teach both Pesach and Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Had it taught only Pesach, one might have thought that this is because the Torah explicitly forbids an Arel to eat Pesach, but this does not apply to Kodshim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Had it taught only Kodshim, one might have thought that this refers only to Pesach!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We cannot explain why it would teach Ma'aser Behemah in addition to Kodshim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> The Beraisa refers to Ma'aser Rishon. It is like R. Meir, who says that only Leviyim may eat Ma'aser Rishon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Chiya bar Rav mi'Difti's Beraisa):</span> Two kinds of Ma'aser are forbidden to an Arel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refers to Ma'aser Sheni and Ma'aser Behemah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it refers to (Ma'aser Beheimah and) Ma'aser Rishon, according to R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Beraisa #1):</span> An Onen is forbidden to eat Ma'aser, and permitted to Terumah and Parah Adumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Tevul Yom is forbidden to Terumah and permitted to Ma'aser and Parah Adumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Mechusar Kipurim (one who must bring a Korban to complete his Taharah) is forbidden to Parah Adumah and permitted to Terumah and Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of answer:</span> If an Arel were permitted to Ma'aser, the Beraisa should teach that an Arel is forbidden to Terumah and permitted to Parah Adumah and Ma'aser!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This Tana is R. Akiva, who considers an Arel like a Tamei (Rashi - so he is forbidden even to Parah Adumah. Rambam, according to Maharsha - R. Akiva forbids an Arel to Ma'aser. We ask about Chachamim's opinion):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> "Ish Ish" (regarding the Isur for a Tamei to eat Terumah) includes an Arel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of Beraisa #1 (who forbids Mechusar Kipurim to Parah Adumah? We follow the Gra's text.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Yosef ha'Bavli:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If an Onen or Mechusar Kipurim burned Parah Adumah, it is Kosher;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yosef ha'Bavli says, if an Onen burned it, it is Kosher. If a Mechusar Kipurim burned it, it is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>(Rambam - not only R. Akiva, but) also R. Yitzchak forbids an Arel to Ma'aser from a Gezeirah Shavah "Mimenu-Mimenu";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "Mimenu" regarding Pesach and regarding Ma'aser. Just like an Arel is forbidden to Pesach, also to Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WE LEARN FROM <i>PESACH</i> TO <i>MA'ASER</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The words must be free to learn the Gezeirah Shavah. If not, we cannot learn from Pesach, since it has the stringencies of Pigul, Nosar, and (Kares for a person who eats it when he is) Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Affirmation:</span> Yes, the words are free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can we show that the words are free?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It says "Mimenu" three times regarding Pesach. One is needed for the simple meaning (the Isur to eat it raw applies only to Pesach, not to Matzah and Maror), and two are extra. One of the two is used for the Gezeirah Shavah. (The other was merely included with the verse that discusses burning the Nosar);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that this Aseh (to burn Nosar) exempts the Lav (not to leave it over) from lashes, since the Torah needed to say 'Nosar', it also says "Mimenu";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to the opinion that the verse mandates waiting another morning before burning it, since the Torah needed to say "until morning", it also says "Mimenu".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>It says "Mimenu" three times regarding Ma'aser. One is needed for the simple meaning, and two are extra. One of these two teaches R. Avahu's law (73b, that one may burn Tamei Terumah). The other teaches Reish Lakish's law:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "V'Lo Nasati Mimenu l'Mes", but a similar usage for a living person, i.e. anointing, is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This teaches that one may anoint with Tamei Ma'aser Sheni.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Zutra):</span> Perhaps the verse forbids buying a coffin or shrouds with Ma'aser Sheni!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> "Mimenu" - from (Ma'aser) itself (not from its value).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> "V'Lo Nasati" is like (what follows it,) "I did not eat". Just like the latter refers to the Ma'aser itself, also the former.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The Gezeirah Shavah is free from one side (what is written by Pesach).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that in such a case, we learn and do not challenge;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that we learn and challenge, how can we answer? (We can challenge like above (a)!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (The Gezeirah Shavah is free both sides.) We learn R. Avahu's law (not from "Mimenu", rather,) like Rav Nachman:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> "V'Nasati Lecha Es Mishmeres Terumosai (plural)" alludes to two Terumos, Tahor and Tamei. It is "Lecha" (for your needs); you may cook with it while burning it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>TEMEI'IM</i> MAY NOT EAT <i>TERUMAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All Temei'im (may not eat Terumah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> We learn from "Any man from the seed of Aharon (who is a Metzora or Zav will not eat Kodshim until he is Tahor.)"</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">74b----------------------------------------74b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This refers to Terumah, which all seed of Aharon (i.e. even females) may eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the verse refers to Chazeh v'Shok (from Shelamim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Some females, e.g. a Bas Kohen who returns to eat Terumah after being widowed or divorced from a Yisrael, may not eat them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Likewise, a Chalalah may not eat Terumah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Chalalah is not considered the seed of Aharon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that "Until he is Tahor" refers to nightfall? Perhaps it means after he brings his Korban (then he may eat Terumah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> The verse discusses a Zav who had two emissions and a Metzora Musgar, who do not bring Korbanos, similar to a Tamei Mes (at the end of the verse. Therefore, "Yithar" must refer to nightfall.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Perhaps a Tamei who must bring a Korban (e.g. a Zav who had three emissions and a Metzora Muchlat) is forbidden to Terumah until he offers it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> What is the source for the following Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> After immersing, he may eat Ma'aser. After dark, he may eat Terumah. After offering his Korban, he may eat Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions (Rava):</span> There are three verses (which seem to contradict each other)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"He will not eat Kodshim until bathing" implies that after Tevilah he is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It also says "At nightfall he will be Tahor, then he will eat Kodshim";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It also says "The Kohen will atone for her and she will be Tahor"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> The first verse refers to Ma'aser, the second to Terumah, and the third to Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the first refers to Terumah, and the second to Ma'aser!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Presumably, Terumah is more stringent:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Tamei who eats it is Chayav Misah (b'Yedei Shamayim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Zar who eats it b'Shogeg adds a Chomesh (when paying for what he ate);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It cannot be redeemed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>It is forbidden to a Zar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ma'aser has more stringencies!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It must be brought to Yerushalayim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One must recite Viduy over it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It is forbidden to an Onen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>One may not burn Tamei Ma'aser, and one who eats Tamei Ma'aser is lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Bi'ur applies to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Misah is more stringent (this is the overriding consideration).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Even without this, it says "A soul (that will touch... will immerse and be Tahor)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ma'aser applies to every soul (but only Kohanim eat Terumah).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHEN IS THE<i> KORBAN ME'AKEV</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this only applies to a Tamei who is not Mechusar Kipurim, but a Mechusar Kipurim may not eat until he brings his Korban!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It says about a Yoledes (one who gave birth) "Until the days of her Taharah are completed". This implies that once the days are completed, she is Tehorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradicition:</span> It also says "The Kohen will atone for her and she will be Tehorah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Resolution):</span> The first verse teaches when she can eat Terumah. The latter teaches when she may eat Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should say the other way!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Presumably, Kodshim is more stringent, because:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It can become Pigul;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It can become Nosar;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It is brought in the Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Me'ilah applies to it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>A Tamei who eats it is Chayav Kares,</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Terumah is more stringent, because:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Tamei who eats it is Chayav Misah (b'Yedei Shamayim);</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>It is forbidden to a Zar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Kodshim have more stringencies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Even without this, we cannot say that Mechusar Kipurim is permitted to Kodshim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"The Kohen will atone for her and she will be Tehorah" implies that she is Teme'ah until then;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She cannot eat Kodshim, for "(Kodesh) meat that any Tamei will touch may not be eaten"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Mechusar Kipurim can be permitted only to Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> The verse cannot discuss Terumah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Bnei Yisrael" teaches that Tumas Yoledes applies only to Benos Yisrael!</p>
