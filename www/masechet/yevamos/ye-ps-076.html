<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHICH PROBLEMS CAUSE STERILITY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A case occurred, a man's conduit for seed was closed, and it would come out through the place for urine. Rav Bivi bar Abaye intended to rule that he is Kosher.\Chazon Ish 12:7</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Papi):</span> This cannot be! Seed is cooked only in its proper conduit (so he cannot have children)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> If the Ever was punctured and sealed, if the seal tears during an emission of semen, he is (sterile and) forbidden. If not, he is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This cannot refer to a puncture below the crown. There, even if cut, he is Kosher!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, the puncture is in the crown itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Mari bar Mar citing Shmuel):</span> If the crown was punctured and sealed, he is forbidden only if the seal tears when he has an emission.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava brei d'Rabah):</span> How do we cause him to have an emission to check this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> We put warm barley bread by his anus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Is everyone like Yakov Avinu, who called Reuven "My first strength" because he never had an emission before that?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> We pass colored women's clothing in front of him, and this causes him to have an emission.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Is everyone (steeped in lust) like Barzilai ha'Gil'adi?! (This is not enough to cause an emission!) Rather, we do like Rav Yosef said.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If it is punctured, he is forbidden, because the seed drips out. If it is sealed, he is Kosher, since he can have children. <i>This</i> is a disqualification that can revert to Kashrus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which case does 'this' exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It excludes a scab that developed over a bruise. This is not a proper sealing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> How do we seal a puncture?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> We cut around the puncture with barley and rub the area with oil. We bring a big ant, have it bite the area, and cut off its head.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Only barley may be used. Iron would cause a bruise or inflammation.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This remedy helps only for a small puncture. If it is big, the sealing will peel off.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> One who urinates through two openings is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah does not follow him, nor (the following law of) his father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Women who rub their genitals together are disqualified from Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Even R. Elazar, who says that Bi'as Zenus makes a woman a Zonah, says so only about Bi'ah with a man. Two women together is mere lewdness.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE ISUR OF A PETZU'A DAKA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Petzu'a Daka or Krus Shofchah is permitted to a convert or freed slave; he is only forbidden to Kehal (Yisraelim) - "He will not enter Kehal Hash-m".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> May a Petzu'a Daka Kohen marry a convert or freed slave?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he retains his Kedushah, he is forbidden. If he lost his Kedushah, he is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes - Beraisa):</span> A Petzu'a Daka Yisrael may marry a Nesinah (a convert from the seven Kena'ani nations).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he retains his Kedushah, he would transgress "Do not intermarry with them"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> That Isur does not depend on Kedushah. It is because their children might serve idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Isur is only while they are Nochrim. After conversion the Torah permits them, but Chachamim decreed against them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim forbade only people who can have children.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> A Mamzer can have children. Why is he permitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Mamzerim and Nesinim may intermarry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Retraction (of statement 2):</span> Rather, Chachamim forbade only people of Kosher lineage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (of objection (d) - Rava):</span> "Do not intermarry with them" applies only after conversion. Before this, marriage does not take effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> "Shlomo married the daughter of Paro, King of Mitzrayim".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He converted her beforehand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We did not accept converts in the days of David and Shlomo!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is because we suspected that they convert only for wealth. Paro's daughter was already wealthy!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">76b----------------------------------------76b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If she converted, she was a Mitzris Rishonah, and was forbidden! (The Torah forbids the first two generations of Mitzri converts.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Mitzriyim perished, and other nations settled in Mitzrayim (and Paro's daughter was from them).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Minyamin my colleague was a Mitzri Rishon. He married a Mitzris Rishonah, and planned to marry his son to a Mitzris Sheniyah (second generation Mitzris), so his grandchildren would be permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (f) - Rav Papa):</span> Shlomo did not marry Bas Paro - "The forbidden nations ... Shlomo clung to love (not marriage)".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Va'Yischaten" (he married her)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because he loved her excessively, the verse calls it marriage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina - Mishnah):</span> A Petzu'a Daka or Krus Shofchah is permitted to a convert or freed slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He is forbidden to a Nesinah (this contradicts the Beraisa (c))!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rav Ashi - Seifa of Mishnah):</span> He is only forbidden to Kehal (Hash-m).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This implies that he may marry a Nesinah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> The implications in the Mishnah contradict each other, so we cannot infer the law of a Nesinah. (Therefore, we can say that the Mishnah agrees with the Beraisa.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE ISUR OF AMONIM AND MO'AVIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (Male) Amonim and Mo'avim are forever forbidden. Females are permitted immediately;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Mitzriyim and Edomim are forbidden until three generations, males and females;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon permits females immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> A Kal va'Chomer permits them. When males are forbidden forever (Amon and Mo'av), the females are permitted immediately. When the males are forbidden only for two generations, all the more so females are permitted immediately!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> If you have a tradition for your law, we accept it. If not, we can challenge your Kal va'Chomer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> I have a tradition.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source that females of Amon and Mo'av are permitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> "Sha'ul asked 'Who is this youth (David)?'... Avner said 'I do not know.'"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Sha'ul certainly knew who David was - "He loved him greatly, he (David) carried his (Sha'ul's) Kelim"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Sha'ul asked about David's father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Sha'ul certainly knew who David's father was - "The man was a famous sage ..."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> This is Yishai, who was appointed over 600,000!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Sha'ul asked if David descends from Peretz or from Zerach;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he comes from Peretz he will be king, since a king is Poretz (breaks fences) to make a path for himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If he comes from Zerach, he is merely important.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Sha'ul inquire about David?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Sha'ul clothed David in his (Sha'ul's) garments, like his measure". (This suggested that David would be king, for) Sha'ul was "From his shoulder and above taller than the whole nation"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Doeg ha'Edomi:</span> Before asking if he is fit for kingship, ask if he may marry into Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Avner:</span> Why shouldn't he be?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Do'eg:</span> He descends from Rus the Mo'avis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Avner:</span> We learned that an Amoni and a Mo'avi are forbidden, but an Amonis and a Mo'avis are not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Question (Doeg):</span> If so, you should say that a Mamzer is forbidden, but not a Mamzeres!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Avner):</span> "MaMZeR" alludes to MuM ZaR (a foreign blemish), which applies equally to women.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><span class="cl">Question (Doeg):</span> If so, you should say that a Mitzri is forbidden, not a Mitzris!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Avner):</span> The Isur of Mo'av is different, since the Torah specified the reason - "Because they did not go out to greet you with bread and water";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This reason does not apply to women, for it is normal for men to go out to greet, but not for women.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">15.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Doeg):</span> The men should have gone out to greet the men, and the women to greet the women!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">16.</span>Avner was silent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">17.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "The king said 'ask whose son is this EleM (youth)'". Before, he is called a "Na'ar"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">18.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Sha'ul hinted to Avner 'this law NisALMah (is hidden) from you. Go ask in the Beis Medrash.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">19.</span>He asked. They said that Amoni is forbidden, but not Amonis, and similarly Mo'avi but not Mo'avis.</p>
