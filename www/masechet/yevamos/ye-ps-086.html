<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WIDOWS THAT EAT <i>TERUMAH</i> AND <i>MA'ASER</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Even a non-Levi may eat Ma'aser!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Meir, who permits Ma'aser Rishon only to Leviyim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Terumah is given to (and eaten by) a Kohen, and Ma'aser to a Levi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer ben Azaryah permits Ma'aser even to a Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This implies that someone forbids (a Kohen to eat Ma'aser. This is unreasonable!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> R. Eliezer ben Azaryah permits <i>giving</i> Ma'aser even to a Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Meir's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha brei d'Rava citing a tradition):</span> A verse equates Ma'aser Rishon to Terumah to teach that just like Terumah is forbidden to a Zar, so Ma'aser is forbidden to a non-Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like a Zar who eats Terumah is Chayav Misah (b'Yedei Shamayim, if he was Mezid) and adds a fifth (when paying for what he b'Shogeg), the same applies to (a non-Levi who eats) Ma'aser!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "They will die for it (Terumah) ... and add a fifth on it" - "for it" and not for Ma'aser; "on it" and not on Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Chachamim say, Ma'aser is equated to Terumah to teach that just like failure to separate Terumah is Tovel (forbids eating the produce), also regarding Ma'aser Rishon:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Beraisa - R. Yosi) Question:</span> One might have thought that one is liable for Tevel only if nothing was separated. What is the source to Mechayev if Terumah was separated, but not Ma'aser Rishon, or Ma'aser Rishon but not Ma'aser Sheni or (even) Ma'aser Oni?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "You cannot eat in your gates" and "They will eat in your gates";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The latter verse refers to Ma'aser Oni. Likewise, the former forbids produce that still 'contains' (i.e. is Tevel to) Ma'aser Oni.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Had we learned only from these verses, one might have thought that eating such Tevel is only a Lav. Ma'aser is equated to Terumah to teach that one is Chayav Misah for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question:</span> We learn that Ma'aser Rishon is Tovel like R. Yosi does! (Why is the Hekesh to Terumah needed?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi teaches only that there is a Lav for such Tevel. The Hekesh teaches that there is Misah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Nachman):</span> The Mishnah cannot be R. Meir!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> A Bas Levi (pregnant from or Mekudeshes to or Shomeres Yavam) to a Kohen, or a Bas Kohen to a Levi may not eat Terumah nor Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since R. Meir permits a Kohen to eat Ma'aser, there is no reason why she may not eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> 'She does not eat (Ma'aser)' means that she cannot authorize separating (Terumas Ma'aser from her husband's Ma'aser).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that after Nisu'in she may authorize!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "You will eat ... and your household" teaches that a Bas Yisrael married to a Levi may authorize separating (Terumas) Ma'aser;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this teaches that she may eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We already know this from a Kal va'Chomer:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Terumah is stringent, yet a Bas Yisrael married to a Kohen may eat it. Ma'aser is lenient, all the more so a Levi's wife may eat it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mar brei d'Ravna):</span> 'She does not eat (Ma'aser)' means that she does receive it (from Yisraelim) at the granaries.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand according to the opinion that the reason why women don't receive at the granaries is because it will lead to seclusion;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, according to the opinion that it is lest she be divorced (and continue to receive), even if a Bas Levi is divorced from a Kohen, she may still eat Ma'aser!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> If a Bas Kohen is divorced (from a Kohen), she is also allowed to eat Terumah (so why does this opinion say that she does not collect while married?)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> You must say that we decree lest a Bas Yisrael continue to collect after she was divorced from a Kohen or a Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even after Nisu'in she should not receive!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is true! Since the Reisha discusses Kidushin, also the Seifa does.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DO <i>KOHANIM </i>RECEIVE <i>MA'ASER</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> Terumah is given to a Kohen, and Ma'aser to a Levi;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Eliezer ben Azaryah says, (it is given) to a Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">86b----------------------------------------86b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is given to a Kohen, but not to a Levi?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, it is even to a Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Akiva's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "To the Leviyim"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Eliezer ben Azaryah holds like R. Yehoshua ben Levi:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> In 24 places, Kohanim are called Leviyim. One of them is "Ha'Kohanim ha'Leviyim Bnei Tzadok".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Akiva says that this cannot apply here, for it says "You will eat it (Ma'aser) in all places". A Kohen cannot eat it in a cemetery.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Eliezer ben Azaryah says, this verse comes to teach that it need not be eaten within the walls of Yerushalayim, and one is not lashed for eating it if he is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Eliezer ben Azaryah used to receive Ma'aser from a certain woman. R. Akiva switched her door to open to a cemetery.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer ben Azaryah:</span> With Akiva around, how will I live?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (It says elsewhere that Leviyim were fined, and others would receive Ma'aser.) Why were the Leviyim fined?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>R. Yonasan and elders argued about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They did not return to Eretz Yisrael (from Bavel) in the days of Ezra.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It was to provide Kohanim with what to eat when they are Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That is no reason to fine the Leviyim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, all agree that the fine was because they did not return with Ezra. They argue about who received Ma'aser as a result of the fine:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1:</span> It was given to the poor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2:</span> A Kohen, when he is Tamei, is like a poor man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that it was given to the poor, we understand why R. Akiva switched the woman's door to the cemetery (rich Kohanim may not take Ma'aser).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, according to the opinion that Kohanim receive it, why did he switch her door?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He told R. Eliezer ben Azaryah 'if you are taking it because of the fine, you are entitled to it. If you believe that mid'Oraisa Kohanim receive it, you are not entitled to it.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that Leviyim did not return with Ezra?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "I did not find a Levi".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Originally, officers were only appointed from Leviyim - "The officers, the Leviyim in front of you";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Today, we only appoint from Yisrael - "The officers of the many in front of you."</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Bas Yisrael married a Kohen, she eats Terumah. If he died and she has a son from him, she eats Terumah;</p>
