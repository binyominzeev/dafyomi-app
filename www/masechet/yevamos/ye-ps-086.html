<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WIDOWS THAT EAT TERUMAH AND MA'ASER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Even a non-Levi may eat Ma'aser!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Meir, who permits Ma'aser Rishon only to Leviyim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Terumah is given to (and eaten by) a Kohen, and Ma'aser to a Levi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer ben Azaryah permits Ma'aser even to a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This implies that someone forbids (a Kohen to eat Ma'aser. This is unreasonable!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> R. Eliezer ben Azaryah permits <i>giving</i> Ma'aser even to a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Meir's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha brei d'Rava citing a tradition):</span> A verse equates Ma'aser Rishon to Terumah to teach that just like Terumah is forbidden to a Zar, so Ma'aser is forbidden to a non-Levi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like a Zar who eats Terumah is Chayav Misah (b'Yedei Shamayim, if he was Mezid) and adds a fifth (when paying for what he b'Shogeg), the same applies to (a non-Levi who eats) Ma'aser!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "They will die for it (Terumah) ... and add a fifth on it" - "for it" and not for Ma'aser; "on it" and not on Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Chachamim say, Ma'aser is equated to Terumah to teach that just like failure to separate Terumah is Tovel (forbids eating the produce), also regarding Ma'aser Rishon:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Beraisa - R. Yosi) Question:</span> One might have thought that one is liable for Tevel only if nothing was separated. What is the source to Mechayev if Terumah was separated, but not Ma'aser Rishon, or Ma'aser Rishon but not Ma'aser Sheni or (even) Ma'aser Oni?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "You cannot eat in your gates" and "They will eat in your gates";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The latter verse refers to Ma'aser Oni. Likewise, the former forbids produce that still 'contains' (i.e. is Tevel to) Ma'aser Oni.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Had we learned only from these verses, one might have thought that eating such Tevel is only a Lav. Ma'aser is equated to Terumah to teach that one is Chayav Misah for it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question:</span> We learn that Ma'aser Rishon is Tovel like R. Yosi does! (Why is the Hekesh to Terumah needed?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi teaches only that there is a Lav for such Tevel. The Hekesh teaches that there is Misah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Nachman):</span> The Mishnah cannot be R. Meir!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> A Bas Levi (pregnant from or Mekudeshes to or Shomeres Yavam) to a Kohen, or a Bas Kohen to a Levi may not eat Terumah nor Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Since R. Meir permits a Kohen to eat Ma'aser, there is no reason why she may not eat!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> 'She does not eat (Ma'aser)' means that she cannot authorize separating (Terumas Ma'aser from her husband's Ma'aser).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that after Nisu'in she may authorize!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "You will eat ... and your household" teaches that a Bas Yisrael married to a Levi may authorize separating (Terumas) Ma'aser;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this teaches that she may eat!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We already know this from a Kal va'Chomer:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Terumah is stringent, yet a Bas Yisrael married to a Kohen may eat it. Ma'aser is lenient, all the more so a Levi's wife may eat it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mar brei d'Ravna):</span> 'She does not eat (Ma'aser)' means that she does receive it (from Yisraelim) at the granaries.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand according to the opinion that the reason why women don't receive at the granaries is because it will lead to seclusion;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, according to the opinion that it is lest she be divorced (and continue to receive), even if a Bas Levi is divorced from a Kohen, she may still eat Ma'aser!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> If a Bas Kohen is divorced (from a Kohen), she is also allowed to eat Terumah (so why does this opinion say that she does not collect while married?)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> You must say that we decree lest a Bas Yisrael continue to collect after she was divorced from a Kohen or a Levi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even after Nisu'in she should not receive!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is true! Since the Reisha discusses Kidushin, also the Seifa does.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DO KOHANIM RECEIVE MA'ASER?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> Terumah is given to a Kohen, and Ma'aser to a Levi;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Eliezer ben Azaryah says, (it is given) to a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">86b----------------------------------------86b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is given to a Kohen, but not to a Levi?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, it is even to a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Akiva's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "To the Leviyim"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Eliezer ben Azaryah holds like R. Yehoshua ben Levi:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> In 24 places, Kohanim are called Leviyim. One of them is "Ha'Kohanim ha'Leviyim Bnei Tzadok".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Akiva says that this cannot apply here, for it says "You will eat it (Ma'aser) in all places". A Kohen cannot eat it in a cemetery.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>R. Eliezer ben Azaryah says, this verse comes to teach that it need not be eaten within the walls of Yerushalayim, and one is not lashed for eating it if he is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>R. Eliezer ben Azaryah used to receive Ma'aser from a certain woman. R. Akiva switched her door to open to a cemetery.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer ben Azaryah:</span> With Akiva around, how will I live?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (It says elsewhere that Leviyim were fined, and others would receive Ma'aser.) Why were the Leviyim fined?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>R. Yonasan and elders argued about this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They did not return to Eretz Yisrael (from Bavel) in the days of Ezra.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It was to provide Kohanim with what to eat when they are Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That is no reason to fine the Leviyim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, all agree that the fine was because they did not return with Ezra. They argue about who received Ma'aser as a result of the fine:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #1:</span> It was given to the poor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #2:</span> A Kohen, when he is Tamei, is like a poor man.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that it was given to the poor, we understand why R. Akiva switched the woman's door to the cemetery (rich Kohanim may not take Ma'aser).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, according to the opinion that Kohanim receive it, why did he switch her door?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He told R. Eliezer ben Azaryah 'if you are taking it because of the fine, you are entitled to it. If you believe that mid'Oraisa Kohanim receive it, you are not entitled to it.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that Leviyim did not return with Ezra?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "I did not find a Levi".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Originally, officers were only appointed from Leviyim - "The officers, the Leviyim in front of you";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Today, we only appoint from Yisrael - "The officers of the many in front of you."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN A WIDOW EATS TERUMAH AND MA'ASER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Bas Yisrael married a Kohen, she eats Terumah. If he died and she has a son from him, she eats Terumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If she (then) married a Levi, she eats Ma'aser. If he died, and she has a son from him, she eats Ma'aser;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If she married a Yisrael, she may not eat Terumah or Ma'aser. If he died and she has a son from him, she may not eat them;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If her son from the Yisrael died, she may eat Ma'aser. If her son from the Levi then died, she may eat Terumah. If her son from the Kohen died, she may not eat Terumah or Ma'aser.</p></div>
