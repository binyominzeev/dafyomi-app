<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ARE WE CONCERNED LEST CHILDREN WERE BORN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a (childless) man went overseas with a wife and left a wife (Leah) home and they told Leah that he died, she may not remarry nor do Yibum until she hears whether or not she, her Tzarah, is pregnant;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If Leah has no Yavam but has a mother-in-law overseas, she need not be concerned lest a Yavam was born;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If her mother-in-law was pregnant and went overseas, Leah must be concerned lest a Yavam was born (she may not remarry);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yehoshua says, she need not be concerned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does it say '<i>she</i>, her Tzarah'? (This is unnecessary!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are concerned only for a Tzarah we know about. We are not concerned lest he married a woman overseas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She may not remarry nor do Yibum ...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, she may not do Yibum. If her Tzarah is pregnant, the Yavam is forbidden mid'Oraisa due to Eshes Ach without the Mitzvah of Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, why can't she remarry? We should assume that the Tzarah is from the majority of women who get pregnant and have children!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mishnah is R. Meir, who is concerned for the minority.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Mishnah can even be as Chachamim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim follow a Ruba d'Isa Kaman (a majority in front of us that we can count it), e.g. if there are nine stores (in this city that sell Kosher meat and one sells Tereifah, and meat was found and we do not know from which store it came);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Also regarding Beis Din (we follow the majority of judges);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We do not find that Chachamim follow a Ruba d'Leisa Kaman (i.e. a statistical majority, e.g. most women get pregnant and have children).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> When a minor falls to Yibum, Chachamim rely on a Ruba d'Leisa Kaman!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A minor Yavam or Yevamah does not do Chalitzah or Yibum;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> We understand why they cannot do Chalitzah. "Ish" must be an adult, and we equate the law of the Yevamah to the Yavam;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Chachamim):</span> Why can't they do Yibum?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Meir):</span> If he is a minor, we are concerned lest he be found to be a Seris. If she is a minor, we are concerned lest she is an Ailonis. In either case (there was no Mitzvah of Yibum, so) they transgressed Ervah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Chachamim rely on the majority. Most people are normal males and females.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must say that our Mishnah is R. Meir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Seifa):</span> If she has no Yavam but has a mother-in-law overseas, she need not be concerned lest a Yavam was born.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Mishnah is R. Meir, we should be concerned!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Most women get pregnant and bear children. A minority miscarry. Of those who bear children, half are male;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The chance that her mother-in-law bore a son is less than half. R. Meir is concerned for a minority!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since Leah's Chazakah is that she will not fall to Yibum when her husband dies, R. Meir is not concerned for the minority.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, in the Reisha her Chazakah is that she will fall to Yibum. She should do Yibum!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> There, to do Yibum is Chayavei Kerisos (if indeed he had a son and Yibum does not apply), so we are concerned. Yevamah l'Shuk (if there is a Yavam) is only Chayavei Lavin, so we are not stringent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Both are mid'Oraisa. We should be as stringent about Chayavei Lavin as we are about Chayavei Kerisos!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">119b----------------------------------------119b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> In the Reisha, her Chazakah is that she will fall to Yibum, and the majority says that she will not. A Chazakah is not as strong as a majority, so it joins with the minority of women who miscarry, and we are left with an even doubt, so she may not do Yibum or marry l'Shuk;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In the Seifa, the Chazakah and the majority both say that she will not fall to Yibum. Therefore, the chance that a Yavam was born is considered miniscule, and even R. Meir is not concerned for this.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MAY SHE DO CHALITZAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Leah may not marry l'Shuk or do Yibum ...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can she never remarry?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ze'iri):</span> She must wait three months to see if she herself is pregnant. She must wait nine months lest her Tzarah is pregnant. After this Leah does Chalitzah, and she is permitted l'Shuk whether or not her Tzarah bore a child.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chanina):</span> She must wait three months to see if she herself is pregnant. She must wait forever for her Tzarah (i.e. until witnesses say whether or not she gave birth)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't Leah do Chalitzah after nine months, whether or not her Tzarah had a child?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye bar Avin and R. Chanina bar Avin):</span> This is a decree, lest the Tzarah had a child, and we will have to announce that the Chalitzah was unnecessary and void, so Leah is permitted to a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is wrong if we need to announce this?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps someone who saw the Chalitzah will not hear the announcement. When he sees her marry a Kohen, he will think that a Chalutzah was permitted to a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman says 'I had a son overseas. My son died, and then my husband', she is believed. If she says 'My husband died, and then my son', she is not believed, and we are concerned for her words. She does Chalitzah, not Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest witnesses come and verify her story, and we will have to announce that she is permitted to a Kohen!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> That Mishnah discusses a divorcee.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chiya brei d'Rav Huna):</span> The case is, she said that she and her husband were alone in a cave. We are not concerned lest witnesses come.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="note"><span>Note:</span> Perhaps she knows the Halachah, and falsely says that they were alone, so we will permit her to do Chalitzah. Later, witnesses will come and verify her story, and she will be permitted to a Kohen! Perhaps she disqualified such witnesses from testifying for her, for according to her, they lie. Indeed, if she disqualifies herself to Kehunah in any way, she may do Chalitzah. The Me'iri connotes like this.</span></p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE TESTIMONY OF YEVAMOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Sarah and Leah were married to two brothers. Each said 'My husband died (without children)'. Leah cannot remarry, lest Sarah's husband (her Yavam) is alive. Likewise, Sarah cannot remarry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If Sarah has witnesses that her husband died, and Leah has no witnesses that her husband died, Sarah may not remarry, but Leah may;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If one man died with children and the other without children, the widow with children may marry. The other widow may not;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If Sarah and Leah did Yibum (to other brothers), and the Yevamim died, the women may not remarry;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Elazar says, since they were permitted to the Yevamim, they are permitted to others.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> If Sarah has witnesses and children, and Leah has neither, both may remarry;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>If (neither had witnesses or children and) they did Yibum and the Yevamim died, they are forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Elazar says, since they were permitted to the Yevamim, they are permitted to others.</p></div>
