<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>IS A MO'AVIS PERMITTED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Doeg asked like above. They were silent. Doeg was about to announce that David was forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Here it says "Amasha, the son of`... Yisra ha'Yisraeli who had Bi'ah with Avigayil Bas Nachash". Elsewhere he is called "Yisra ha'Yishmaeli"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> This teaches that he girded his sword like a Yishmaeli and said 'whoever does not accept my tradition will be pierced with a sword. I learned from Shmuel ha'Navi that an Amoni and a Mo'avi are forbidden, but not an Amonis or Mo'avis.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One is not believed to teach a law in such a case!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> If a Chacham teaches a law relevant to a case at hand (Tosfos - that affects himself), we heed him only if he already taught the law before.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yisra was believed, since Shmuel and his Beis Din were around (the law was easily verifiable).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do'eg's question remains (the women should have gone out to greet the women)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Chachamim of Bavel):</span> "The honor of a Bas Melech is (to stay) inside" (women should not go out even to greet women).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael:</span> We learn this from " ... Where is your wife Sarah?" (It is praiseworthy that she stayed in the tent.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>The following Tana'im also argue about this (the source that a Mo'avis is permitted).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> An Amoni is forbidden, but not an Amonis; a Mo'avi, but not a Mo'avis;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says, "Because they did not go out ..." - it is the way of a man ...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "You opened my binds" - David said to Hash-m, two binds that were on me, you opened - Rus the Mo'avis, and No'oma the Amonis (the mother of Rechavam, who succeeded Shlomo).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "... Your wonders and thoughts are upon <i>us</i>" - not upon me.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This teaches that Rechavam sat in David's lap, and David told him 'these two verses were said for me and you.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Then I said, I have come; it is written in a Sefer about me" - David said, when I was anointed, I thought that my grandeur was just starting; I did not realize, it was already written in the Torah about me.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "that were found" regarding Lot's daughters (who gave birth to Amon and Mo'av), like it says, "I found David my servant".</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE DAUGHTER OF A CONVERTED AMONI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula, citing R. Yochanan):</span> The daughter of a converted Amoni may marry a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava bar Ula):</span> Like whom is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is unlike R. Yehudah, for he says that a convert's daughter is like a Chalal's daughter!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is like R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious! R. Yosi permits even the daughter of two converts to a Kohen!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps that applies to converts that may marry Yisraelim, but not to forbidden converts.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to make such a distinction?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from the daughter of a Kohen Gadol from a widow.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from there, for the Bi'ah is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (This does not cause the Isur!) A Chalal's daughter is forbidden even though the Bi'ah was permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from a Chalal, since he himself was conceived through sin!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Kohen Gadol was not conceived through sin! We may learn from a Tzad ha'Shavah (what is common to both). Each case (a Kohen Gadol married to a widow, and Chalal) has something not found in the other. The common side is that they are unlike the majority of the congregation, and their daughters are forbidden to Kohanim. We learn that the same applies to an Amoni's daughter!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn. A Kohen Gadol to a widow and a Chalal both involve sin (but no sin led to an Amoni's daughter)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava bar Ula):</span> Perhaps you teach about an Amoni who married a Bas Yisrael. Even though Bi'ah is forbidden, the daughter may marry a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> Correct! The following shows that R. Yochanan discussed such a case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravin, citing R. Yochanan):</span> The daughter of a converted Amoni or Mitzri Sheni is permitted (to a Kohen);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> She is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Reish Lakish learns from a Kohen Gadol and a widow.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>The following shows why R. Yochanan permits.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">77b----------------------------------------77b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Zakai - Beraisa):</span> "He will marry a virgin from his nations" - this includes a Mechunah convert (her parents come from the same nation).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1A - R. Yochanan:</span> I expound "<i>me</i>'Amav (<i>from</i> his nations)" to permit a virgin that comes from two nations, and you learn only Mechunah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are the two nations?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> An Amoni married an Amonis. These are considered two nations because the men are permitted and the women are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is like R. Zakai (but R. Yochanan disagreed)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, an Amoni (or Mitzri Sheni) married a Bas Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1B - R. Yochanan:</span> I expound "<i>me</i>'Amav" to permit a virgin that comes from two nations, and one of those nations has in it two nations, and you learn only Mechunah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to this version, how does R. Yochanan learn that a Mitzri Sheni's daughter is permitted? ("Me'Amav" does not discuss Mitzriyim, for it is not like two nations; men and women are forbidden equally.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He learns from an Amoni who married a Bas Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from Amonim, for (even if she were considered an Amonis,) the females are permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The child of a Mitzri Sheni from a Mitzris Shenis is permitted, even though females (Mitzriyos) are forbidden. This shows that this factor is irrelevant!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> There, Bi'ah is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The child of an Amoni from a Bas Yisrael is permitted even though Bi'ah is forbidden! We learn from a Tzad ha'Shavah of these two.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I had heard Rav Yehudah say 'Amav' - "<i>me</i>Amav" and I did not understand. (Now, I understand.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah - (R. Zakai - Beraisa):</span> An Amonis is permitted. Her son from an Amoni is forbidden. Her daughter from an Amoni is permitted (the entire Beraisa will be explained);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This applies after they converted; but her daughter from an Amoni is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Do not teach this in the Beis Medrash!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>I agree that an Amonis is permitted - "Amoni", not an Amonis;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>I agree that her son from an Amoni is forbidden, since he is an Amoni;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> You said 'Her daughter from an Amoni is permitted' - to whom?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It is not to Yisrael. If her mother is permitted, all the more so the daughter (she was born in Kedushah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She is permitted to a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> You said 'This applies after they converted; but her daughter from an Amoni is forbidden' - to what does this refer?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If an Amoni married an Amonis, that is a convert Mechunah (she is Kesherah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, an Amoni married a Bas Yisrael (and you forbid).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Do not teach this in the Beis Medrash (it is wrong)!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>IS A MITZRIS FORBIDDEN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Mitzri or Edomi is forbidden ...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim challenge R. Shimon's Kal va'Chomer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Arayos disprove the Kal va'Chomer. They are forbidden only until three generations (the Torah permits a man to his great granddaughter), yet Arayos through males and females (e.g. the daughters of one's son <i>and</i> daughter) are forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot challenge from Arayos, for they are Chayavei Kerisos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from Mamzerim. Even a Mamzeres is forbidden, even though this is not Chayavei Kerisos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> You cannot learn from Mamzerim, for all generations are forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Tzad ha'Shavah. In Arayos and Mamzerim, both males and females are forbidden. The same applies to Mitzriyim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Tzad ha'Shavah is invalid, since both sources involve Chayavei Kerisos (a Mamzer results from Kares)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (c)):</span> Rather, Chachamim ask from a Chalal who results from Chayavei Aseh, like R. Eliezer ben Yakov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was R. Shimon's answer 'No, rather...'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> I do not hold like R. Eliezer ben Yakov (so I hold that the Kal va'Chomer is valid). You, who (reject the Kal va'Chomer because you) hold like him should know that I have a tradition to permit the females.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> I received my law on tradition. Also, the verse supports me - "Sons" are forbidden, but not daughters.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> "Sons" are forbidden, but not daughters;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, "Banim who will be born to them ..." - the verse ascribes (the Isur) to birth (to the mother. If she were permitted, also her children would be!)</p></div>
