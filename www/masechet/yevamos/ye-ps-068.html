<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THOSE WHO ONLY DISQUALIFY FROM EATIING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A Bas Yisrael Mekudeshes to a Kohen does not eat due to Ula's concern (lest she share Terumah with her siblings).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A Bas Kohen Mekudeshes to a deaf Yisrael is disqualified from eating, since he acquired her mid'Rabanan;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A Bas Yisrael married to a deaf Kohen does not eat. We require "Kinyan Kaspo", and a deaf man cannot acquire.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A nine-year old... (We are thinking that this refers to a Shomeres Yavam to a nine-year old Yavam.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this case teach?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it teaches that he disqualifies her, a Yavam less than nine also disqualifies!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it teaches that he does not permit her, even an adult Yavam does not permit her!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The case is, he did Yibum. Mid'Oraisa, he acquired her;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that since he acquired her mid'Oraisa, and his Bi'ah is considered Bi'ah, he permits her to eat. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim made Bi'ah of a nine-year old Yavam like a Ma'amar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava - Seifa):</span> If we are unsure whether or not he is nine...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a Vadai nine-year old does not permit, we need not teach about a Safek nine-year old!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rather, it teaches that whenever a man disqualifies her through Bi'ah, such a nine-year old also disqualifies her:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following disqualify a Bas Kohen, Bas Levi or Bas Yisrael through Bi'ah: a nine-year old Kusi, Nasin, Chalal, Mamzer, or converted Amoni, Mo'avi, Mitzri or Edomi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Seifa (69a)):</span> If they may not have Bi'ah with a Yisrael, they disqualify.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This implies that the Reisha does not discuss such people!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Reisha discusses men who cannot marry any Yisraelis. The Seifa discusses men who cannot marry a Bas Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MEN WHO DISQUALIFY FROM TERUMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following disqualify a Bas Kohen, Bas Levi or Bas Yisrael through Bi'ah: a nine-year old Kusi, Nasin, Chalal, Mamzer, or converted Amoni, Mo'avi, Mitzri or Edomi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yosi says, only one whose seed is unfit disqualifies;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, a man's widow may marry a Kohen (i.e. he does not disqualify her through Bi'ah) only if his daughter may marry a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> From where do we learn this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> "U'Vas Kohen Ki Sihyeh l'Ish Zar" - once she has Bi'ah with a man forbidden to her, he disqualifies her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That verse teaches that marriage to a Zar forbids her to eat!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is learned from "She will return... she will eat the bread of her father's house";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Return" implies that before (being widowed or divorced from the Yisrael) she could not eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If we learned from "She will return", one would say that only a Lav derived from a Mitzvas Aseh, which is an Aseh, forbids her;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Therefore, "U'Vas Kohen..." teaches that a Lav forbids her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, we learn a Lav from "V'Chol Zar Lo Yochal Kodesh".</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">68b----------------------------------------68b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That verse teaches only about a Zar, but not a Bas Kohen married to a Yisrael!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are two verses "V'Chol Zar".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The other "V'Chol Zar" is needed to teach R. Yosi bar Chanina's law!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> "V'Chol Zar" may not eat Terumah, but an Onen may.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is learned from the extra "V'Chol". (Had the Torah said just "Zar", we would learn only that Bi'as Isur disqualifies.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, we need "U'Vas Kohen" to teach that she returns to eat Terumah, but not Chazeh v'Shok (parts of a Korban Shelamim given to Kohanim)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> "U'Vas Kohen... <i>mi'Srumas</i> ha'Kodoshim Lo Sochal" - from Muram (what is taken) from Kodshim she will not eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the verse came only for this (who disqualifies her), it would have said only "b'Kodoshim". It says "mi'Srumas ha'Kodoshim" to teach both.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ALSO A BAS YISRAEL IS DISQUALIFIED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches that such men disqualify a Bas Kohen. What is the source that they disqualify a Bas Levi and a Bas Yisrael?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn like R. Aba taught (elsewhere), from the extra 'Vav' in "<i>U</i>'Vas".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is only like R. Akiva, who expounds extra Vavim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, even Chachamim could agree here, since the entire verse (the words "U'Vas Kohen") is extra.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches that they become forbidden to eat Terumah. What is the source that they become forbidden to (marry) a Kohen?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Torah taught that a Bas Levi and Bas Yisrael become forbidden. This must be to Kohanim, since they are anyway forbidden to eat Terumah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> They could eat if they had children from a Kohen!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, a Kal va'Chomer teaches that Bi'as Isur forbids them to eat Terumah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Bas Kohen eats because of her intrinsic Kedushah, yet Bi'as Isur forbids her. A Bas Levi or Bas Yisrael lacks intrinsic Kedushah, all the more so Bi'as Isur forbids her!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> To the contrary! A Bas Kohen eats due to her Kedushah, therefore, Bi'as Isur blemishes her Kedushah and disqualifies her. Those whose Heter to eat is not due to their Kedushah are not disqualified!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> A Kal va'Chomer from a divorcee teaches that a Bas Levi and Bas Yisrael become forbidden to Kohanim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A divorcee is permitted to eat Terumah, but is forbidden to Kohanim. All the more so, one who is forbidden to eat Terumah is forbidden to Kohanim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn a Lav (for which one can be lashed) from a Kal va'Chomer!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Kal va'Chomer merely teaches that the Isur to eat Terumah also forbids to Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (What is the source that all the men in the Beraisa disqualify?) Perhaps only Bi'ah of Chayavei Kerisos disqualifies!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ki <i>Sihyeh</i>" connotes Kidushin. There cannot be Kidushin with Chayavei Kerisos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, a Nochri or slave should not disqualify through Bi'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yishmael taught why they disqualify.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yishmael):</span> "A Bas Kohen who was widowed or divorced... (returns to eat Terumah)"  - this applies to men from whom she can be widowed or divorced. A Nochri or slave permanently disqualifies her.</p></div>
