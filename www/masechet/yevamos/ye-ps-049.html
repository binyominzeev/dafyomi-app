<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT MAKES A <i>MAMZER</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> What (Isur between the parents) causes the child to be a Mamzer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Akiva):</span> It is when they are She'er (relatives) forbidden to each other by a Lav;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shimon ha'Temani):</span> It is when there is Kares (for Bi'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Halachah follows him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yehoshua):</span> It is when there is Misas Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Ben Azai):</span> I found a scroll of lineage in Yerushalayim that said 'Ploni is a Mamzer from a married woman'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If a man's wife dies, he may marry her sister. If he divorced her and then she died, he may marry her sister. If she married someone else and died, he may marry her sister.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If a Yevamah died, the Yavam may marry her sister. If he did Chalitzah and she died, he may marry her sister. If she married another man and died, he may marry her sister.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is R. Akiva's source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Lo Yikach Ish Es Eshes Aviv v'Lo Yegaleh Es Kenaf Aviv" - a man will not have Bi'ah with a woman with whom his father had Bi'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva holds like R. Yehudah, who says that this refers to a woman raped by his father, which is a Lav (for the son).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is written next to the Isur of a Mamzer, to teach that such unions produce Mamzerim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Simai says that even Chayavei Lavin not of She'er (produce Mamzerim), and R. Yesheivav includes even Chayavei Aseh. They include these from [the Vov in] "v'Lo".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Shimon ha'Temani holds like Chachamim, that "Kenaf Aviv" refers to a Shomeres Yavam of his father, which is Chayavei Kerisus (since she was his uncle's wife);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Isur of a Mamzer is next to this. This shows that Chayavei Kerisos produce Mamzerim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Yehoshua disagrees, for if so the verse should have mentioned only "Kenaf Aviv". Why does the Reisha of the verse discuss Eshes Av?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, this teaches that Mamzerim result only from Arayos as stringent as Eshes Av (Chayavei Misos) until (but not including) Kenaf Aviv (Chayavei Kerisus).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> All agree that a Mamzer does not result from Bi'ah with a Nidah or a Sotah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">49b----------------------------------------49b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Children of a Nidah are not Mamzerim because the Isur does not inhibit Kidushin;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"U'Sehi Nidasah Alav" - even when she is Nidah, Havayah (Kidushin; Havayah and 'u'Sehi' have the same root) takes effect on her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also the Isur Sotah does not inhibit Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> All agree that the child of a Nidah, Sotah, or a Shomeres Yavam (who conceived from a stranger) is not a Mamzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye did not teach the case of Shomeres Yavam, for he was unsure if the Halachah follows Rav (who says that Ein Kidushin Tofsin to a stranger) or Shmuel (who says that perhaps the verse comes (only) to forbid Bi'ah with a stranger).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Shimon Ben Azai):</span> I found a scroll of lineage in Yerushalayim that said that Ploni is a Mamzer from a married woman;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>The scroll also said that the teachings of R. Eliezer ben Yakov are few but clean (the Halachah always follows him);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>It also said that Menasheh killed Yeshayahu.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHY MENASHE KILLED YESHAYAHU</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> He judged him and killed him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Menasheh:</span> Your Rebbi Moshe said (in the Torah) "A person will not see Me and live", but you said "I saw Hash-m sitting on a lofty throne"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Your Rebbi Moshe said "Who is like Hash-m Elokeinu whenever we call to Him", but you said "Seek Hash-m when He is found"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Your Rebbi Moshe said "I will complete the number of your days", but you said (to my father Chizkiyahu) "I will add 15 years to your days"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Yeshayahu (reasoning to himself):</span> Menasheh will not accept my answers. If I answer, I will make him an intentional sinner!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yeshayahu said a name of Hash-m, and was swallowed into a cedar tree. They brought the tree and were sawing it. When they got to the place of his mouth, he died, because he had said (earlier) "I dwell among a people of unclean lips".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can we resolve Menasheh's questions?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (for "I saw Hash-m" - Beraisa):</span> All (other) Nevi'im saw Hash-m through a glass that distorts; Moshe saw through a clear glass (Rashi - only Moshe realized that he did not really see Hash-m).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (for "Seek Hash-m when He is found"):</span> Hash-m is always found to a congregation, but not always to an individual.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is He found to an individual?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> He is found during the 10 days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kipur.</p>
