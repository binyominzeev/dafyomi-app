<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHICH SHOES ARE VALID FOR <i>CHALITZAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rava - Beraisa):</span> In the following cases Chalitzah is valid:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The shoe was a torn Min'al that covers most of the foot, an incomplete sandal that holds most of the foot, a sandal of rubber or bark, a false foot (in which the leg rests), in a felt shoe, a carpet for the legs of an amputee (his ligaments constricted and he cannot straighten his legs; he propels himself with his hands and drags his legs), or a leather Anpilya;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Yavam is an adult;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Yavam was standing, sitting or leaning;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The Yavam is blind.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>In the following cases Chalitzah is invalid:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The shoe was a torn Min'al that does not cover most of the foot, an incomplete sandal that does not hold most of the foot, a carpet for an amputee's hands, or a cloth Anpilya;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The Yavam is a minor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This Tana holds that a false foot is like a shoe. Who is the Tana?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Meir:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> A person with a false foot may walk outside with it (on Shabbos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi forbids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa invalidates Chalitzah with a cloth Anpilya. This is like Chachamim (who argue with R. Meir, and require leather)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Since the Seifa is Chachamim, also the Reisha is. The case is, the false foot is covered with leather.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> This implies that if it is not covered with leather, it is invalid. If so, why does the Seifa invalidate a cloth Anpilya? It should distinguish between different kinds of false feet!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It should say that a false foot is valid only if it is covered with leather!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rather, since the Reisha is R. Meir, also the Seifa is. A false foot protects; a cloth Anpilya does not protect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> The Yavam must press his foot on the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi - Beraisa):</span> Chalitzah is valid whether he stands, sits or leans.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> In all three cases, he presses his foot down.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> If one's foot is reversed (his leg rests on the front of his foot), he may not do Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi - Beraisa):</span> Chalitzah with a carpet for an amputee's feet is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The amputee himself does Chalitzah (even though his legs are bent)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, a healthy person may use the carpet for Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> According to Ameimar, Bar Uva and Bar Kifuf (men whose feet were reversed) may not do Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ON WHICH PART OF THE LEG IS <i>CHALITZAH</i> DONE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> From the knee and below (the Chalitzah is valid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> "Regalim" excludes one with a false foot (from the obligation to enter the Mikdash on festivals. This shows that the shin is not called 'Regel'!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The shin is valid for Chalitzah, since the Torah said "me'Al (from above) his foot".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even above the knee should be valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "me'Al", but not 'me'Al of me'Al'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This teaches that there is no bone below the ankle. If there was, the ankle would be called 'me'Al', and the entire leg would be 'me'Al of me'Al'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> Even if there is a bone underneath, whatever is even with the foot is considered part of the foot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Above the knee (is Pasul).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> "And the fetal sac that comes out from between Ragleha" (shows that "Regel" extends above the knee)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> A woman puts her heels by her thighs when giving birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Lo Osah Raglav (he did not remove the hair by the Ervah)".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a euphemism (to avoid explicit mention of the area. Normally, Regel does not include above the knee.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yavo Sha'ul le'Hasech Es Raglav" (to defecate; alternatively to urinate).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a euphemism.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Ach Mesich Hu Raglav..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a euphemism.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE GOOD OF <i>RESHA'IM</i> IS EVIL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Sisera had Bi'ah seven times - "Between Ragleha he crouched, he fell, he lied; between Ragleha he crouched, he fell; where he crouched, he fell and was killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ya'el benefited from Bi'as Isur (why is she blessed "mi'Nashim ba'Ohel", i.e. the Imahos?)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The good that wicked do is bad for Tzadikim. We learn from "Beware, do not speak to Yakov good nor evil";</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">103b----------------------------------------103b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, Lavan should not speak evil to him. However, why shouldn't he speak (about doing) good to him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The good of Resha'im is bad for Tzadikim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, if Lavan would speak of good, he would mention idolatry. However, what was bad about Sisera's Bi'ah with Ya'el?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He cast filth into her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> When the Nachash had Bi'ah with Chavah, he cast filth into her. When Yisrael stood on Har Sinai, the filth left them. Nochrim did not stand on Har Sinai, so they still have the filth.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE SHOE FOR <i>CHALITZAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she did Chalitzah with a shoe that is not the Yavam's ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Na'alo" teaches only the Yavam's shoe. "Na'al" is repeated to include any man's shoe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what do we learn from "Na'alo"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The shoe must be fitting for him. This excludes a big shoe that he cannot walk in, a small shoe that does not cover the majority of his foot, and a shoe missing the heel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A Yevamah came to do Chalitzah. Rav Yosef told Abaye to give the Yavam his shoe; Abaye gave him his left shoe.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Chalitzah with a left shoe is valid b'Di'eved. It may not be used l'Chatchilah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> The same applies to a shoe that is not the Yavam's!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I intended that you should let the Yavam acquire your shoe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A wooden sandal (is valid for Chalitzah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is our Tana, who holds that a shoe can be of wood?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> It is R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> An amputee may walk outside on Shabbos with a false foot;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi forbids this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel's father):</span> Our Mishnah discusses a wooden sandal covered with leather. All agree that it is a shoe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papi citing Rava):</span> A shoe with Tzara'as that is Musgar (it has not brought Simanim of absolute Tum'ah) may not be used for Chalitzah. If it was used, the Chalitzah is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A shoe that (brought Simanim and) was Muchlat may not be used for Chalitzah. If it was used, the Chalitzah is invalid. (Since it must be burned, it is considered to be too small.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa citing Rava):</span> In either case it may not be used for Chalitzah, but if it was used, the Chalitzah is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> A Musgar house is Metamei whatever touches it internally. A Muchlat house is Metamei even what touches it externally. One who enters either of them becomes Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rav Papi, here also we should say that (a Muchlat house is not the proper size so) we cannot apply "One who enters the house (becomes Tamei)"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is different. "He will take apart the house" teaches that even when it is being destroyed it is called a house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Papi - Beraisa):</span> If a rag with Tzara'as is (at least) three fingers by three fingers, even if its volume is less than a k'Zayis (olive), once the majority enters the house, it is Metamei all Kelim in the house.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This discusses a Muchlat rag.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, it was only Musgar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Seifa):</span> If its volume was several k'Zeisim, once a k'Zayis enters the house, it is Metamei Kelim in the house.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, if it is Muchlat, it is equated to a Mes (a k'Zayis of a corpse is Metamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, if it is only Musgar, why is it equated to a Mes?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Indeed, it was Muchlat. "He will burn the garment" teaches that even when it is being burned, it is called a garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we learn from this (that a Muchlat shoe is called a shoe and is valid for Chalitzah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not learn about Isurim from laws of Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a shoe was Musgar or Muchlat or of idolatry (people put it on an idol), it may not be used for Chalitzah. If it was used, the Chalitzah is valid.</p>
