<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ORDER OF THE <i>MISHNAH</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We must expound to learn about all the Arayos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Granted, we must expound to learn about Yibum (that they are exempt and that they exempt the Tzarah), but the Isur (even not in a situation of Yibum) of the other Arayos is explicit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Isur of Bito is known only through expounding.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We learn the Isur of Bito through (Gezeirah Shavah,) "Henah-Henah" and "Zimah-Zimah".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Tana prefers what is learned by expounding, the case of Achos Ishto (for which the law of Yibum is most explicit) should be taught last!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Once the Tana started listing sisters, he also taught Achos Ishto.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, let him teach sisters at the end!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to question 3a, Daf 2b):</span> Rather, we teach the closest relatives first.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>First we teach about the Yavam's own relatives, i.e. Bito, his daughter's daughter and his son's daughter;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>After teaching about three generations below him, we teach about three generations below his wife;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>After three generations below his wife, we teach about three generations above his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>We then teach about his sister and maternal aunt, which are his own relatives.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Once we discuss sisters, we teach about Achos Ishto.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It would have been proper to teach about his daughter-in-law before Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo, since the latter is not forbidden because of her closeness to Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>However, once we list fraternal Isurim, we include Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE EXEMPTION FROM <i>YIBUM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Tana say that she exempts her Tzaros from Yibum and Chalitzah? She forbids her Tzaros!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Had he said that she forbids Yibum, we would have thought that Chalitzah is required.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> He could have said that she (also) forbids Chalitzah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should Chalitzah be forbidden (even if it is not needed)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If we allow Chalitzah (when it is unnecessary and Yibum is permitted), perhaps people will come to do Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Since the Tzarah is forbidden only regarding Yibum, but is permitted when there is no Mitzvah, we taught 'she exempts'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must it say that she exempts from Chalitzah and Yibum? It suffices to say that she exempts from Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, we would have thought that she does Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it teaches that whoever is obligated to do Yibum may do Chalitzah (instead), and whoever may not do Yibum does not do Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah should (list the primary Mitzvah first and) say that she exempts from Yibum and Chalitzah. Alternatively, it should just say that she exempts from Chalitzah (and obviously, from Yibum)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is like Aba Sha'ul, who says that Chalitzah is preferable to Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CASES EXCLUDED FROM THE <i>MISHNAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Twice, the Mishnah says that there are 15 cases. What other possibilities does it come to exclude?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">3b----------------------------------------3b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It excludes (a Sotah and Ailonis,) the cases of Rav and Rav Asi (Daf 11a and 12a. Our Tana agrees that they do not do Yibum, but he holds that they do not exempt their Tzaros.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav and Rav Asi (who say that they exempt their Tzaros), what two cases are excluded?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> If each agrees to the law of his colleague, we exclude the Tzaros of Mema'enes (a Mema'enes) and of Machazir Gerushaso (a woman who transgressed and remarried her ex-husband after marrying someone else in between).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Rav and Rav Asi disagree with each other, each excludes the case of his colleague and Tzaras Mema'enes or Tzaras Machazir Gerushaso.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav and Rav Asi, why didn't the Mishnah list their cases?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is because Tzaras Tzarah does not apply in their cases. (Sotah and Ailonis are forbidden to all the brothers, so their Tzaros cannot do Yibum with any brother.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE SOURCE OF THE LAW OF THE <i>MISHNAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of the law of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa) Question:</span> What do we learn from "V'Ishah El Achosah Lo Sikach Litzror (to be a Tzarah) Legalos Ervasah <i>Aleha</i> b'Chayehah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Yevamah Yavo Aleha". One might have thought that this applies to Arayos (i.e. if his brother's wife was related to him in an additional way, e.g. Bito);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Gezeirah Shavah teaches just like "Yevamah Yavo Aleha" discusses Yibum, also the Isurim of Arayos apply even in a case of Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This forbids Yibum with Arayos. How do we know that Yibum with Tzaras Ervah is also forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Litzror" (to include Tzaros).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the Tzarah of the Tzarah is forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Litzror" instead of  'Latzor' (the extra 'Reish' comes to include).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about when the Yevamah is the sister of the Yavam's wife. How do we know that this applies to other Arayos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Achos Ishto is Arayos punishable by Kares (b'Mezid) and Chatas (b'Shogeg) and she may not do Yibum. All such Arayos may not do Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This forbids the Arayos to do Yibum. What is the source to forbid their Tzaros?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Achos Ishto is Ervah punishable by Kares and Chatas, and she and her Tzarah may not do Yibum. The same applies to all such Arayos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>This is the source that the 15 cases of the Mishnah exempt the Tzaros, Tzaros of the Tzaros, ad infinitum from Chalitzah and Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the six Arayos (of the Mishnah 13A) which are more stringent should also exempt the Tzaros!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Shimon's Achos Ishto was able to marry his brother. We do not learn to the six Arayos that cannot marry any (paternal) brother of Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because the law of a Tzarah applies only to co-wives of a brother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This forbids Yibum. Where do we know the punishment if they do Yibum?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "All that do any of these abominations... (will get Kares)".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>AN <i>ASEH</i> OVERRIDES A <i>LAV</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had the Torah not written "Aleha" to forbid Yibum with Achos Ishto, we would permit Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> An Aseh is Docheh (overrides) a Lav. (Additional answers will be given starting on Daf 7a. Answers to Question #1 (below) begin on Daf 5b.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> This applies only to a plain Lav, but not to a Lav punishable by Kares!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> What is the source that an Aseh overrides a plain Lav?</p>
