<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN MAY THE SUSPECTED ADULTERESS STAY MARRIED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If a peddler leaves the house and the woman of the house is putting on a Sinar (undershorts worn for Tzeni'us), this is horrible (surely, she removed them to have Bi'ah), so she must be divorced;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The same applies if (a peddler leaves and) spit is found on the (under side of the) canopy over the bed (surely, she spat while lying down during Bi'ah), or shoes are found upside-down under the bed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We should check whose shoes they are (before requiring divorce)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, footprints made by upside-down shoes are found under the bed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The Halachah follows Rav and the Halachah follows Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is a contradiction!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Regarding a horrible matter,) when there are unceasing rumors he must divorce her even though there are no witnesses, like Rebbi. When the rumors cease, he must divorce her only if there are witnesses like Rav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are considered rumors that do not cease?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is if they last a day and a half.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they ceased before, that is cessation;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they ceased because people fear the suspected party, this is not cessation.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This is only if the suspected one has no enemies in the city. If he has enemies, we attribute the rumors to his enemies (and she may stay married).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one divorced his wife due to bad reports about her, or because of a vow she took, he may not remarry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar Huna):</span> If he married her, must he divorce her?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Rav Nachman - Mishnah):</span> If one was suspected of Bi'ah with a married woman, and they made her husband divorce her, even if the suspected man married her, he must divorce her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rabah bar Huna):</span> That is no proof. There, Beis Din forced the original husband to divorce her. I ask about when he chose to divorce her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah bar Rav Nachman's text of our Mishnah said 'He (willingly) divorced her'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Still, the cases are different! The Mishnah teaches that the adulterer must divorce her. Rabah bar Rav Huna asked whether or not the original husband may keep her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The comparison is valid. The Mishnah forbids the adulterer to marry her, if he did, he must divorce her. The same applies to her first husband!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> When the adulterer marries her, he supports the rumors. If her husband keeps her, people will think that he investigated and found that the rumors were unfounded.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE WHO PERMITTED A WOMAN MAY NOT MARRY HER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one brought a Get (document of divorce) from overseas and said 'It was written and signed in front of me', he may not marry the woman. (There was an enactment that this declaration validates the Get.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a man says 'Leah's husband died', 'I killed him' or 'we killed him', he may not marry her;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, if he says 'I killed him', she may not remarry. If he says 'We killed him', she may marry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> Because he brought the Get from overseas and we rely on his declaration, he may not marry her. Had he brought it from within Eretz Yisrael, where we need not rely on him, he could marry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When he says that her husband died he may not marry her, even though we do not rely on him. We rely on her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learned that a woman checks carefully (that he really died) before remarrying.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, there is nothing written (supporting his words). Here, there is a written Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The difference between divorce and death is that the Get proves that he is telling the truth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he says 'He died', 'I killed him' or 'we killed him', he may not marry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He may not marry her, but others may.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Yosef taught that if Shimon says 'Ploni forcibly raped me', Shimon may join a second witness to condemn Ploni to death;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he says 'I willingly had homosexual relations with Ploni', Shimon is a Rasha - " Al Tashes Yadcha Im Rasha Lihyos Ed Chamas" (he is Pasul for testimony).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Edus Ishah (testimony to permit a widow to remarry) is different, for Chachamim were lenient.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">25b----------------------------------------25b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav Menasheh taught that a thief mid'Rabanan is Kosher for Edus Ishah, but a thief mid'Oraisa is not. Must we say that Rav Menasheh holds like R. Yehudah (unlike Chachamim)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Menasheh can hold like Chachamim; she may marry because of Rava's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A person cannot establish himself to be a Rasha (and disqualify himself from testifying) because he is related to himself (relatives cannot testify).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav Yosef holds like R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Yosef can hold like Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He says that we are more lenient regarding Edus Ishah than about normal testimony. Rav Menasheh holds like R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> 'I killed him'...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is different if he says 'I killed him' or 'We killed him'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> The case is, he said 'I was with those who killed him'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chachamim):</span> A case occurred in which a bandit was walking to his execution. He said 'tell Shimon's wife that I killed her husband', and they permitted her to marry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> That is no proof - he said 'I was with those that killed him'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says that he was a bandit!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was arrested among bandits.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It says that he was going to be executed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Courts of Nochrim execute people without being so careful.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN ONE MAY MARRY THE WOMAN HE PERMITTED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Chacham forbade a woman to her husband due to a vow (he was unable to permit it), he may not marry her. If she did Mi'un or Chalitzah in front of him he may marry her, since he was part of a Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> Had he permitted the vow, he could marry her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion #1:</span> The Chacham was alone.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Chiya bar Avin taught that three judges are needed to permit vows!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion #2:</span> He was among three.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, he is not suspected!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> if she did Mi'un or Chalitzah in front of him, he can marry her, since he was part of a Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he was alone.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> An expert judge can permit vows alone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she did Mi'un or Chalitzah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He can marry her because he was part of a Beis Din, but if there were only two, he could not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different than the following?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If witnesses signed on the sale of a field, or a Get, Chachamim were not concerned (lest they testified falsely).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches that a Beis Din of three is required for Mi'un and Chalitzah, unlike the opinion that says that two suffice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If she married (the Chacham who forbade her due to a vow; Rashi - or the Shali'ach who brought her Get), must he divorce her?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Kahana):</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi and Rav Zuti):</span> He need not divorce her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rabanan (to Rav Zuti):</span> Did you hear that this is the Halachah, or is this your reasoning?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rav Zuti:</span> We learn this from the Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was suspected of Bi'ah with a slave or Nochris and she was freed or converted, he may not marry her. If he married her, he need not divorce her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We do not make him divorce her due to concern lest people talk. The same applies here.</p>
