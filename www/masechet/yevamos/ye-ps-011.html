<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p><i>KIDUSHIN</i> AFTER <i>CHALITZAH</i> (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rav Ashi holds like Reish Lakish, and answered the question according to R. Shimon. Ravina holds like R. Yochanan, and answered the question like Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The Reisha said that if the Choletz was Mekadesh the Choletzes (and he died), she needs Chalitzah from the brothers. This refers to brothers who were born later. It is like R. Shimon (who permits Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo. She may not do Yibum, for she was forbidden to her husband, all the more so to her Yavam - Tosfos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Seifa says that if a brother was Mekadesh her, she has no claim against him. This refers to a brother who was already born, like Reish Lakish taught.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ravina):</span> The Reisha says that if the Choletz was Mekadesh the Choletzes, she needs Chalitzah from the brothers. This refers to brothers who were already born, like R. Yochanan taught.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Seifa says that if a brother was Mekadesh her, she has no claim against him. This refers to brothers who were born later. It is like Chachamim (who argue with R. Shimon).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha or Ravina):</span> If a man did Yibum, then a brother did Yibum with a Tzarah, the second marriage is forbidden with Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Acha and Ravina):</span> It is only Chayavei Aseh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The opinion that is Mechayev Kares holds like Reish Lakish. The opinion that it is only an Aseh holds like R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE TZARH OF A SOTAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Tzarah of a Sotah is forbidden (and even exempt from Chalitzah). She is called Tamei, like Arayos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda - Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> Bi'ah or Chalitzah (of a Sotah) with a brother exempts her Tzarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav discusses a Sotah mid'Oraisa, but the Mishnah explicitly discusses a 'Sotah mid'Rabanan' (a woman who remarried in the life of her husband after one witness testified that her husband died. She did not intend to sin, but she is fined because she did not check well that he really died.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The answer is obvious. Why did Rav Chisda ask?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that Rabbinic enactments are made similar to Torah law.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> If she was secluded (with the man she was warned about) long enough to have Bi'ah, she is forbidden to her husband and forbidden to eat Terumah. If her husband dies, she does Chalitzah but not Yibum. (Rav exempts even her Tzarah from Chalitzah!)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav discusses a Vadai Sotah (she definitely had Bi'ah). The Mishnah discusses a Safek Sotah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he say that a Vadai Sotah is different because she is called Tamei? Also a Safek Sotah is called Tamei!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ben Kipar):</span> If a man was Machazir Gerushaso from Nisuin (divorced his wife and remarried her after she fully remarried and was widowed or divorced from her new husband), he is forbidden to her. If she merely was Mekudeshes to someone else, she is permitted - "Acharei Asher Hutama'ah";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim forbid in both cases. "Acharei Asher Hutama'ah" refers to a Sotah that was in seclusion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'Seclusion' is a euphemism for Zenus (but a Safek Sotah is not called Tamei).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If she was Mezaneh, Tum'ah is explicitly written (in Parashas Sotah itself) - "V'Nisterah v'Hi Nitma'ah"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Acharei Asher Hutama'ah" forbids her with a Lav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi ben Kipar holds that there is no Lav regarding a Sotah, even if she was Mezaneh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is because "Kidushin" and "marriage" are written (regarding Machazir Gerushaso (Rashi) or "Acharei Asher Hutama'ah (Tosfos), therefore we do not include Zenus).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>YIBUM AFTER THE DEATH OF A MACHAZIR GERUSHASO</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda):</span> If a man was Machazir Gerushaso after she remarried and he died, what is the law of her Tzarah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> We do not ask according to R. Yosi ben Kipar. Since Tum'ah is written regarding Machazir Gerushaso (she is like Ervah, so), her Tzarah is like her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "To'evah <i>Hi</i>" teaches that she is an abomination, but her Tzarah is permitted (to do Yibum)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. "Hi" excludes her children (they are Kesherim), but her Tzarah is also To'evah (forbidden to do Yibum).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The question is according to Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even though they say that Tum'ah written regarding Machazir Gerushaso refers to a Sotah, the simple meaning of the verse is not uprooted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps once it is uprooted, it is entirely uprooted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> We do not ask according to Chachamim. Once the verse is uprooted, it is entirely uprooted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We ask according to R. Yosi ben Kipar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Even though it says Tum'ah regarding Machazir Gerushaso, it says "To'evah Hi". She is To'evah, but her Tzarah is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Or, perhaps she is To'evah, but her children are not. However, her Tzarah is also To'evah. (End of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes - Mishnah):</span> If one widow was Kesherah and the other Pesulah, if he does Chalitzah, he does it with the Pesulah. If he does Yibum, he does it with the Kesherah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Kesherah and Pesulah refer to?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>They cannot mean permitted and forbidden to all (Kohanim, and the Yavam is a Yisrael). Since she is permitted to him, it makes no difference to him!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, it means permitted and forbidden to him, i.e. the dead brother. He was Machazir Gerushaso, and the Mishnah permits Yibum with the Tzarah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2):</span> Really, they mean permitted and forbidden to Kohanim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even though it makes no difference to him, Rav Yosef taught that one should not spill out water that others could use. (He should not do Chalitzah to the widow permitted to Kohanim, since this would forbid her to Kohanim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If one was Machazir Gerushaso after she married, she and her Tzarah do Chalitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must mean that she <i>or</i> her Tzarah does Chalitzah. (This answers our question.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> In any case the Beraisa must be corrected. We can correct it to say that she may do only Chalitzah, but her Tzarah may do Chalitzah or Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question (R. Yochanan):</span> If one was Machazir Gerushaso after she married, what is the law of her Tzarah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Ami:</span> Why don't you ask about her?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Her law is clear from a Kal va'Chomer:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>She became forbidden to the one she was permitted to (her husband). All the more so she is forbidden to the one she was forbidden to (the Yavam)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He asks about her Tzarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Is the Kal va'Chomer strong enough to forbid the Tzarah, or not?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rav Nachman - Question (R. Yochanan):</span> If one was Machazir Gerushaso after she remarried, what is her law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Ami:</span> Why don't you ask about her Tzarah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> The law of her Tzarah is clear. The Kal va'Chomer is not strong enough to forbid the Tzarah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The question is regarding her. Is the Kal va'Chomer strong enough to block the Mitzvah of Yibum, or not?</p></div>
