<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FINES WHEN HER HUSBAND RETURNS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she is a Bas Yisrael, she is disqualified from Kehunah ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is that a Bas Levi is disqualified from Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Forbidden Bi'ah does not disqualify a Bas Levi from Ma'aser!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Bas Levi was taken captive or had Bi'as Zenus, she receives Ma'aser and may eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> This is a fine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Bas Kohen is disqualified from Terumah ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>She is disqualified even from Terumah mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The heirs of either man do not inherit her Kesuvah ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah already said that she has no Kesuvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Here it refers to Kesuvas Bnin Dichrim (that her sons should receive her dowry).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we fine only her, since she sinned, but not her children. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If either man dies, his brothers do Chalitzah, but not Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first man's brothers do Chalitzah mid'Oraisa; mid'Rabanan, they may not do Yibum. The second man's brothers do Chalitzah mid'Rabanan; they do not do Yibum mid'Oraisa or mid'Rabanan. (I.e. mid'Rabanan she is forbidden to the brothers.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> She receives her Kesuvah from the first husband ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The latter Tana'im in the Mishnah agree to the laws of the earlier Tana'im, but the earlier Tana'im argue with the laws of the latter Tana'im:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon admits to R. Eliezer's law. R. Shimon does not fine her regarding Bi'ah, the primary Isur (she may do Yibum). All the more so, he does not fine her regarding Metzi'os and earnings, which are monetary!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer argues with R. Shimon's law. R. Eliezer does not fine her regarding Metzi'os and earnings, which are monetary, but he fines Bi'ah, which is an Isur.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Both of them admit to R. Yosi's law. They do not fine her regarding Metzi'os and earnings, which apply when she is with her husband. All the more so they do not fine her regarding Kesuvah, which she receives when she leaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yosi argues with their laws. He does not fine Kesuvah, which she receives when she leaves, but he fines Metzi'os and earnings, which apply when she is with him (and all the more so Yibum, which is Isur).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The earlier Tana'im agree to the laws of the latter Tana'im, but the latter Tana'im argue with laws of the earlier Tana'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi admits to R. Eliezer's law. The Kesuvah is given from him to her, and R. Yosi does not fine this. All the more so he does not fine her Metzi'os and earnings, which go from her to him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer argues with R. Yosi's law. Metzi'os and earnings, which go from her to him, he fines, but not the Kesuvah, which is from him to her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Both of them agree to R. Shimon. Kesuvah, Metzi'os and earnings, which apply during his lifetime, they do not fine, and all the more so Yibum, which is after his death!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Shimon argues with them. Yibum, which is after his death, he does not fine, but he fines Metzi'os and earnings and Kesuvah, which apply during his lifetime.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN TWO WITNESSES LIED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she remarried without permission (but rather, according to two witnesses) ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna citing Rav):</span> This is the Halachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman):</span> Why do you speak deceptively (as if all agree to this)?! If you hold like R. Shimon, say that the Halachah follows R. Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He did not say so, for this would connote that the Halachah follows R. Shimon also in the Reisha (when married according to one witness, Yibum or Chalitzah by brothers of the first husband exempts the Tzarah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He should have said that the Halachah follows R. Shimon's second law!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes):</span> Rav must have been dozing when he said this! 'This is the Halachah' implies that others argue (and forbid her to the first husband). What did she do wrong (that she should be fined)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Strengthening of Question (Rav Sheshes):</span> A Beraisa proves that Chachamim agree with R. Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> All Arayos (who married) do not require a Get, except for an Eshes Ish was married according to Beis Din (i.e. based on one witness).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If she married according to two witnesses, no Get is needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Beraisa is like R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Shimon does not require a Get when she married according to Beis Din!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Shimon):</span> Beis Din considers (one who remarried b'Isur due to) their ruling like a man and a (married) woman who had Bi'ah with intent (i.e. Mezid. She is forbidden to her husband);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she remarried based on witnesses (and her husband returned), this is like a man and a (married) woman who had Bi'ah without intent (b'Shogeg. She is permitted to her husband.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A Get is not required in either case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Beraisa #1 must be Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, Chachamim argue with R. Shimon. Beraisa #1 is R. Shimon. We must explain Beraisa #2 differently:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Explanation #1 (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Beis Din made their ruling like a man who had Bi'ah with a (single) woman with intent (for Kidushin). She needs a Get (to marry someone else);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she remarried (b'Isur) based on witnesses, this is like a man who had Bi'ah with a (single) woman without intent (for Kidushin). She does not need a Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Explanation #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The Beraisa discusses only when she is forbidden to her husband, like we explained above (h:1,2). It does not discuss the need for a Get:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Beis Din made their ruling like a man and a (married) woman who were Mezid. She is forbidden to her husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If she married based on witnesses, this is like a man and a (married) woman who were Shogeg. She is permitted to her husband.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">91b----------------------------------------91b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Explanation #3 (Ravina):</span> The Beraisa teaches only about when a Korban is required:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Beis Din made (people who transgressed through) their ruling like a man and a (married) woman who had Bi'ah b'Mezid; they do not bring a Korban;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>A woman who remarried (b'Isur) based on witnesses is like a man and a (married) woman who had Bi'ah b'Shogeg; they bring a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Really, Beraisa #1 is Chachamim, but it must be understood differently:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Arayos do not require a Get, except for a married woman who remarried based on (two witnesses or) a ruling of Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IN WHAT CASES DO WE FINE FOR NEGLIGENCE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ula, against Rav Sheishes above (2:e):</span> We do fine even when she is blameless!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any of the following invalidates a Get:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It was dated counting from the (start of) the reign of Rome, Persia, Greece, or the building or destruction of the Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It was written in the east (of the city), but it says that it was written in the west, or vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a woman remarried based on such a Get, she may not remain married to either husband, and all the fines (of our Mishnah 87b) apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> She is fined even when she is blameless!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She is to blame. She should have read the Get [in front of a Chacham, who would have told her that it is Pasul]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Simi bar Ashi - Mishnah):</span> If Leah did Yibum and then her Tzarah Sarah married (a stranger), and then we learned that Leah is an Ailonis (so Sarah was forbidden to marry), Sarah must leave her husband (or Yavam, if she later did Yibum), and all the fines apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sarah is fined even though she is blameless!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, she is to blame. She should have waited (to see if Leah is an Ailonis).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> If Leah was Ervah to the Yavam and her Tzarah Sarah married (a stranger), and then we learned that Leah is an Ailonis (so Sarah was forbidden to marry), she must leave her husband (or Yavam), and all the fines apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She is fined even though she is blameless!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, she is to blame. She should have waited!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> A scribe wrote a Get for a man, and a receipt (for payment of the Kesuvah) for his wife. By mistake, he gave to her the Get and gave to him the receipt. Each gave the document he or she received to the other. The mistake was realized only after she remarried (she has the receipt and her husband has the Get). She may not remain married to either husband, and all the fines apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She is fined even though she is blameless!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, she is to blame. She should have read the Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> If any of the following was changed on a Get, it is invalid: his or her name, or the name of his or her city;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a woman remarried based on such a Get, she may not remain married to either husband, and all the fines apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She is fined even though she is blameless!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, she is to blame. She should have read the Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina - Mishnah):</span> If he gave her a Get Kare'ach (a special type of tied Get which Chachamim enacted, but it lacks the required number of witnesses) ... she may not remain married to either husband ...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She is fined even though she is blameless!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, she is to blame. She should have read the Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Rav Papa was about to permit a woman to return to her husband, because she was blameless.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> All these Mishnayos show that we fine her anyway!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> We answered that in all of them, she was to blame!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Huna):</span> Will we rely on these answers?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Rav Papa refrained. (He did not permit her.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>PERMISSION OF <i>BEIS DIN</i> TO REMARRY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> (If a woman remarried according to Beis Din,) we are not concerned for rumors (that her husband is still alive).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What sort of rumors does he discuss?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot be rumors that began after Nisu'in, for he already taught this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> We are not concerned for rumors that started after marriage.</p>
