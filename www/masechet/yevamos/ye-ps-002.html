<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>ARAYOS</i> THAT UPROOT <i>YIBUM</i> AND <i>CHALITZAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (Normally, if Reuven died without children, one of his brothers must do Yibum (Levirate marriage) or Chalitzah with one of the widows). If a widow (Esther) is forbidden to a brother (Shimon) by one of the 15 Arayos (forbidden incestuous relationships) listed below, she and all her Tzaros (co-wives) are exempt from (and cannot do) Yibum or Chalitzah with him. (If there is no brother with whom they can do Yibum or Chalitzah, they are permitted to marry strangers.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Levi (another brother) did Yibum with Miryam (a Tzarah of Esther) and then he died (childless), all Levi's widows are exempt from Yibum or Chalitzah with Shimon. (Miryam's Tzaros are Tzaros of the Tzarah of Esther.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The same applies if another brother then did Yibum with a widow of Levi and then died childless, ad infinitum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The 15 Arayos are:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shimon's daughter;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The daughter of his daughter;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The daughter of his son;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The daughter of Shimon's wife;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>The daughter of the son of his wife;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>The daughter of the daughter of his wife;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>His mother-in-law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>The mother of his mother-in-law</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>The mother of his father-in-law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>His maternal sister.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span>His mother's sister;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span>His wife's sister;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span>The wife of his maternal brother;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span>Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo (the widow of a brother of Shimon who died before Shimon was born).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">15.</span>Shimon's daughter-in-law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If any of these died, did Mi'un (annulled a mid'Rabanan marriage), was divorced, or was found to be an Ailonis (a girl who does not develop like a normal female), the Tzaros are permitted (i.e. obligated to do Yibum or Chalitzah with Shimon or another brother).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Mi'un and being found to be an Ailonis do not apply to the mother and grandmothers of Shimon's wife. (Mi'un must be before adulthood, and a minor cannot gave birth. An Ailonis is sterile.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>EXEMPTING THE <i>TZAROS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Mishnah):</span> We illustrate the case of Tzaros of a Tzarah. If Shimon's daughter (or any of the other 14 Arayos) Esther was married to Reuven, and Reuven died, just like Esther is exempt (from Yibum with Shimon), so is her Tzarah (Miryam).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Miryam married (i.e. did Yibum) with Levi, the husband of Tamar, and Levi died, just like Miryam is exempt from Yibum with Shimon, so is Tamar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This applies even 100 times (a widow does Yibum, and the Yavam dies, his other wives are exempt from Yibum with Shimon).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah said that if she died, the Tzaros are permitted. What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shimon's daughter (or another Ervah) Esther was married to Reuven, who had another wife Miryam. If Shimon's daughter died or was divorced, and then Reuven died, Reuven's other wife may do Yibum with Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If Shimon's daughter could have done Mi'un but didn't, the Tzarah may do Chalitzah (with Shimon) but not Yibum (with him).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ORDER OF THE <i>MISHNAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> (Later in our Sugya) we learn all Arayos in the Mishnah from Achos Ishto (his wife's sister). That case should have been taught first!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Mishnah lists the most severe cases first.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We would have to say that the Tana holds like R. Shimon, who says that Sereifah (death by burning) is harsher than stoning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> If so, the Tana should have taught Chamoso (his mother-in-law) first, for the Torah writes Sereifah regarding Chamoso, and from it we learn Sereifah for other Arayos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> If so, his daughter-in-law should follow Chamoso, since (R. Shimon holds that) stoning is the harshest punishment next to burning!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Bito (his daughter) was taught first, because it is not explicit in the Torah. The Tana needed to expound it, therefore he prefers it.</p>
