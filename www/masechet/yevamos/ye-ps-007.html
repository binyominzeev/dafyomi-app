<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>IS EXECUTION PERMITTED ON SHABBOS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Simi bar Ashi):</span> The Tana did not think that execution overrides Shabbos because an Aseh overrides a Lav. Rather, a Kal va'Chomer suggested this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Avodah (in the Mikdash) is severe, it overrides Shabbos. Execution overrides Avodah - "From My Mizbe'ach you will take him to die".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Avodah overrides Shabbos, all the more so execution does!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Tana say (Suggestion #2) 'Perhaps it does not override'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Burial of a Mes Mitzvah (a Mes with no one else to bury it) disproves the Kal va'Chomer. It overrides Avodah, but it is not Docheh Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Tana reconsidered and suggested (Suggestion #3) that burial of a Mes Mitzvah should override Shabbos from a Kal va'Chomer:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Avodah overrides Shabbos, and we learn from "Ul'Achoso" that burial of a Mes Mitzvah overrides Avodah (someone heading to offer Korban Pesach may not interrupt to bury his sister, but he interrupts to bury a Mes Mitzvah, even though he will not be able to offer Pesach afterwards)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Therefore, "Do not burn..." is needed to teach that execution is not Docheh Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> First, the Tana thought that execution overrides Shabbos just like an Aseh overrides a Lav. Why did he think that execution might not override Shabbos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We find that an Aseh overrides a simple Lav, but not one that has Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He later thought that an Aseh overrides a Lav even though a Lav is more severe. If so, even if it is much more severe (i.e. Kares)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Therefore, we need "Do not kindle..." to forbid execution on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to question 5:b Daf 3b):</span> If not for "Aleha", one might have thought that the Isur of Eshes Ach was part of a Klal (the category of Arayos), and the special law taught about it (it is permitted for Yibum) applies to the entire Klal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> An example of something that was part of a Klal, and a special law was taught about it is "A Tamei person who will eat Shelamim"</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Shelamim is in the Klal of Kodshim. The Torah specified (Kares for a Tamei person who eats) Shelamim to equate all Kodshim to it. It is Kodshei Mizbe'ach, so too (Kares for eating b'Tum'ah is only for) all Kodshei Mizbe'ach, but not Bedek ha'Bayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Here, also, Eshes Ach is in the Klal of Arayos. It was singled out to be permitted (for Yibum. If not for Aleha,) one would think that all Arayos are permitted (for Yibum).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The comparison is improper! In the Beraisa, the Klal and Perat (specific case) are both forbidden. Here, the Klal is forbidden, and the Perat is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, our case is a law that was part of a Klal, and was given a new law. It does not retain the other laws of the Klal unless the Torah specifically says so:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a law was part of a Klal, and was given a new law, it does not retain the other laws of the Klal unless the Torah specifically says so.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "He will slaughter (Asham) where Chatas and Olah are slaughtered... <i>Asham is like Chatas</i>" - why is this needed? (It already says that they are slaughtered in the same place!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the Asham of a Metzora has a new law, some of its blood is put on the right thumb and toe (and ear of the Metzora), one might have thought that its blood and Chelev need not be put on the Mizbe'ach;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Therefore, "Asham is like Chatas" obligates putting the blood and Emurim of Asham on the Mizbe'ach, like Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>If not for this verse, one would say that the laws of other Korbanos do not apply to Asham, only what the Torah specified regarding Asham.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Also in our case, Eshes Ach was permitted, not other relatives (so "Aleha" is not needed)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to question 5:b, 3b):</span> Rather, we would have thought to learn from a Mah Matzinu (precedent) from Eshes Ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like Eshes Ach does Yibum, also Achos Ishto (his sister's wife).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> These are different. Regarding Eshes Ach, there is only one Isur. Regarding Achos Ishto, there are two!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that once there is permission, even more Isurim are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ONE LENIENCY CAUSES ANOTHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to allow additional things?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Normally, a Tevul Yom (one who was Tovel today, he is still slightly Tamei until nightfall) may not enter Har ha'Bayis. However, if Erev Pesach was the eighth day (of Taharah) of a Metzora, and he saw an emission that day and immersed, he may enter (to have Dam ha'Asham put on him to complete his Taharah so he can offer Korban Pesach). It is better that an Aseh (Korban Peach) punishable by Kares override an Aseh without Kares (Temei'im must leave the Mikdash).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> There is not even an Aseh of the Torah (for a Tevul Yom to leave)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Yehoshafat stood up... in front of <i>the new courtyard</i>."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It is called this because they made new laws. They said that a Tevul Yom may not enter Machaneh Levi until nightfall.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ula):</span> (A Metzora must enter his ear, thumb and toe into the Azarah to receive the blood. Mid'Oraisa, a Tevul Yom may not enter the Azarah.) Why is this permitted for this Tevul Yom?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> Since the Torah allows him to partially enter even though some Tum'ah remains from his Tzara'as, it is permitted even if some Tum'ah also remains from his emission.</p></div>
