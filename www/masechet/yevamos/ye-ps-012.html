<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>YIBUM</i> AFTER THE DEATH OF A <i>MACHAZIR</i> <i>GERUSHASO</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The attempted answers 3:d and 3:e (Daf 11B) are proposed and rejected exactly as above.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A MEMA'ENES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Lili bar Mamal):</span> If Leah was married mid'Rabanan to Shimon, and she was Mema'enes (retroactively annulled the marriage), her Tzarah is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To whom is she forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot be to the brothers. Leah herself is permitted, all the more so her Tzarah is!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If she did Mi'un to one brother, she is permitted to a different brother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Her Tzarah is forbidden to Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Leah is permitted to the brothers, since they did not do an action with her. Shimon should also be permitted to the Tzarah, since he did no act with her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a decree to forbid her, lest one permit the Tzarah of Bito Mema'enes (the Yavam's daughter, who happened to do Mi'un).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tzarah of Bito Mema'enes is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In every case, if the Arayos died or did Mi'un, the Tzaros are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To whom did she do Mi'un?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If she did Mi'un to her husband, this is the just like being divorced!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She did Mi'un to the Yavam.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, she did Mi'un to the husband. The Mishnah teaches about two kinds of divorce.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different? When she does Mi'un to the husband, she uproots the marriage. Also when she does Mi'un to the Yavam, she uproots the original marriage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tzarah is forbidden for the reason of Rami bar Yechezkel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Yechezkel):</span> If she did Mi'un to the husband, she is permitted to the father. If she did Mi'un to the brother, she is forbidden to the father;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Because when she fell to Yibum she looked like his daughter-in-law, therefore she is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Here too, when she fell to Yibum, she looked like the Tzarah of his daughter!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TZARAS AILONIS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> Tzaras Ailonis is forbidden. "Asher Teled" excludes an Ailonis, since she is sterile.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes - Mishnah):</span> Three brothers were married to three unrelated women. Reuven died; Shimon gave Ma'amar (Kidushei Yevamah mid'Rabanan) to Reuven's widow and then he died. Shimon's widows do Chalitzah but not Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"And one of them died" - Yibum applies when she is widowed from one brother, not from two.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> This is the case of Tzaras Eshes Ach which is forbidden because of the fall to Yibum. We do not find a case in the Torah like this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav Yosef comes to exclude Tzaras Ailonis, who is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he comes to exclude Tzaras Ailonis, who is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did he say "this is the case"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In this case, the Tzarah needs Chalitzah. Tzaras Ailonis does not need Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Isur to do Yibum in the Mishnah is only mid'Rabanan. An Ailonis is forbidden mid'Oraisa to do Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> In any of these cases, if she died... or was found to be an Ailonis, the Tzaros are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the Mishnah, the husband did not know that she was an Ailonis (so they were never truly married); Rav Asi discusses when he knew that she was an Ailonis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> The Mishnah says that she was found to be an Ailonis. It does not say she was (already known to be) an Ailonis.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">12b----------------------------------------12b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah is that Tzaras Ailonis is permitted, even if her husband knew that she was an Ailonis, and even if the Ailonis is the Yavam's daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says if she was found (to be an Ailonis)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It should say "if she <i>was</i>".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> The Tzarah of a Mema'enes, of an Ailonis, or of Machazir Gerushaso is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CAN A MINOR GIVE BIRTH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Bivi - Beraisa):</span> Three women use a wad to prevent pregnancy: a minor, a pregnant woman, and a nursing woman. (Rashi - they <i>may</i> use a contraceptive wad at the time of Bi'ah. Tosfos - this is forbidden! Rather, they <i>must</i> use a wad <i>after</i> Bi'ah to remove the semen.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A minor does so, lest she get pregnant, and this might kill her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A pregnant woman does so lest the fetus get mashed (Rashi - if a second fetus is conceived; Tosfos - this is impossible. Rather, we are concerned lest there are already two fetuses inside, and semen will enter between them);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A nursing woman does so lest pregnancy force her to wean her baby, and it will die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Meir says, a girl between 11 and 12 years uses a wad. If she is younger or older, she has relations normally.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, at any age she has normal relations. Shamayim will have mercy on her - "Hash-m guards the simple."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It says that pregnancy might kill an 11-year-old. This implies that a minor may get pregnant and not die!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it is possible for a mother-in-law to do Mi'un i.e. she gave birth before 12). The Mishnah says that we cannot find this case!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, the Beraisa should say 'lest she get pregnant and (certainly) die.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Livai):</span> Before this age (11), she will not get pregnant at all; during this time (11 to 12), she and the fetus will die; after (12), she and the fetus will live.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rabah bar Shmuel taught a Beraisa that says that one cannot say that the mother-in-law did Mi'un... because she already gave birth! (He did not say 'because she is already an adult.' This implies that a minor can give birth, just she may not do Mi'un afterwards.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, our text 'lest she get pregnant, and this <i>might</i> kill her' is correct.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, how do we answer Question (e)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Safra):</span> (Bearing) a child is like Simanim (two hairs that show adulthood).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Some say that a child is better than Simanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is it <i>better</i>? (Also after Simanim she cannot do Mi'un!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even R. Yehudah, who permits Mi'un (after Simanim) until she has many hairs, agrees that she may not do Mi'un if she has given birth.</p>
