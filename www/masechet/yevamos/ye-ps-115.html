<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IS A WOMAN BELIEVED IN WARTIME?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If she informed us that there is war in the world, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is she believed due to a Migo? I.e. it is unreasonable that she would say such a lie. (If she wanted to lie,) she could have said that there is peace in the world (and surely she would be believed)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since it is now established that it is wartime, are we concerned that she testifies by estimation, and the Migo does not override this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If a woman says 'the house burned and was full of smoke. I survived, and he died', she is not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There is different. She reasons that a miracle was done for her, but not for him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If a woman says 'Nochrim or robbers came upon us. He was killed, and I survived', she is believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That case is different, like Rav Idi taught.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Idi):</span> A woman's weapons are with her (she does not fear robbers, for they would rather have relations with her than kill her (Rashi) or because they have mercy on her (Tosfos). Therefore, she waits to see if her husband really died.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>At the end of a Chupah, a fire broke out. The Kalah cried 'See, it is my husband!' They found a burned man and a hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya bar Avin:</span> This is like the case of the house that burned (she is not believed).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Here is different! She cried, 'See, it is my husband'! And here, a burned man and a hand were found!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Chiya bar Avin is concerned lest the burned man tried to save her husband, and the hand is her husband's. He became blemished, and fled due to shame.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE WITNESS IN WAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is one witness believed in wartime?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one witness is believed because people do not lie about matters that are Avid l'Igluyei (prone to become known, e.g. if the husband is alive), here also, he will not lie!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one witness is believed because she will investigate before marrying, here, perhaps she hates him (Maharshal's text - she will rely on estimation) and will not investigate!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rami bar Chama - Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> In Eretz Yisrael, only R. Yehudah ben Bava permitted a woman to remarry based on one witness. Nechemyah of Beis Deli said, 'You know, the land is perilous because of troops. I received from R. Gamliel that we may marry a woman based on one witness.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he say, the land is perilous because of troops?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Even though soldiers are rampant, we may marry a woman based on one witness.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> If so, what is special about this land? He should have said 'Any place where soldiers are rampant'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 to Question (1) - Rava):</span> Rather, this land is perilous because of the troops, and I cannot leave my household to testify in front of Chachamim. I received from R. Gamliel that a woman may marry based on one witness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> A case occurred in which two Chachamim were coming in a ship with R. Yosi ben Simai. The ship sank; Rebbi allowed their widows to remarry based on the testimony of women.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Drowning is like war; and even 100 women are like one witness, and Rebbi allowed the widows to remarry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This cannot be! Whenever one cannot see the end of the water, she is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rather, women saw the bodies immediately (after they were taken from the water), and they gave identifying signs;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">115b----------------------------------------115b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi relied on the Simanim, not on the women.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Reuven deposited sesame with Shimon, and later asked for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> You already took it back!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> The quantity is such and such, and it is in a barrel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> You took yours. I have other sesame.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> This is like the case of the two Chachamim. We do not say that they went elsewhere, and other men were found (with the same Simanim. Also here, we are not concerned lest Reuven took his sesame, and Shimon has different sesame.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This case is different! There, there were Simanim. Here, there are not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though Reuven gave the correct quantity, perhaps he guessed right!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Kashisha bar Rav Chisda):</span> We are not concerned lest something was removed and replaced!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the letter Kuf is on a vessel (denoting Korban), we assume that the contents are Hekdesh. If there is a Mem, Dalet, Tes or Tav, the contents are Ma'aser, Dimua (Terumah mixed with Chulin), Tevel (untithed produce) or Terumah, respectively.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When there were decrees against Mitzvos, people wrote Tav in place of Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Ravina):</span> You cannot say that no one is concerned lest something was removed and replaced!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa - R. Yosi):</span> Even if Terumah is written on the barrel, it is Chulin. We assume that the Terumah inside was removed and replaced by Chulin (the majority usage).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions (Ravina):</span> Really, both Tana'im are concerned lest the contents were removed and replaced;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana holds that had he transferred the Terumah, he would have erased the marking on the barrel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi assumes that he forgot to do so, or he left the Tav to discourage others from taking the contents.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ARE WE CONCERNED FOR OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE SAME NAME?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Yitzchak Reish Galusa, the nephew of Rav Bivi, was going from Korteva to Aspamya; he died. They relayed this information back to Korteva. (Rashba - he was the head of Yisrael in Galus. Tosfos Rid - his name was Yitzchak Reish Galusa.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are we concerned lest a different man with this name died (and forbid R. Yitzchak's widow to remarry, even though we do not know of another man with this name)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> We are concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> We are not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Abaye, for himself):</span> A Get was found in Nehardai. It said 'next to Kalonya (a city), I, Androlinai of Nehardai, divorce my wife.' Shmuel's father sent this question to R. Yehudah Nesi'ah, who answered that all of Nehardai must be checked (for another Androlinai).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> This is no proof. If we were truly concerned, we would have to check the whole world!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah Nesi'ah said to check only so that Shmuel's father would not be embarrassed for asking the question.</p>
