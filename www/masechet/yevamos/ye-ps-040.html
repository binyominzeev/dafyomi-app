<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE MITZVAH TO EAT SHIYAREI MENACHOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Reisha):</span> "(The remainder of a Minchah after Kemitzah) Matzos Te'achel b'Makom Kadosh" is a Mitzvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Initially (before it was made Hekdesh), it was permitted. It became forbidden (when it was made Hekdesh), and was permitted again (after the Kometz was offered).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it returns to its initial Heter!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Matzos Te'achel b'Makom Kadosh" - this is a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We understand according to Rava, who says that the Beraisa is Chachamim. "Matzos Te'achel b'Makom Kadosh" is a Mitzvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Initially, it was permitted - he may eat it or not. It became forbidden, then again permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it returns to its initial Heter!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, this cannot be! "v'Achlu Osam Asher Kupar ba'Hem" teaches that Kohanim (must) eat to enable a full Kaparah for the owner of the Korban!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, perhaps if he (the Kohen who offered it) wants, he eats. If not, another Kohen will eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Matzos Te'achel b'Makom Kadosh" - it is a Mitzvah (for him to eat).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yitzchak bar Avdimi established the Beraisa like Aba Sha'ul. What two types of eating are there?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You cannot say that he may eat with appetite, or Achilah Gasah (gorging oneself to the point of nausea). The latter is not considered eating!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If one ate Achilah Gasah on Yom Kipur he is not liable for "Lo Se'uneh" (not fasting).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, he may eat it as Matzah or as Chametz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It says, "Lo Se'afeh Chelkam Chametz"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Even the Kohanim's portion may not be baked as Chametz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, they may eat it as Matzos or scalded.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the status of scalding?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is Matzah, surely it may be eaten this way!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is not Matzah, he does not fulfill "Matzos Te'achel..."!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, it is Matzah. The Torah requires eating proper Matzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding what is scalding like Matzah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A person is Yotzei Matzah with it on Pesach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though he first scalded it, since he later baked it in an oven if is called "Lechem Oni".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHO INHERITS THE DECEASED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one did Chalitzah to his Yevamah, he is like a regular brother regarding inheritance. If the father is alive, he inherits the deceased;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he did Yibum, he inherits the deceased;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, in any case, if the father is alive the father inherits the property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> This is obvious (that he is like a regular brother)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> One might have thought that Chalitzah is in place of Yibum, and he should inherit the deceased;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, why does it say that 'He is like one of the brothers'? It should say 'he is <i>only</i> like one of the brothers!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, one might have thought that since he prevented her from doing Yibum, she should be punished. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the father is alive...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A father inherits before any of his descendants.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who does Yibum (inherits the deceased).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because he fulfilled "Yakum Al Shem Achiv".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> R. Yehudah learns from "And the firstborn that she will bear" - just like a firstborn does not receive in the father's lifetime, also one who does Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should say that just like a Bechor receives a double portion when the father dies, also one who does Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It does not say 'Yakum Al Shem <i>Aviv</i> (his father)', rather, "Al Shem Achiv".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that there is a Mitzvah of Yibum only when there is no father, and the Yavam inherits the deceased!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yibum does not depend on inheritance. He does Yibum, and if he inherits, he inherits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina Kara):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">R. Yanai:</span> Do not teach thusly in the Beis Medrash! The Halachah does not follow R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(A reciter of teachings):</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Does the Halachah follow Chachamim? That is obvious, we rule like the majority!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">The reciter:</span> If so, I will discard this teaching.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Do not discard it. You were taught that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah. It was difficult to you (why we follow an individual), so you switched it. You were correct to do so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>ISURIM</i> THAT RESULT FROM <i>CHALITZAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Shimon died and Reuven did Chalitzah to Leah, he is forbidden to her relatives, and she is forbidden to his;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">40b----------------------------------------40b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He may not marry her mother, grandmothers, daughter, granddaughters, and not her sister in her lifetime;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The brothers are permitted to her relatives. She is forbidden to Reuven's father, his father's father, his son, his son's son, his brother, and his brother's son;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A man is permitted to the relative of the Tzarah of his Chalutzah, but forbidden to the Tzarah of the relative of his Chalutzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Did Chachamim decree Sheniyos regarding a Chalutzah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Did they forbid Sheniyos only of Ervah mid'Oraisa, but not regarding a Chalutzah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, did they not distinguish (and decreed even regarding a Chalutzah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> Reuven is forbidden to Leah's mother, grandmothers...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It does not list her mother's mother's mother (because we did not decree)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps the great grandmother is really forbidden. The Tana omitted it because the Seifa teaches that the brothers are permitted to Leah's relatives. Had the Reisha included the great grandmother, one might have thought that the Seifa permits the brothers only to her, but not to Leah's mother and grandmothers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It could have included the Isur of the great grandmother, and said that the brothers are permitted to all of them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> Leah is forbidden to Reuven's father, his father's father...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> She is forbidden to them due to Reuven. Because of the Chalitzah, she is considered the daughter-in-law of the son of Reuven's grandfather. (This shows that we decreed Sheniyos regarding a Chalutzah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it is due to Shimon (her deceased husband. She is truly Kalas Beno of Shimon's grandfather).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Mishnah):</span> Leah is forbidden to his (Reuven's) son's son (Kalev).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is due to Reuven. She is the wife of Kalev's grandfather!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it is due to Shimon. She is truly the wife of the brother of Kalev's grandfather.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ameimar permits the wife of the brother of one's grandfather!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ameimar will explain that <i>his</i> son's son in the Mishnah refers to (Leah's nephew,) <i>Reuven's father's</i> son's son (Reuven's father was mentioned just before this).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does the Mishnah explicitly forbid Reuven's brother and brother's son? (This is 'his son and his son's son'!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'Reuven's brother and his brother's son' forbids maternal brothers and nephews.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya - Beraisa):</span> Four are forbidden mid'Oraisa [to a Chalutzah], and four mid'Rabanan. His (the Choletz') father, son, brother and brother's son are mid'Oraisa. His father's father, mother's father, the son of his son, and the son of his daughter are mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The father of his father is due to the Choletz, she is like his son's daughter-in-law (a Sheniyah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it is due to the deceased (she truly is his son's daughter-in-law).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The father of his mother is due to the Choletz, she is like his daughter's daughter-in-law (a Sheniyah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it is due to the deceased.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The son of his son is due to the Choletz, she is like his father's father's wife (a Sheniyah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it is due to the deceased, she is like the wife of the brother of his father's father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ameimar permits the wife of the brother of one's father's father!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ameimar must say that it is due to the Choletz, i.e. we decreed Sheniyos regarding a Chalutzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The son of his daughter is due to the Choletz, she is like the wife of his mother's father (a Sheniyah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, due to the deceased, she is the wife of the brother of his mother's father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(v)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The wife of the brother of one's mother's father is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(w)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Rather, we must say that it is due to the Choletz. We did decree Sheniyos regarding a Chalutzah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ISURIM AFTER CHALITZAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Tuvi bar Kisna):</span> If one had Bi'ah with the Tzarah of his Chalutzah, the child is a Mamzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because she retains the Isur of Eshes Ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Yosef - Mishnah):</span> A man is permitted to the relative of Tzaras Chalutzaso.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Tzarah is 'outside' (keeps her original Isur, for the Chalutzah was not like her Shali'ach), we understand why he may marry her sister.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, if the Tzarah is like the Chalutzah, he should be forbidden to her sister (just like one is forbidden to Achos Chalutzaso)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refutes R. Yochanan!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Neither the Choletz nor his brothers are Chayav Kares for Bi'ah with the Chalutzah or the Tzaros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Achos Chalutzaso is not forbidden mid'Oraisa. (Therefore, even if the Tzarah is like the Chalutzah, we need not say that the Choletz is forbidden to her sister.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Rebbi taught (in the coming Mishnah) that the sister of one's divorcee is forbidden mid'Oraisa, but Achos Chalutzaso is forbidden mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the relative of Tzaras Chalutzaso permitted, but the Tzarah of the relative of one's Chalutzah is forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Often, a Yevamah's relative (Rachel) accompanies her to Beis Din (for Chalitzah), so Chachamim decreed that Rachel's Tzarah not marry a brother (lest people think that Rachel did Chalitzah, and if Rachel's Tzarah marries a brother, it looks like Yibum after Chalitzah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Yevamah's Tzarah does not accompany her to Beis Din, so there is no need to decree.</p>
