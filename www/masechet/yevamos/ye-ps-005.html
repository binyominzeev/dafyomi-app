<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE SOURCE THAT AN <i>ASEH</i> OVERRIDES A <i>LAV</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael learns from Tzitzis that Aseh Docheh Lo Sa'aseh. What is Chachamim's source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They learn from Taharas Metzora. He must shave (all his hair, including) his head (and transgress cutting the Pe'os):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Rosho" - if not for this verse, one would think that "Al Takifu Pe'as Roshchem" applies even to Taharas Metzora.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Tana holds that one who cuts all the hair on his head transgresses cutting the Pe'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Lav not to cut the Pe'os applies only to men. We cannot learn from here that an Aseh overrides a Lav that is Shavah b'Chol (applies to everyone)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We learn from the Taharah of a Kohen Metzora. (Even though there is a special Mitzvah for Kohanim not to shave,) he shaves his beard.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If not for "Zekano", one would have thought that "They (Kohanim) will not shave the corners of their beards" applies even to a Kohen Metzora. (Also Yisre'elim are commanded. The rejection of this answer is based on the Isur for Kohanim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since we already learned that an Aseh overrides a Lav that is not Shavah b'Chol, this must teach that even a Lav ha'Shavah b'Chol may be overridden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We need the verse to permit a Kohen Metzora to shave!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that since the Torah gave extra Mitzvos to Kohanim, their extra Mitzvos are not overridden, even though they are not Shavah b'Chol!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> We learn from "Rosho" like the following Tana:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "A razor will not pass over Rosho" applies to a Nazir even if he is a Metzora!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Rosho" teaches that the Mitzvah for a Metzora to shave overrides the Lav for a Nazir to shave (his head).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Since we already learned that an Aseh overrides a Lav that is not Shavah b'Chol, this must teach that even a Lav ha'Shavah b'Chol may be overridden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Isurim of a Nazir are weaker, since one can annul the Nezirus. We cannot learn to a regular Lav!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (for objection) Question:</span> We hold that an Aseh does not override a Lav and an Aseh. Why don't we learn from Nazir that it does? (He also has an Aseh to grow his hair, "Kadosh Yihyeh Gadel Pera".)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn from Isurei Nazir, since they can be annulled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>For the same reason we cannot learn from Nazir that an Aseh overrides a Lav.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> Really, we learn from the Semichus of the Mitzvah of Tzitzis to the Isur of Sha'atnez.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "Gedilim" instead of 'Tzitzis' to teach that we should expound the Semichus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It needs to say "Gedilim" to teach the number of threads!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Gedil' is (strings wrapped together, i.e. at least) two. "Gedilim" (plural) is four;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> (These are inserted through the corner, making eight ends;) we make a Gedil (wrap them together). "Pesil" teaches that we leave part like Pesilim (unwrapped).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> "Pesil" teaches that we (insert them through the corner and) fold them. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It would have sufficed to say "Sha'atnez Tzemer u'Pishtim". The Torah added "Yachdav " (together) to be free (to expound the Semichus).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We need this ("Yachdav") to teach that two stitches are considered connected, but one stitch is not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Torah could have said just "Tzemer u'Pishtim Yachdav ". "Sha'atnez" was added to be free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We need the word "Sha'atnez" to teach that it must be Shu'A, Tavuy, and NuZ (smoothed, spun and woven)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn everything from the word "Sha'atnez" (the Torah could have said 'Kil'ayim', and it could have explicitly said Shu'a, Tavuy, and Nuz).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IS AN <i>AVEIRAH</i> WITH <i>KARES</i> OVERRIDDEN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This shows that a regular Lav may be overridden. We still have not answered Question 5:d (Daf 3b), where do we find that a Lav with Kares is overridden (necessitating "Aleha" to teach that Yibum does not override Eshes Ach? Circumcision, Korban Pesach and the Tamid override Shabbos, but we cannot learn from them!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We cannot learn from Milah, for 13 covenants were made over it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We cannot learn from Korban Pesach, for one who neglects to offer it gets Kares!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We cannot learn from the Tamid, since this is a constant Mitzvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We cannot learn from any one of these. Perhaps we can learn from a Tzad ha'Shavah of two of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from circumcision and Pesach, for both of these have Kares (but a regular Aseh does not override Kares);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We cannot learn from Pesach and Tamid, for these are needs of (Avodas Mizbe'ach of) Hash-m!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We cannot learn from circumcision and Tamid, for both of these preceded Matan Torah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is like the opinion that the Olos offered in the Midbar were Temidim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>We cannot learn from all three, since they all preceded Matan Torah!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>COULD WE LEARN FROM HONORING PARENTS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to Question #1, Sof Daf 3b):</span> Had the Torah not written "Aleha" we would gave learned from Kibud Av va'Em that even a Mitzvah with Kares is overridden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Kibud Av va'Em overrides Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "A man will fear his parents, and keep My Shabbosos" - all of you (even your parents) must honor Hash-m!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The parent told the child to slaughter or cook. If not for the verse, this would override a Melachah of Shabbos (which is Chayavei Kerisos)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, he told the child to be Mechamer (make an animal work). This is a Lav (without Kares), yet it does not override Shabbos.</p>
