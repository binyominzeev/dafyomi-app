<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>ISURIM</i> AFTER <i>CHALITZAH</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven did Chalitzah with Leah and then his brother married her sister, then died, Reuven does Chalitzah, but not Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Similarly, if Reuven divorced his wife and then his brother married her sister, then died, the widow is exempt (from Chalitzah and Yibum);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah ben Beseira says, if Reuven was Mekadesh the sister of his Yevamah we tell him to wait until his brother (Shimon) does Yibum or Chalitzah. After that, he may make Nisu'in;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If the Yevamah died, he may make Nisu'in. If Shimon died, Reuven divorces his wife and does Chalitzah to the Yevamah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does it say 'similarly'? (The Halachah is different!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> It means '<i>however</i>, if he divorced...'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> In this Mishnah, Rebbi taught that the Isur of the sister of one's divorcee is mid'Oraisa. The sister of one's Chalutzah is only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was Mekadesh the sister of his Yevamah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah ben Beseira.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Reuven's wife died, may he do Yibum?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> No.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rav holds that if a Yevamah was permitted, then forbidden, and the Isur lapsed, she becomes permitted again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Hamnuna - Beraisa):</span> Reuven and Shimon were married to Rachel and Leah (sisters); Levi (another brother) was single. Reuven died, Levi gave a Ma'amar to Rachel, and then Shimon died, and then Leah died. Rachel does Chalitzah, but not Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why don't we say that she was permitted, forbidden, and permitted again when the Isur (Achos Zekukaso) lapses?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Rava was silent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava, after Rav Hamnuna left):</span> That Beraisa is like R. Elazar, who holds that once a Yevamah was forbidden, she remains forbidden forever.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Rava):</span> That is not a proper answer. R. Elazar said so only when she was forbidden when she fell to Yibum. Here, she was permitted when she fell, we have no source that R. Elazar would forbid her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Defense (Rava):</span> Indeed, it is a proper answer. We have a source!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> If (a man was Mekadesh his Yevamah's sister, and) his Yevamah died, he is permitted to his wife. If his wife died, he does Chalitzah, but not Yibum, to the Yevamah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Shmuel (who said above that she is forbidden) must hold like R. Elazar!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, he can hold like Chachamim (109a, who say that if a man divorced his wife, remarried her, and then died, she may do Yibum);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim permit because she was not prohibited after she fell to Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In our Mishnah she became forbidden after she fell, so Chachamim agree that she is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WAITING BETWEEN MARRIAGES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Yevamah may not do Yibum or Chalitzah within three months of the death of her husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Similarly, no woman may become Mekudeshes or married for three months, whether or not she is a virgin, whether she was divorced or widowed, from Nisu'in or Kidushin;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, if she was only Mekudeshes she may get married. If she was married, she may become Mekudeshes. This does not apply to Arusos in Yehudah, since they are intimate with their husbands;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yosi says, all women may become become Mekudashos, but a widow must wait until the Aveilus (mourning) over her husband ends.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">41b----------------------------------------41b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Granted, she may not do Yibum within three months, lest she is pregnant with a viable child, and they transgress Eshes Ach mid'Oraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, why is Chalitzah forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah refutes R. Yochanan, who says that Chalitzah of a pregnant woman is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He was already refuted!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We suggest that also our Mishnah refutes him! (This is worse, for perhaps he did not know the Beraisa that refuted him, but surely he knew the Mishnah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Our Mishnah is no refutation. Chalitzah is forbidden lest she give birth to a viable child, and we will need a proclamation that she is permitted to a Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is wrong with that?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If someone saw the Chalitzah and did not hear the proclamation, he will think that she is forbidden to a Kohen (and perhaps she will marry a Kohen)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This applies to a regular widow. If she was previously divorced (she is forbidden to a Kohen in any case), she should do Chalitzah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chalitzah deprives her of being fed (from her husband's estate).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This applies to one who fell to Yibum from Nisu'in. If she fell from Kidushin (she is not fed), how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the reason is like R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A man asked R. Yosi if he may do Chalitzah within three months. R. Yosi said that he may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The man:</span> Why don't we do Chalitzah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> "If he does not want to do Yibum" implies that he could do Yibum if he wanted. Only one who could do Yibum can do Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chinena - Beraisa):</span> All doubtful cases do Chalitzah, not Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are the doubtful cases?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We do not know whether or not the Kidushin to the deceased was valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They can do Yibum in any case! (If she was not Mekudeshes, this is regular Nisu'in.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, a man was Mekadesh one of two sisters, and he does not know which one. The Beraisa says that they do Chalitzah (even though Yibum is forbidden)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is no difficulty! There, if Eliyahu would tell us which he was Mekadesh, she could do Yibum or Chalitzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, even if Eliyahu would tell us that she is not pregnant, we would not heed him and do Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A minor cannot be pregnant, yet even she may not do Yibum within three months!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IS A <i>YEVAMAH</i> FED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Yevamah is fed from the estate of the deceased for three months. After this, she is not fed from his property, nor from the Yavam's property;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Yavam went to Beis Din (and was told to do Yibum or Chalitzah) and fled, she is fed from his property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a woman falls to a Yavam who is a minor, she is not fed from his property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is she fed from the property of the deceased?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav Acha and Ravina disagreed about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The Halachah is, she is not fed. Shamayim punished her.</p>
