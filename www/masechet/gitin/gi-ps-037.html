<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PRUZBUL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does the word Pruzbul mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> Prus (an enactment for) Buli and Buti (rich and poor).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Buli are the rich, like Rav Yosef taught.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> "I will break your strength" refers to the Buli of Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Buti are the poor - "Ha'avet Ta'aViTenu (you will lend to him)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> A non-Hebrew speaker told Rabah that 'Pruzbul' denotes an enactment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Orphans do not need a Pruzbul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> This is because R. Gamliel and his Beis Din are like the father of orphans (they enacted as if orphans automatically have a Pruzbul).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Pruzbul may be written on a loan only if the borrower has land;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he has no land, the lender gives him a tiny piece of his land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How small can it be?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Ashi):</span> It must be the size of a cabbage stalk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Even if the borrower borrowed place to put a stove (in a Chatzer (courtyard), Pruzbul may be written on this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (An Amora named) Hillel taught a Beraisa saying that we write Pruzbul on a flowerpot only if it has holes (for then it is considered attached to the ground).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> One may not write Pruzbul on a flowerpot without a hole!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even though he has a place to put it, this is not enough. (Why is an oven different?!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the flowerpot is on pegs. (He has no rights to the place it rests over.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rav Ashi gave to a borrower a stump of a palm tree, and wrote a Pruzbul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>The Rabanan of Rav Ashi's Beis Medrash recited the text of Pruzbul in front of each other (without writing it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>R. Yonason recited it in front of R. Chiya bar Aba.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> This is sufficient.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the borrower has no land but the Arev (guarantor) has land, Pruzbul may be written;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>If neither the borrower nor the Arev has land, but someone who owes money to the borrower has land, Pruzbul may be written, due to R. Nasan's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nasan):</span> "He will give to the one to whom is Asham (the principal)" - if Reuven owes Shimon and Shimon owes Levi, we take money from Reuven to pay Levi.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHICH LOANS ARE CANCELLED IN <i>SHEMITAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Shemitah cancels a loan, whether or not a document was written on the loan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav and Shmuel):</span> 'A document was written on the loan' refers to a document with Acharayus (it gives rights to collect from property sold after the loan was given);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'A document was not written on the loan' is when there is a document without Acharayus, and all the more so (Shemitah cancels) a Milveh Al Peh (a loan without any document).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish):</span> 'A document was written on the loan' refers to a document without Acharayus. 'A document was not written on the loan' refers to a Milveh Al Peh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there is a document with Acharayus, the loan is not cancelled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa #1):</span> Shemitah cancels a loan document. If it has Acharayus, it is not cancelled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> If the borrower designated a field that will be used to pay the loan, the loan is not cancelled in Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if the borrower wrote 'all my property is like an Arev, and may be used to pay the loan', the loan is not cancelled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Asi's relative had a document in which Acharayus was written.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Asi:</span> The loan is not cancelled is Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The lender went to R. Yochanan, who said that the loan is cancelled in Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">The lender:</span> You taught that it is not cancelled!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Should we act upon my reasoning and comparisons?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">The lender:</span> A Beraisa supports you!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Perhaps that Beraisa is like Beis Shamai, who consider a document ready to be collected as if was collected already.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one lent money and took a security, or handed over his documents to Beis Din, the loan is not cancelled in Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand that if he handed over his documents to Beis Din, they are holding the debt, so it is not cancelled;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When he lent and took a security, why isn't the loan cancelled?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It is as if he is holding the payment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> According to this, also if the lender lodges in the borrower's Chatzer, we should say that the loan is not cancelled!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> A loan with a security is different, for the lender acquires a security, like R. Yitzchak taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak) Question:</span> "To you (the lender) it will be Tzedakah (to return the security)" - if the lender does not own it, why is returning it called Tzedakah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, this shows that the lender acquires the security.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">37b----------------------------------------37b</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE WHO WANTS TO REPAY A LOAN THAT WAS CANCELLED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven returns a debt to Shimon in Shemitah (i.e. after Shemitah, in a period when Shemitah applies), Shimon must say 'I refrain (from collecting)';</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven says 'even so, I want to repay', Shimon may take the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We learn this from "this is the matter (word) of Shemitah" (one must say that he refrains from collecting).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> Shimon may hang (coerce) Reuven until Reuven says that he wants to repay anyway.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> When Reuven pays, he may not say 'I am paying the loan.' Rather, he says that it is a gift.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Yes! Shimon hangs Reuven until he says this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Aba bar Minyomi owed money to Rabah; he brought it to him in Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> I refrain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Aba took his money and left. Abaye noticed that Rabah was sad; Rabah explained what happened.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye told Aba that he should have said that he wants to pay anyway, and that he should now return the money and say this. Aba did so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> He did not know enough to do so the first time.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>IS ONE BELIEVED TO SAY THAT HE WROTE A <i>PRUZBUL</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One is believed to say that he wrote a Pruzbul, but it was lost.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Once Pruzbul was enacted, a lender can always collect his loan legally. One will not abandon a permitted way to achieve something and do it in a forbidden manner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>When lenders came before Rav, he would ask 'perhaps you had a Pruzbul, and lost it?'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is a case when we open the mouth of a mute (suggest a claim for one who does not know what he should say).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Also, if a creditor presents a loan document without a Pruzbul, he does not collect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about this law:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a creditor presents a loan document, he must have a Pruzbul to collect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, he does not need a Pruzbul.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>A CAPTURED SLAVE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Shimon's slave was captured, and Reuven redeemed him:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he redeemed him l'Shem Eved (in order that he should be a slave), he works like a slave;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he redeemed him l'Shem Ben Chorin (in order that he should be free), he does not work.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, in either case, he works.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven redeemed him before Shimon despaired (of getting back his slave) l'Shem Ben Chorin, surely he works (for Shimon)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We must say that he redeemed him after Shimon despaired.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, when he was redeemed l'Shem Eved, why does he work?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> Really, he redeemed him before Shimon despaired. If he was redeemed l'Shem Eved, he works for Shimon. If he was redeemed l'Shem Ben Chorin, he does not work for Reuven or Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He does not work for Reuven, since Reuven redeemed him l'Shem Ben Chorin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He does not work for Shimon. This is an enactment, lest people refrain from redeeming slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, in either case he works. R. Shimon holds that it is a Mitzvah to redeem slaves, just like it is a Mitzvah to redeem free people (who were captured, so there is no need for an enactment).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Really, he redeemed him after Shimon despaired. If he was redeemed l'Shem Eved, he works for Reuven. If he was redeemed l'Shem Ben Chorin, he does not work for Reuven or Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He does not work for Reuven, since Reuven redeemed him l'Shem Ben Chorin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He does not work for Shimon, because Shimon already despaired.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon says, in either case he works, like Chizkiyah taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> He works in either case. This is an enactment, lest slaves present themselves to captors to escape their masters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel told Chachamim 'just like it is a Mitzvah to redeem free people, it is a Mitzvah to redeem slaves.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, according to Abaye, this is why R. Shimon says that there is no enactment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Rava, R. Shimon's reason is like Chizkiyah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (for Rava):</span> R. Shimon did not know Chachamim's opinion;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He said 'if you discuss before despair, just like...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If you discuss after despair, we make an enactment, like Chizkiyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rava, he was redeemed after despair, and he works for Reuven. Reuven bought him from the captors. Did the captors really own him?!</p>
