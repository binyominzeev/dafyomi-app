<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>RETRACTION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If you will say that he permitted (even) the one s he initially forbade, if he retracted and said only 'to Reuven', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does he permit her to Reuven, and also to Shimon? (For conciseness, he said only the first one .)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he permits her only to Reuven, but not to Shimon?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> If he permits her only to Reuven, if he retracted and said only 'to Shimon' what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does he permit her to Shimon, and also to Reuven? (For conciseness, he said only the last one he mentioned.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he permits her only to Shimon, but not to Reuven?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> If he said 'even to Shimon', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does he mean 'not only to Reuven, rather, even to Shimon?'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does he mean 'not only to all other men (to whom he permitted her the first time), rather, even to Shimon'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>These questions are unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>QUESTIONS AGAINST R. ELIEZER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> After R. Eliezer died, four Tana'im challenged his position.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (R. Tarfon):</span> If Leah was divorced on condition that she not marry Levi, and she married Levi's brother Reuven, if Reuven dies without children, Yibum is uprooted! (If she would do Yibum, this would uproot the marriage to Reuven, and hence the Yibum is also uprooted.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that such a divorce is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (R. Yosi ha'Glili):</span> We never find that what is permitted to some is forbidden to others. What is permitted is permitted to all, and what is forbidden is forbidden to all!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that such a divorce is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #3 (R. Elazar ben Azaryah):</span> "Krisus" is something that is Kores (severs) between them. This divorce is not Krisus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #4 (R. Akiva):</span> If Leah was divorced on condition that she not marry Levi, and she married David, had children from him, and then married Levi after David died or divorced her, this would uproot her marriage to David, and her children from David are Mamzerim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that (the first) divorce is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #5 (R. Akiva):</span> Also, if Reuven divorced Leah except for Pinchas (a Kohen), and then Reuven died, she is a divorcee regarding all other men, but only a widow regarding Pinchas. (Nevertheless she is forbidden to him. We expounded above that even if she was permitted to only one man, or divorced only from her husband, she is forbidden to Kohanim!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Isur of a divorcee to a Kohen is light (only a Lav), still she is forbidden to Pinchas because she is a divorcee regarding other men;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>All the more so, regarding the severe Isur of Eshes Ish (a married woman), she should be considered an Eshes Ish to all men (until Reuven dies) because she is an Eshes Ish regarding Pinchas!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This shows that such a divorce is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> You cannot refute the lion (R. Eliezer) after his death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One can dispel all the questions, except for R. Elazar ben Azaryah's question.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> R. Elazar ben Azaryah asked the best question.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Tarfon):</span> If David divorced Leah without permitting her to Levi, and she married Levi's brother Reuven, if Reuven would die without children, David uprooted a matter (Yibum) from the Torah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> David did not uproot anything!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he stipulated to uproot a matter from the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> He did not stipulate that she must marry Levi's brother!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he caused it to be uprooted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, one (Moshe) should not be able to marry his brother's daughter, lest Moshe die without children, and Yibum will be uprooted (since the Yavam is the widow's father)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This dispels R. Tarfon's question.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did R. Tarfon understand that R. Eliezer discusses 'except' or 'on condition that'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He discusses 'except'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Eliezer says that in such a case, she is permitted to Levi after Reuven dies!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Eliezer agrees that if one divorced his wife and said 'you are permitted to all men except Levi', and then she married another man and was widowed or divorced, she is permitted to Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he understood that R. Eliezer discusses 'on condition that.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE OTHER QUESTIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Glili):</span> We never find that what is permitted to some is forbidden to others. Rather, what is permitted, is permitted to all, and what is forbidden, is forbidden to all!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Terumah is forbidden (only) to non-Kohanim. Kodshim are forbidden to Tamei people!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi ha'Glili refers to Isurim of a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The incestuous relationships only apply to relatives, they are permitted to others!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He refers to Isurim that come through Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> A married woman is permitted to her husband and forbidden to all others!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This dispels R. Yosi ha'Glili's question.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did R. Yosi ha'Glili understand that R. Eliezer discusses 'except' or 'on condition that'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He discusses 'on condition that.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, she is indeed permitted to all (there was no stipulation about Bi'as Zenus with Levi, only marriage)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he understood that R. Eliezer discusses 'except'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> If Leah was divorced on condition that she not marry Levi, and she married David, had children from him, and then married Levi after David died or divorced her, this would uproot her marriage to David, and her children from David would be Mamzerim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The same applies to any Get given on condition. She should not remarry, lest she not fulfill the Tanai, and this will uproot the Get and her second marriage, and the children will be Mamzerim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This dispels R. Akiva's question.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did R. Akiva understand that R. Eliezer discusses 'except' or 'on condition that'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He discusses 'except'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> In such a case, R. Eliezer permits her to Levi after Reuven dies!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Eliezer admits that if one divorced his wife and said 'you are permitted to all men except Levi', and then she married another man and was widowed or divorced, she is permitted to Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he understood that R. Eliezer discusses 'on condition that.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> Also, if Reuven divorced Leah except for Pinchas, and then Reuven died, she is a divorcee regarding all other men, but only a widow regarding Pinchas. (Nevertheless she is forbidden to him. We expounded above that even if she was permitted to only one man, or divorced only from her husband, she is forbidden to Kohanim!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Isur of a divorcee to a Kohen is light, yet she is forbidden to Pinchas because she is a divorcee regarding other men. All the more so, regarding the severe Isur of Eshes Ish, she is an Eshes Ish to all men because she is an Eshes Ish regarding Pinchas!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does this assume that R. Eliezer discusses 'except' or 'on condition that'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He discusses 'on condition that.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, regarding Bi'as Zenus she is indeed divorced with respect to Levi (so there is no Kal va'Chomer)!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">83b----------------------------------------83b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, R. Eliezer discusses 'except'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Akiva contradicts himself! If he holds that R. Eliezer discusses 'except', he should ask only about that! If he holds that R. Eliezer discusses 'on condition that', he should ask about that!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Akiva heard different opinions about in which case R. Eliezer said his law. He asked a question according to each version.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can his second question be dispelled?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Isur of a divorcee to a Kohen is different than other Isurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Eliezer learns from a Kohen's Isur to a divorcee. He must hold that it is no different!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava (who said that one can dispel all questions except for R. Elazar ben Azaryah's) holds like R. Yanai (that R. Eliezer learns from "and she will be (Mekudeshes) to a man").</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehoshua):</span> You cannot refute R. Eliezer after his death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that R. Yehoshua holds like R. Eliezer. R. Yehoshua also asked a question!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even though also he had a question, he exhorted them not to think that R. Eliezer is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehoshua):</span> The Torah equates a woman's situation before her first marriage to her situation before her second marriage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like before her first marriage, she is not tied to anyone, also before her second marriage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Eliezer admits that if a man divorces his wife and says 'you are permitted to all men except Levi', and then she married another man and was widowed or divorced, she is permitted to Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> We never find that one can permit an Isur that someone else made!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do find this! A Yavam can do Chalitzah, permitting the Isur of the dead brother!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, the Isur (for a Yevamah to marry a stranger) is due to the Yavam himself. The Isur due to the dead brother was permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Chacham can permit someone else's vow!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan taught that a Chacham permits only through the regret of the one who vowed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A man can annul his wife's vows!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Pinchas taught that a woman vows only on condition that her husband wants the vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar ben Azaryah):</span> "Krisus" is something that severs between them. If she is like Moshe's wife regarding Levi, this is not Krisus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The other Tana'im did not ask this. What do they learn from "Krisus"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If one said 'this is your Get on condition that you never drink wine', or 'that you will never go to your father's house', the Get is Pasul, since this is not Krisus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Tanai was for 30 days, this is Krisus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Elazar ben Azaryah learns also this. Since it says "Krisus", not 'Kares', two laws may be learned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The other Tana'im hold that the plural form warrants learning another law.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHICH <i>TANAYIM</i> ARE <i>KERISUS</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one said 'this is your Get on condition that you do not drink wine for the rest of my life', this is not Krisus. If he said 'the rest of Ploni's life', this is Krisus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'the rest of Ploni's life', it is Krisus, for Ploni may die, and the Tanai will be over. The same applies to 'the rest of my life'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rava):</span> Rather, 'this is your Get on condition that you do not drink wine for the rest of your life' is not Krisus. 'The rest of my life or Ploni's life' is Krisus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> (If one gave a Get, and said) 'today you are not my wife. Tomorrow you are my wife', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We can ask according to R. Eliezer, and according to Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer said that partial divorce works only when she is permanently divorced to some, and permanently permitted to everyone else;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>(Here, this is not true.) Perhaps this Get is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim said that divorce does not work only when she was never totally severed from her husband, even for a moment;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Here, once she is severed, perhaps she is forever divorced!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Presumably, once she is severed, she is forever severed, according to all.</p>
