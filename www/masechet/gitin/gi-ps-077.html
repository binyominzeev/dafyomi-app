<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FROM WHEN THE <i>TANAI</i> STARTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If one says '(this is your Get) when the sun will leave its case', all agree, this means from when it rises. If he died during the night, it is a posthumous Get, and is Pasul;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said 'on condition that the sun will leave its case', he means that the Get should take effect immediately;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Saying 'on condition' is like saying 'from now.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>They argue about when he says 'if it will go out,'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Those who hold like R. Yosi, who says that the date on a document shows that it takes effect from the date, say that it is as if he said 'it is a Get from today if I die';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Those who argue with R. Yosi say that it is as if he said 'it should be a Get if I die.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he said 'write and give a Get to my wife if I don't come within 12 months'...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (Rav Yemar):</span> R. Yosi (who says that the Get is valid) must hold that one may write a Get on Tanai, even if the Tanai was not fulfilled!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> No. This case is different, for he should have said 'if I don't come within 12 months, write and give...';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He instead said 'write... if I don't...' to show that the Get should be written now.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim do not distinguish between the two ways of saying it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one said '(give a Get if I do not come) after the Shemitah cycle', we wait one year after Shemitah. If he said 'after a year', we wait (another) month; if he said 'after a month', we wait one week;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he said 'after Shabbos' what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> The three days after Shabbos are considered after Shabbos. The three days before the coming Shabbos are considered before Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If he said 'after the festival', we wait 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Chiya taught this law in Rebbi's name, and the listeners approved. He taught it in the name of Chachamim, and the listeners did not show approval.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>He concluded that the Halachah does not follow this teaching.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK HA'ZOREK</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A <i>GET</i> THROWN INTO HER DOMAIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one threw a Get to his wife when she was in her house or Chatzer (courtyard), it is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he threw it in his own house or Chatzer, even if she is in a bed with him, it is Pasul;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he throws it into her garment or basket, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "and he puts in her hand" obligates putting the Get in her hand, but not in her roof or yard!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "And he puts" teaches that he may put in anywhere (that belongs to her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>We learn similarly about a thief.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps a thief is liable only if the stolen item is found "in his hand", but not in his roof or yard!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Found, will be found" obligates him no matter where (in his property) it is found.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The Torah needed to teach both of these:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only about a Get, one might have thought that that is because she is divorced against her will; but theft, which is only when he intends, must be in his hand;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only about theft, one might have thought that the Torah punishes a thief, but a Get must enter her hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah discusses her yard. A man acquires his wife's property. It is like his yard!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> The case is, he wrote to her 'I have no claims to your property,'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This doesn't help!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one said to his partner 'I have no claims on this field', 'I have no involvement with it', or 'my hand is withdrawn from it', his words are void.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yanai):</span> He wrote this to her during Eirusin (before Nisu'in);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>He holds like Rav Kahana, and like Rava:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> One may stipulate that he does not want to inherit an inheritance mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one says 'I do not want the enactment Chachamim made to help me', in a case like this (Rav Huna's law), we heed his words.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">77b----------------------------------------77b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> A woman can tell her husband 'do not feed me, and I will not give to you my earnings.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Even when he puts the Get in her hand, we must explain why it works. Also her hand belongs to him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> We must say, the moment the Get is put in her hand, she is divorced and simultaneously gets back her Yad (power of acquisition).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also regarding her roof or yard, the moment the Get enters them, she is divorced and they are hers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Why does Rava need to explain how a Get works when he puts it in her hand?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, he owns the productivity of her hands, but he does not own her hands!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Rava meant, we must explain the opinion (Kidushin 22b) that a slave can himself receive a Get of freedom from his master.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A slave's hand is like his master's hand (whatever he acquires belongs to the master)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava answered that when a Get of freedom is put in a slave's hand, he simultaneously goes free and acquires his Yad;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This can also explain how a woman can receive a Get in her roof or yard!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ACQUISITION THROUGH ONE'S PROPERTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A Shechiv Mera wrote a Get to his wife shortly before Shabbos. He was unable to give it before Shabbos. He did not expect to survive until after Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> He should give to her, for a gift, the place where the Get is resting. She should close the door there (on Shabbos) to acquire it through Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One acquires through Chazakah by locking up, fencing, or breaching a fence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ilish:</span> How will it help her to acquire the area? What a wife acquires belongs to her husband!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rava was embarrassed. Later, it was found that she was only an Arusah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A husband gets only what his wife acquires after Nisu'in, not during Eirusin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Rava):</span> Even if she was Nesu'ah, my suggestion works. She acquires the area at the moment of divorce!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava already said this above!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The above statement was Rava's conclusion about this case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she was in her house...(she is divorced when he throws the Get in).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> We must say that she is standing next to her house or yard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> No, she may even be in a different city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If she was in her house...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, it is as if she was in her house. Because her house is being guarded for her, she is divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Ula holds that the Torah allows her to receive the Get in her yard because her yard is considered like her hand (it must be near her). R. Oshaya holds that her yard is like her Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all hold that it is like her hand;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ula requires it to be near her, like her hand;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection (on behalf of R. Oshaya):</span> If so, we should require that it be attached to her, as her hand! Rather, it must be guarded for her, like her hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This excludes a yard not guarded for her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>A man threw a Get to his wife in the yard. It fell on a piece of wood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> If the piece is four Amos by four Amos, it is a domain to itself, and she is not divorced. If it is less than this, it is like the yard, and she is divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whose yard is it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is her yard, even if the piece is four by four, she should be divorced!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is his yard, even if the piece is not four by four, she should not be divorced!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he lent to her a place in his yard to acquire the Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One lends only one place. If the wood is like an independent place, he did not lend it as well.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We assumed that the piece of wood is not 10 Tefachim tall. If it is, it is a place unto itself even if it is not four by four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We assumed that the wood does not have a special name. If it does, it is a place unto itself even if it is not four by four and not 10 Tefachim tall.</p>
