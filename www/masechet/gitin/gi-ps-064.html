<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WITNESSES REQUIRED FOR DIVORCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman told a Shali'ach 'receive my Get for me', to remarry, she needs two pairs of witnesses:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Two witnesses must testify that they heard her command the Shali'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Two witnesses must testify that they saw the Shali'ach receive the Get and tear it up (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The same two people can testify about both of these.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Alternatively, three witnesses may testify, if one saw the command, one saw the reception and tearing, and one saw both of these.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> If Reuven gave a Get to Shimon, and Reuven says that he asked him only to watch it, and Shimon says that Reuven told him to give it to Reuven's wife, who is believed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> Reuven is believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Chisda):</span> Shimon is believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Huna believes the husband. Had he wanted to divorce his wife, he would have given it himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Chisda believes Shimon. Since he gave the Get to him, Reuven trusted Shimon for whatever Shimon will say.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba, against Rav Huna - Beraisa):</span> A litigant's admission is like 100 witnesses. A third party (with whom the document was deposited) is believed more than either litigant.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the litigants argue, we rely on what the third party says.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Money matters are different. There, we can say that by trusting him with the document, they forfeited their money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The same applies to Gitin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to monetary Gitin (documents).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The same applies to documents. (Therefore, 'Gitin' must refer to documents of divorce!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> These are two separate Beraisos teaching the same thing (monetary documents).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Chisda - Mishnah):</span> If a woman told a Shali'ach 'receive my Get for me', to remarry, she needs two pairs of witnesses, one pair who heard her command, and two who saw the Shali'ach receive the Get and tear it up.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are witnesses needed? Why can't we believe the Shali'ach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> He is believed only when he is holding the Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand why she needs witnesses who heard the command. Why does she need witnesses who saw him get the Get?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Mishnah is like R. Eliezer, who says that Edei Mesirah Karsei (a Get is empowered by the witnesses who saw it given).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do they tear the Get?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> This Mishnah was taught when there were decrees (by the Nochrim) forbidding Gitin (and other Mitzvos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> Rav Huna admits that if she says that the Shali'ach told her that he was authorized to give the Get, she is believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It cannot be that the Shali'ach is not believed to say this, but she is believed to say it in his name!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if she says that she saw her husband authorize the Shali'ach to give it, she is believed, for she could have said that she received it from her husband. (Had she made this latter claim, she would be believed.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MAY WE RELY ON A <i>SHALI'ACH</i> TO FULFILL HIS MISSION?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If Reuven says that he told the Shali'ach to give the Get, and the Shali'ach says that he gave it, and she says that she received it and lost it, since matters involving marriage require two witnesses and we do not have two witnesses, we cannot permit her to remarry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't we believe the Shali'ach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is believed only when he is holding the Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't we believe the husband?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> If a man says that he divorced his wife, he is believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The husband does not know whether or not the Get was given.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't we rely on the Chazakah that a Shali'ach fulfills his mission?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> If Levi told Shimon 'be Mekadesh a woman to me', and Shimon went away and died, Levi is forbidden to marry any woman, because there is a Chazakah that a Shali'ach fulfills his mission. (We must be concerned lest Shimon was Mekadesh (to Levi) the sister (or another close relative) of whomever Levi wants to marry!)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">64b----------------------------------------64b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not rely on the Chazakah to be lenient, only to be stringent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't we believe Reuven's wife (that she received and lost the Get)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> If a woman says to her husband 'you divorced me', she is believed. It is established that a woman could not be so brazen to lie to her husband about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here is different, for the Shali'ach supports her. This enables her to lie.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ACQUISTIONS OF MINORS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Na'arah Me'urasah (during Eirusin) or her father can receive her Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, the Torah never authorizes two people to acquire the same matter. Only her father can receive it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Any girl who cannot guard her Get cannot be divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim say that the Torah gave her an additional way to receive her Get (i.e. through her father). R. Yehudah holds that her own power to receive does not work when she is in her father's Reshus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any girl who cannot guard her Get cannot be divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A minor can be divorced only if she knows to guard her Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Knowing to guard her Get' is if she guards her Get and something else.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> (If she loses her Get,) she guards something else, and thinks that it is her Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Huna bar Mano'ach):</span> That is a lunatic!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Huna bar Mano'ach):</span> She can distinguish between her Get and something else.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah, citing Rav Asi):</span> If a child knows to discard a rock but keep a nut, he can acquire for himself, but not for others;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one can deposit an item with him and he will return it later, he can acquire for himself and for others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Both of these children have the same law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Shmuel mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> Either can acquire for himself, but not for others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Chisda - Rav Chinena Vardan - Mishnah):</span> To make Shituf Mavo'os (an Eruv to allow carrying in an alleyway on Shabbos), one designates a barrel of wine for all members of the Mavoy. Someone acquires on their behalf;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The following can acquire - the donor's adult son or daughter, and his Eved or Amah ha'Ivriyim (male or female Yisrael slaves).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of his Amah?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> (After 12 years,) she brought hairs (of adulthood).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so she is free, she is not his slave!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, she is still a minor. The Mishnah says that she can acquire for others!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shituf Mavo'os is mid'Rabanan. Chachamim were lenient to allow her to acquire, but mid'Oraisa, she cannot acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Rav Chinena was silent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What could he have said?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All decrees of Chachamim were patterned on mid'Oraisa laws.</p>
