<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FINING UNINTENTIONAL TRANSGRESSERS OF TORAH LAWS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (for R. Meir):</span> Yisre'elim are suspected to transgress Shemitah, but not to transgress Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the second answer needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that sometimes the 30th day before Shemitah is Shabbos, and people will remember that a tree was planted on that day (so that the 30 days will be considered the first of the three years of Orlah, in which the fruits are forbidden). The Beraisa teaches that Yisrael are not suspected to transgress Shabbos, so we are not concerned for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (for R. Yehudah):</span> In R. Yehudah's area, people were very stringent about Shemitah (so we are not concerned lest they transgress).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A man in R. Yehudah's area was insulted. He retorted by saying 'at least I don't eat (forbidden) Peros of Shemitah like you do!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a non-Kohen ate Tamei Terumah (b'Shogeg), he pays an equal quantity of Tahor Chulin (it becomes Terumah). If he paid with Tamei Chulin:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sumchus cites R. Meir to say that if this was Shogeg, it is valid payment. If he was Mezid, it is not valid payment;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, in either case, it is payment (it becomes Terumah), but he must also pay Tahor Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (According to R. Meir) when he gave Tamei Chulin b'Mezid, why is it invalid? He ate something totally unfit for the Kohen, and paid something (Rashi - he thought would be; Tosfos - at the time was Chulin, and) permitted for the Kohen to eat when he is Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Beraisa is abbreviated. It should say as follows. If he ate Tamei Terumah, he pays back Chulin. It may be Tahor or Tamei. If he ate Tahor Terumah, he pays back Tahor Chulin;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he paid Tamei Chulin, Sumchus cites R. Meir to say that if this was Shogeg, it is valid payment. If he was Mezid, it is not payment;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim say, in either case it is payment, but he must also pay Tahor Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Culmination of question - Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> R. Meir holds that we do not fine Shogeg due to Mezid, and Chachamim say that we do!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There the man intended to fulfill his Mitzvah to pay. R. Meir does not fine one who was engaged in a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If blood of a Korban became Tamei and was thrown on the Mizbe'ach, if it was b'Shogeg, the Korban may be eaten. If it was b'Mezid, the Korban is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There the man intended to get atonement. It is improper to fine him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If one tithed food on Shabbos b'Shogeg, the food may be eaten. If he was Mezid, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There the man intended to make his food permissible. It is improper to fine him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If one immersed Kelim on Shabbos b'Shogeg, he may use them. If he was Mezid, he may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There the man intended to be Metaher his Kelim. It is not fitting to fine him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FINING UNINTENTIONAL TRANSGRESSERS OF RABBINIC LAWS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Elsewhere, R. Yehudah fines about mid'Rabanan laws!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">54b----------------------------------------54b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir and R. Yehudah):</span> (There was a mixture of forbidden Parech nuts, i.e. an esteemed species, with permitted nuts. Whole Parech nuts are never Batel in a mixture.) The nuts fell and broke. Whether this was Shogeg or Mezid, the mixture is still forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi and R. Shimon say, if they fell b'Shogeg, the nuts can become Batel (in the proper amount of permitted nuts). If they fell b'Mezid, they are not Batel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Mid'Oraisa, any minority is Batel. Mid'Rabanan, a minority of important things is not Batel, and R. Yehudah fines!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, he fines lest the person scheme to make them fall so they will become Batel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> There, R. Yosi fines one who was Mezid. Elsewhere, he does not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one has a tree of Orlah or Kilai ha'Kerem (a forbidden crossbreed in a vineyard), and cannot remember which tree this is, he may not harvest his trees. (A tree cannot become Batel, but the Peros can. Normally, Kil'ai ha'Kerem is evident! Perhaps a sapling grew b'Isur in a vineyard and was replanted among similar trees. Alternatively, a vine was growing next to a tree in an orchard, forbade the tree, and the vine was removed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he harvested the trees, and he knows that there are more than 200 times as much permitted Peros as forbidden Peros, the latter are Batel, provided that he did not intend for this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yosi says, even if he intended for this, the forbidden Peros are Batel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava and Ravin):</span> Normally, one would be careful not to allow one tree to forbid all his trees, and he would clearly designate the forbidden tree. This case is rare, so R. Yosi makes no fine.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN IS ONE WITNESS BELIEVED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kohen was Mefagel (disqualified a Korban through intent to eat or offer some of it outside the allowed time or place) b'Mezid, he must pay for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven was working with Shimon's Taharos (Tahor food or Kelim) and he told Shimon that they became Tamei, he is believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The same applies if he was offering Shimon's Korban and he told him that it became Pigul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he tells him 'your food or Korban that I worked with on a previous day became Tamei or Pigul', he is not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he believed only in the Reisha?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> He is believed only when it is b'Yado (he could make it Tamei or Pigul) at the time he tells him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Reuven is not believed when he did not tell Shimon the first time he saw him (after, according to Reuven, it became Tamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> If Levi told David 'the Peros that we were working with the other day became Tamei', letter of the law he is not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Asi citing R. Yochanan citing R. Yosi):</span> The Torah believes him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where does the Torah say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak bar Bisna):</span> We learn from the Chata'os offered in the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim on Yom Kipur. (Tosfos - we know that every Korban can become disqualified due to Pigul through any of its four Avodos with the blood.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could we know that they became Pigul (through throwing the blood)? "No (other) man will be in the Ohel Mo'ed (when the Kohen Gadol offers these)"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that the Kohen Gadol is believed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps from outside we heard him say that he sprinkles with intent to burn the Chelev on the Mizbe'ach after the allowed time!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We would not know that he said this when he sprinkled. Perhaps he said this after sprinkling!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps someone saw the Kohen Gadol through an opening in the wall of the Heichal (and knows that he said this while sprinkling)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>This is left difficult. (Chasam Sofer DH Kohen - if one witness were not believed, they would have needed to build an opening. The Gemara initially assumed that no opening was built, and later challenged this.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHEN IS A SCRIBE BELIEVED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A scribe said 'the Sefer Torah that I wrote for Ploni is Pasul because I wrote the occurrences of Hash-m's name Lo Lishmah (without intent).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Ami:</span> Who has the Sefer Torah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">The scribe:</span> Ploni has it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Ami:</span> You forfeit your wages through your admission, but you are not believed to disqualify the Sefer Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Granted, he is not paid for writing those names, but he should get paid for writing the rest!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami):</span> Since the names are not Lishmah, the Sefer Torah is worthless.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't he overwrite the names with intention to sanctify them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Ami holds like Chachamim who argue with R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> In a place where Hash-m's name must be written, a scribe mistakenly thought that he needs to write 'Yehudah.' He omitted the 'Daled' (it turns out that he wrote Hash-m's name without intent). He overwrites the letters with intention to make them Kodesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, this is not a nice writing of Hash-m's name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Ami could even hold like R. Yehudah. R. Yehudah permits overwriting His name once, but not every place it occurs, for such a Sefer appears spotted. (Chasam Sofer - R. Yirmeyah thought that he can overwrite the names Lishmah. Even though this will not permit it for Kri'as ha'Torah b'Tzibur, it may be used to teach children. R. Ami answered that even then, it must be buried.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>A scribe said 'the Sefer Torah that I wrote for Ploni is Pasul because I did not tan the hide for the parchments Lishmah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">R. Avahu:</span> Who has the Sefer Torah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">The scribe:</span> Ploni has it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">R. Avahu:</span> Since you are believed to forfeit your wages, you are also believed to disqualify the Sefer Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different than R. Ami's case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, one can say that the scribe really wrote it Lishmah, but he thought that he could disqualify the Sefer and still receive most of his wages, like R. Yirmeyah thought. Here, the scribe knows that he forfeits his entire wage. Presumably, he is telling the truth! (Even in this case, the scribe would receive the value of a Chumash that one may learn from, but this is very small compared to the value of a Kosher Sefer Torah.)</p>
