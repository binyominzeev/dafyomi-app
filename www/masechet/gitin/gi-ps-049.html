<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>COLLECTION OF DAMAGES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Yishmael holds that we assess (what is called Idis) according to the victim's land. R. Akiva says that it is according to the damager's land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yishmael's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "field" later (in the Parshah), and also earlier;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like the first time it refers to the victim's field (being consumed), also the latter time (the payments will be like the Idis of that field).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Akiva expounds "from the best of his field he will pay" - the field of the one paying.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yishmael learns from a Gezeirah Shavah and from this verse.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He learns from the above Gezeirah Shavah (Sadeh-Sadeh).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The verse also teaches that if the damager has Idis and Ziburis, and his Ziburis is not as good like the Idis of the victim, he must pay with his Idis (even if it is better than the Idis of the victim).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DAMAGES TO <i>HEKDESH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> The verse teaches only that damages are collected from Idis, all the more so regarding Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When does the Kal va'Chomer to Hekdesh apply?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A man's ox gored an ox of Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> One pays when his ox gores "the ox of his fellow man", not an ox of Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, a man said 'it is upon me to give a Maneh to Hekdesh.' The Gizbar (treasurer of Hekdesh) collects from the man's Idis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, the Gizbar is like a creditor, who collects Beinonis!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps R. Akiva holds that a creditor collects Idis, like damages.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (Even if this were true,) we could not learn from a creditor to Hekdesh. A creditor collects from Idis, for he is stronger: he collects damages. Hekdesh should not collect from Idis, for it does not collect damages!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, a man's ox gored an ox of Hekdesh. R. Akiva holds like R. Shimon ben Menasiya.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Menasiya):</span> If a Hekdesh ox gored a Yisrael's ox, Hekdesh does not pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a Yisrael's ox, even if it is Tam (it is not established to gore), gored a Hekdesh ox, it pays full damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why must we say that R. Akiva argues with R. Yishmael when the Idis of the victim is like the Ziburis of the damager?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps all agree that payments are like the Idis of the victim. They argue only about damages to Hekdesh! R. Akiva holds like R. Shimon ben Menasiya, and R. Yishmael holds like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> (This cannot be, for) if so, why did R. Akiva say 'the verse teaches only'? (This implies that he argues about how to explain the verse of damages!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> If so, what is the Kal va'Chomer to Hekdesh? (Rashi - if also R. Akiva is lenient about damages, that one need not pay better than the victim's Idis, we cannot learn to be stringent about Hekdesh! Tosfos - why does R. Akiva try to convince R. Yishmael that one pays Idis to Hekdesh? R. Yishmael totally exempts one whose cow damaged Hekdesh! R. Shlomo - we can never know that Hekdesh has no land better than the damager's Idis, so in any case the damager must give his own Idis!)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">49b----------------------------------------49b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection #3 (Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> "From the best of his field and vineyard he will pay" refers to the best field and vineyard of the victim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva says "from the best of his field and vineyard" - of the damager.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ANOTHER EXPLANATION OF THE MISHNAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to question 3:g, 48b - Ravina):</span> Really, the Mishnah is like R. Akiva, who says that we assess Idis based on the damager's land. The Mishnah is also like R. Shimon, who derives laws based on the reasons for Mitzvos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The reason the Torah said that damages are collected from Idis is for Tikun ha'Olam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Damages are collected from Idis due to robbers and extortionists;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Such people will be discouraged from stealing when they realize that Beis Din may later take their best property for payment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim based the law on "from the best of his field and the best of his vineyard he will pay."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa):</span> Creditors collect from (only) Beinonis in order that one who covets his friend's choice property will not lend to him, intending to collect the property.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Chachamim should have enacted that they collect from Ziburis!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, borrowers would not find people to lend to them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah says, a Kesuvah is collected from Ziburis;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Meir says, it is collected from Beinonis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Shimon says, the Kesuvah is collected from Ziburis, for a woman wants to marry more than a man does;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, a woman is divorced willingly or unwillingly, but a man divorces only willingly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that just like Chachamim enacted that she receives a Kesuvah when he divorces her, they should enacted a Kesuvah for him when she (vexed him, and) forced the divorce. R. Shimon teaches that a man is never forced to divorce. He can delay giving a Get.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>COLLECTION OF A <i>KESUVAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Kesuvah is collected from Ziburis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Nachman):</span> This applies only when she collects from orphans. A divorcee collects from her ex-husband from Beinonis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Anyone who collects from orphans collects Ziburis. Why did the Mishnah specify a Kesuvah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who collects land from orphans receives Ziburis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah says that a Kesuvah is collected from Ziburis even when she collects from her ex-husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, it teaches that she collects from orphans from Ziburis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that we let her collect better land to encourage marriage. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> R. Meir says, she collects from Beinonis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> From whom does she collect Beinonis?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is from orphans.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Surely, R. Meir agrees that one who collects land from orphans receives Ziburis!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is from her ex-husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This shows that Chachamim who argue with R. Meir say that she gets Ziburis from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, she collects Beinonis from orphans, to encourage marriage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> Damages are collected from Idis. A creditor collects from Beinonis. A Kesuvah is collected from Ziburis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> From whom are these collected?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They are from the orphans.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, all would collect from Ziburis!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, they are from the debtor (regarding a Kesuvah, the ex-husband) himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> No, they collect from the debtor. The case is, a man became an Arev for his son's damages, debts and (his son's wife's) Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Everyone collects like he is entitled to. The damaged party and creditor normally collect in the lifetime of the son. The father pays them like the son would have;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Kesuvah was destined to be collected from the orphans after the husband's death. The father pays as orphans, from Ziburis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> An Arev for a Kesuvah need not pay it! (The Gemara will explain why.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the father accepted to be a Kablan (an Arev whom the creditor may ask to pay before he asks the borrower to pay).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that a Kablan becomes obligated even if the borrower has no property. According to the opinion that a Kablan becomes obligated only if the borrower has property, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The son had property. Later, it was flooded.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> One is willing to obligate himself for his son's debts even if the son has no property.</p>
