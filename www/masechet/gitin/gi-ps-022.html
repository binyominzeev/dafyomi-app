<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A <i>GET</i> ON SOMETHING GROWING IN A FLOWERPOT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>If Reuven owns a flowerpot and Shimon owns what is growing in it, and Reuven sells the pot to Shimon, Shimon can acquire it through Meshichah (taking it to his property);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon sells what is growing inside to Reuven, Reuven can acquire only through Chazakah on the vegetation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven owns a flowerpot and what is growing in it, and he sells both to Shimon, Shimon can acquire both by making Chazakah on the vegetation;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Property without Acharayus (a lender cannot collect from it if the borrower sold it, i.e. Metaltelim) can be acquired along with property with Acharayus (a lender can collect from it even after it was sold, i.e. land), through (a Kinyan on the land, i.e.) money, a document, or Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Shimon makes a Chazakah on the flowerpot, he does not acquire anything, unless he makes Chazakah on the vegetation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If the hole of a flowerpot is in Eretz Yisrael, and the foliage is in Chutz La'aretz, we follow the hole. (It is as if the plant is growing in Eretz Yisrael regarding Ma'aser and other agricultural laws.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We follow the foliage. (It is as if it is growing in Chutz La'aretz.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>They argue only if the plant did not take root in the ground (through the hole. If it did, Rava would agree with Abaye.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> There is no necessity to say this. Tana'im argue about whether we follow the roots or the foliage! (Rava could hold like the Tana who follows the foliage even when it took root!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven owns a garden on a hill, and Shimon owns a garden at the bottom, and vegetables are growing on the incline (the side of the hill), they belong to Reuven;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, they belong to Shimon (even though they are rooted in Reuven's hill)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah itself explains their reasons (they do not argue about following the roots or the foliage):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir says, if Reuven would remove his soil, nothing would grow (so the vegetables are due to him);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, if Shimon would fill his airspace with soil, nothing would grow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> The following Tana'im follow the foliage. (Rava could hold like them!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If a tree is partially in Eretz Yisrael, and partially in Chutz La'aretz, part of every fruit is obligated in Ma'aseros, and part is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, the fruits that grow in Eretz Yisrael are fully obligated. Those that grow in Chutz La'aretz are fully exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Some of the foliage is in Eretz Yisrael, and the rest in Chutz La'aretz (It does not matter whether the roots are totally in Eretz Yisrael or totally in Chutz La'aretz.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, also the roots are partially in Eretz Yisrael, and partially in Chutz La'aretz. (If all the roots were in one place, all would follow them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we follow the roots, R. Shimon ben Gamliel should admit that each fruit is partially obligated and partially exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rocky ground separates the two sides. The nourishment derived from the roots in Eretz Yisrael does not pass to the side in Chutz La'aretz (and vice-versa).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what is Rebbi's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both sides of the tree enter the trunk, and there the nourishment from both sides is mixed together;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi holds that the nourishment mixes even above ground. R. Shimon ben Gamliel holds that it does not mix.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE PARCHMENT FOR WRITING A <i>GET</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah ben Beseira):</span> (We do not write on a parchment that has already been erased...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Asi):</span> There are three hides: Matzah, Chifah and Diftara.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Matzah is a hide that was not salted or treated with flour or gall-nuts;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What law is special to Matzah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah):</span> One who transfers (from a private domain) to a public domain (or carries four Amos in a public domain) a Matzah hide large enough to wrap a small weight is liable for transgressing Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the size of this weight?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is the smallest weight of Pumbadisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Cheifah is a hide that has been salted but not treated with flour or gall-nuts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Cheifah hide is large to write an amulet, and one transfers it to (or carries it four Amos in) a public domain, he is liable for transgressing Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Diftara is a hide that has been salted, and treated only with flour, but not with gall-nuts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Diftara hide is large to write a Get, and one transfers it to (or carries it in) a public domain, he is liable for transgressing Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chachamim permit (erasable parchments).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who are these Chachamim?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> They hold like R. Eliezer, who says that Edei Mesirah Karsei (so we do not care whether or not it is forgeable).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> R. Eliezer only permits this if the witnesses testify immediately about the giving of the Get. If they come within the next 10 days, it is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We are concerned lest there was a Tanai (stipulation) written in the Get, and it was later erased and the witnesses forgot it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even if witnesses come within the next 10 days, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there were a Tanai, the witnesses would remember it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> R. Eliezer permits only Gitin (on forgeable parchment), but not monetary documents.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding monetary documents it says "you will put them in an earthenware Kli, in order that they will last a long time." (They must be unforgeable, so they will be valid for a long time, even after the witnesses forget what was written.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Eliezer permits even monetary documents.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "in order that they will last a long time"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is merely good counsel (to put them in an earthenware Kli).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ANYONE CAN WRITE A <i>GET</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Anyone can write a Get, even a deaf person, lunatic or minor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A woman can write her own Get. A husband can write the receipt (in which his wife admits that she received the Kesuvah), since Kiyum of a document is only through its signatures.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why is the Get of a deaf person, lunatic or minor valid? They lack Da'as (understanding)!</p>
