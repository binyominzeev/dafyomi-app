<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A <i>SHALI'ACH</i> WHO CHANGED HIS MISSION (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> We cannot infer this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Had Rav Nachman discussed when Leah asked Shimon to receive her Get, and Shimon told Reuven that he was asked to bring it, and Reuven said 'Heilach, like she said':</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had Rav Nachman said in this case that once Shimon takes it, she is divorced, we could deduce that he holds that Reuven relies on Leah's words;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had Rav Nachman said that once Shimon gives it to her, she is divorced, we could deduce that he holds that Reuven relies on Shimon's words.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>However, Rav Nachman discussed when Shimon was asked to bring the Get, and he said he was asked to receive it. He did not accept to be a Shali'ach to bring it. This is why she is not divorced! (We cannot deduce on whom Reuven relied. The next three questions are against Rav Nachman.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rav Huna bar Chiya - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'receive this Get for my wife' or 'take this Get for my wife', Reuven can retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Inference):</span> (Even when Reuven said 'receive',) had Reuven not retracted, the Get would be valid, even though a husband cannot make a Shali'ach to receive a Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We must say that once he seeks to divorce her, he wants to divorce her in any way possible. Here also (when he tells the Shali'ach, 'Heilach like she said'), we should say that that is his intention!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> You cannot learn from the Mishnah. There, a man knows that he cannot make a Shali'ach to receive, so he intended to make Shimon a Shali'ach to give it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, he was tricked (he thought that Shimon was a Shali'ach to receive)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rava - Mishnah):</span> If a minor said 'receive my Get for me', she is not divorced until it reaches her hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Her husband didn't explicitly authorize the Shali'ach to give the Get. We must say that once he seeks to divorce her, he wants to divorce her in any way possible!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The same applies when the Shali'ach lied to him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Also there, a man knows that a minor cannot make a Shali'ach to receive a Get, therefore her husband intended to make him a Shali'ach to give it. In our case, the husband errs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #3 (Beraisa):</span> If Leah asked Shimon to bring her Get, and he told Reuven that he was asked to receive it; or, if Leah asked Shimon to receive her Get, and he told Reuven that he was asked to bring it, and Reuven said 'take it and give it to her' or 'acquire for her' or 'receive for her', he can retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Once she gets the Get, she is divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Reuven said 'receive for her' when Shimon said that he is a Shali'ach to receive it. Reuven said 'take it and give it to her' when Shimon said that he is a Shali'ach to bring it. (Rav Nachman would say that in the former case, even when she gets the Get, she is not divorced!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, Reuven said 'receive for her' when Shimon said that he was told to bring it. Reuven said 'take it and give it to her', when Shimon said he was told to receive it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Reuven said 'receive for her' when Shimon said that he was told to bring it (and he was really told to receive it), she should be divorced immediately! Why does the Beraisa allow him to retract until it gets to her hand?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that the husband relies on what the Shali'ach tells him! (Why was Rav Ashi (b:1,2) unsure about this?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> In the Beraisa, he did not say 'Heilach, like she said.' In Rav Nachman's case, he said this. Perhaps he relies on what she said!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IS <i>'HEILACH'</i> LIKE SAYING <i>'ZECHI'</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Leah asked Shimon to receive her Get, and he told this to Reuven, and Reuven said 'take it and give it to her', 'Zechi (acquire) for her', or 'receive for her', he cannot retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Nasan says, when he says 'take it and give it to her', he can retract. When he says 'Zechi', or 'receive for her', he cannot retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rebbi says, in all these cases he cannot retract. If he said 'I do not want you to receive for her. Rather, take it and give it to her', he can retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rebbi is like the first Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rebbi teaches about when Reuven says 'I do not want you to receive for her. Rather,...'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Seifa reveals that the first Tana is Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Nasan hold that 'Heilach' is like 'Zechi'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven told a Shali'ach 'receive this Get for my wife' or 'take this Get for my wife', Reuven can retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Leah told a Shali'ach 'receive this Get for me' (and Reuven gave it to him), Reuven cannot retract.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">63b----------------------------------------63b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Reuven said 'Heilach'. The Mishnah is like R. Nasan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, he said 'take it.' It is like Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> Therefore, if Reuven told Levi 'I don't want you to receive it for her. Rather, Holech (take it) and give it to her' (and he gave it to him), he can retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Inference):</span> This is only because Reuven said 'I don't want...' If not, he could not retract!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This teaches that saying 'Holech' is like saying 'receive'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The text of the Mishnah says 'Heilach'; the Mishnah is like R. Nasan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it says 'Holech.' It is like Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa):</span> If one said 'Holech this Get to my wife', he can retract. If he said 'Heilach this Get to my wife', he cannot retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Nasan is the Tana who says that he can retract when he says Holech. This shows that R. Nasan holds that he cannot retract when he says Heilach, for this is like saying 'Zechi'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba citing Rav):</span> If Leah asked Shimon to receive her Get, and he told this to Reuven, who said 'Holech and give it to her', (his intent is unclear, so) Shimon is a (Safek) Shali'ach of Reuven and of Leah. If Reuven died, she must do Chalitzah, but not Yibum (perhaps she was divorced immediately).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Here, Rav is unsure whether saying 'Holech' is like saying 'Zechi'. Elsewhere, he is sure that it is!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If Reuven said 'Holech this money that I owe to Shimon', if the money does not reach Shimon, Reuven still owes the money. Reuven cannot tell the Shali'ach 'I retract. Return the money to me.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There also, Rav is unsure. When in doubt about monetary laws, we keep the status quo (Reuven cannot retract). Regarding Isurim (such as divorce), we are stringent.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CAN A <i>SHALI'ACH</i> GIVE THE <i>GET</i> TO A <i>SHALI'ACH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> A woman cannot make a Shali'ach to receive her Get from her husband's Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> She can make a Shali'ach for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rav's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This is a disgrace to the husband (that she does not take it herself). We assume that he did not authorize his Shali'ach to give the Get in such a manner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> This is a decree due to when she acquires a field in which the Get was placed. (In that case, her husband did not give the Get to her. She took it, which is invalid.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to this, if she made her Shali'ach before the husband made his, there is no decree. According to Answer #1, the Get is Pasul also in this case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Reuven sent a Get to his wife; the Shali'ach found her kneading. She told the Shali'ach to receive the Get for her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> If the Halachah followed R. Chanina, I would rule that the Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Why? The Shali'ach accepted another mission before finishing his first mission (which is Pasul)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Ami agreed with Rava. R. Chiya bar Aba requested more time to think about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya bar Aba:</span> I am still in doubt. In doubtful rulings involving forbidden Bi'ah, (we are stringent. If the husband died in the meantime,) she does Chalitzah, and not Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A case occurred, and R. Yitzchak bar Shmuel bar Marsa required a Get and Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could both be needed? Get applies only if the husband is alive, and Chalitzah applies only if he is dead!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He ruled that if he is alive, she needs a Get to remarry. If he is dead, she needs Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CAN WITNESSES WRITE ANOTHER <i>GET</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A Get was written for a woman called Nafasa; on the Get they wrote 'Tafasa'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (R. Yitzchak bar Shmuel bar Marsa):</span> The witnesses did their mission. (They were appointed to write only one Get. They cannot write another one without a new appointment.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rabah):</span> They were appointed to write a valid Get. They did not do this yet!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (Rabah):</span> If they wrote a Get and it was lost, they cannot write another one without a new appointment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman):</span> They were not appointed to write a Get and hold onto it. Their mission was to write and give a Get, they did not do this yet!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #3 (Rav Nachman):</span> They may write and give even 100 Gitin (until they give a valid Get).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If witnesses were asked to write a Get and gave it to the husband's Shali'ach, and the Shali'ach lost it, can the witnesses write another Get?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps they cannot for they already fulfilled their mission;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps their mission was to divorce his wife. He suggested giving it to his Shali'ach only to make their job easier!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> (If you will say that they fulfilled their mission,) if he said 'and take it to her', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven's wife told a Shali'ach 'receive my Get for me' (and Reuven gave it to him) - Reuven cannot retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Whether she said 'take', 'carry', or 'let it be my Get in your hands', she authorized the Shali'ach to receive it.</p>
