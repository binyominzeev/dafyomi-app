<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>UNNOTICEABLE DAMAGE (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav explain like Shmuel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mixing wine is just like mixing Peros with Terumah. The Mishnah would not teach this case twice.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shmuel holds that we can not derive one fine from another. Each must be taught by itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav holds that we can derive fines from one another. Why must the Mishnah teach these three cases?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn mixing Terumah with Chulin from being Metamei:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If (the case is) he was Metamei Terumah, he renders it totally inedible. We could not learn to mixing Terumah and Chulin (the mixture is permitted to a Kohen);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he was Metamei Chulin, perhaps we were more stringent there, because it is forbidden to be Metamei Chulin in Eretz Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We could not learn the fine for being Metamei from that for mixing Terumah and Chulin, for the latter is more common;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>From these two fines, we could not learn about Menasech. One might have thought that he is exempt because he is Chayav Misah. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so, for R. Yirmeyah's reason.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin's father):</span> At first, they taught about (liability of) one who was Metamei or Menasech (another's Peros or wine, b'Mezid). Later, they taught about even one who mixes with Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must all these cases be taught?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One is not Chayav Misah for being Metamei, so we could not learn to Menasech (one might have thought that he is exempt from paying because he is Chayav Misah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We could not learn from Menasech, which renders the wine worthless, to being Metamei, in which case the Peros retains some value;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We could not learn from these two cases, in which there is a large loss (it cannot be eaten), to the case of mixing Terumah and Chulin, which causes only a small loss.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOES THE TORAH OBLIGATE PAYMENT FOR UNNOTICEABLE DAMAGE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> Mid'Oraisa, one is obligated whether he caused unnoticeable damage b'Shogeg or b'Mezid. The Torah considers it damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It was a Rabbinical enactment to exempt one who damaged b'Shogeg, in order that he will tell the victim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the same enactment should apply to one who damaged b'Mezid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he damaged b'Mezid, surely he will tell him. His whole purpose was to cause him a loss!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Mid'Oraisa, one is exempt whether he caused unnoticeable damage b'Shogeg or b'Mezid. The Torah does not consider it to be damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It was a Rabbinical enactment to obligate one who damaged b'Mezid, to deter people from being Metamei each other's Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kohen was Mefagel (intended to eat or offer a Korban in a forbidden time or place, which disqualifies the Korban) b'Mezid, he must pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This is an enactment for Tikun ha'Olam. (The following questions are against Chazakah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If unnoticeable damage is considered damage, the Beraisa should teach that b'Shogeg he is exempt, due to an enactment for Tikun ha'Olam!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is what the Beraisa means! If he was Mezid, he is liable. If he was Shogeg, he is exempt. This is an enactment for Tikun ha'Olam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar - Beraisa):</span> If one used Mei Chatas (water on which ashes of the red heifer were put) or a Parah Adumah itself (thereby disqualifying them), he is exempt b'Yedei Adam (Beis Din does not make him pay), but he is liable b'Yedei Shamayim (at the hands of Heaven).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If unnoticeable damage is considered damage, he should be liable b'Yedei Adam!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> The case is, he brought a Parah Adumah into the pen so it should nurse and thresh, or used the water. (It is disqualified only due to his intent. Beis Din cannot make someone pay for damage due to intent.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava taught that if one used Mei Chatas to weigh something, the water is still valid!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">53b----------------------------------------53b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rava discusses weighing something against the water (e.g. on the other side of a balance scale). R. Elazar discusses when the water itself was used (e.g. meat was 'weighed' by placing it in a full Kli of water and measuring how much spilled out).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If an action was done with the water itself, if unnoticeable damage is considered damage, he should be liable b'Yedei Adam!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> In both cases, he weighed against the water. The water is disqualified only if he took his mind off of guarding it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa - Mishnah):</span> In the following cases, a thief may return the stolen object and need not compensate for the loss:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He stole a coin, and it became disqualified; he stole Terumah, and it became Teme'ah; he stole Chametz, and Pesach came (forbidding benefit from it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If unnoticeable damage is considered damage, since he is a thief, he should need to compensate for the loss!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Chizkiyah is refuted. (Really, we will shows that Tana'im argue about this. The Gemara says that he is refuted because the Halachah does not follow him.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FINING UNINTENTIONAL DUE TO INTENTIONAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about unnoticeable damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven made Shimon's Peros Tamei, or mixed Shimon's Peros with Terumah, or was Menasech, whether he did this b'Mezid or not, he must pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, if he did this b'Shogeg, he is exempt. If he was Mezid, he must pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Meir holds that unnoticeable damage is considered damage, and R. Yehudah holds that it is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection: (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> No, all hold that unnoticeable damage is not considered damage. R. Meir holds that we fine one who damaged b'Shogeg due to one who damages b'Mezid (lest one say that he was Shogeg). R. Yehudah does not make such a fine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> R. Meir and R. Yehudah both hold just the opposite!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If one cooked on Shabbos b'Shogeg, he may eat it. If he was Mezid, he may not eat it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, if he was Shogeg, he may eat it after Shabbos. If he was Mezid, he may never eat it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yochanan ha'Sandlar says, if he was Shogeg, after Shabbos others may eat it, but he may not. If he was Mezid, even others may never eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (part 1):</span> R. Meir does not contradict himself. He fines Shogeg due to Mezid regarding mid'Rabanan Isurim, but not regarding Torah Isurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Menasech is a Torah Isur, and R. Meir fines!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is an exception. He fines it due to the severity of idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (part 2):</span> R. Yehudah does not contradict himself. He fines Shogeg due to Mezid regarding mid'Oraisan Isurim, but not regarding mid'Rabanan Isurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Menasech is mid'Oraisa, and R. Yehudah does not fine!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is an exception. He need not fine it, because people refrain from this anyway because of the severity of idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Elsewhere, R. Meir fines Shogeg due to Mezid regarding mid'Oraisa laws (and R. Yehudah does not)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If one planted on Shabbos b'Shogeg, he may let it grow. If he was Mezid, he must uproot it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he planted in Shemitah, whether he was Shogeg or Mezid he must uproot it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, if he planted in Shemitah b'Shogeg, he may let it grow. If he was Mezid, he must uproot it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he planted on Shabbos, whether he was Shogeg or Mezid, he must uproot it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> In that Beraisa itself, R. Meir (and R. Yehudah) are inconsistent. Shabbos and Shemitah are both mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (for R. Meir - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> One who planted in Shemitah must uproot it, because Yisre'elim count the years of Shemitah. (When people see him redeem the fruit (it has Kedushas Revai) in the fourth year, they will know that the tree was planted in Shemitah, and they will assume that this is permitted);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There is no such concern regarding Shabbos, so he may let the tree grow.</p>
