May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah.<BR>&nbsp;<BR><br>12th CYCLE DEDICATION<br>GITIN 29 (8 Av) - Dedicated in honor of the second Yahrzeit of Mrs. Lily (Leah bas Pinchas) Kornfeld, a holocaust survivor who met all of life's challenges with courage and fortitude, by her daughter and son-in-law Diane and Andy Koenigsberg and family. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN WE ASSUME THAT SOMEONE WAS EXECUTED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> This applies only to a court of Nochrim. Regarding a Beis Din of Yisrael, once they passed sentence, surely they will kill him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> A Beis Din of Yisrael may find a reason to declare him innocent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> It is not common to find that he is innocent after there was already a verdict that he was guilty. We are not concerned for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Yosef - Mishnah):</span> If two witnesses say that Ploni was sentenced to die, and they name the Beis Din and witnesses who convicted him, we kill Ploni.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the case of one who fled is different.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If someone heard a Beis Din of Yisrael say that Ploni 'Mes' or 'Neherag', we permit his wife to remarry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he heard Nochri executioners saying this, we do not permit her to remarry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do 'Mes' and 'Neherag' mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He already died, or was killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, his wife should be permitted to remarry even if a Nochri executioner said this!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If anyone mentions a person's death l'Fi Tumo, we rely on this to permit his wife to remarry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, it means that Ploni's sentence is that Beis Din will cause his death, or will directly kill him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In such a case, regarding a Beis Din of Yisrael, we permit his wife to remarry - this shows, we are sure he was killed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, it means that he already died or was killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Normally, if anyone says l'Fi Tumo that Ploni died, we rely on this to permit his wife to remarry. We do not rely on the words of a Nochri executioner.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is because Nochrim pride themselves that they judged properly, and are prone to lie!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CAN A <i>SHALI'ACH</i> MAKE ANOTHER <i>SHALI'ACH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven appointed Shimon to give a Get within Eretz Yisrael, and Shimon got sick, Shimon can appoint a Shali'ach to give the Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven told Shimon to receive something from his wife when he gives the Get, Shimon may not make a Shali'ach. We assume that Reuven does not want his deposit to be in the hands of others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Kahana):</span> The Mishnah discusses when the Shali'ach got sick.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious. The Mishnah says so explicitly!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the law applies even if he did not get sick, and the Mishnah just gives a normal case. Rav Kahana teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did Reuven tell Shimon?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'take this Get', even if Shimon did not get sick, he may make another Shali'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said 'you take this Get', even if Shimon got sick, he cannot make another Shali'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If the Mishnah is like R. Shimon ben Gamliel, even if Shimon got sick, he cannot make another Shali'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'take this Get to my wife', Shimon may make another Shali'ach. If he said 'you take this Get', Shimon cannot make another Shali'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, in either case, he cannot make another Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> In our Mishnah, Reuven said 'take this Get.' The Beraisa discusses when Shimon got sick.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> In our Mishnah, Reuven said 'you take this Get.' The Beraisa discusses when Shimon is healthy. The law is different when he falls sick.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Shimon ben Gamliel. The Beraisa discusses when Shimon is healthy. The law is different when he falls sick.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven appointed Shimon to give a Get within Eretz Yisrael, and Shimon got sick, Shimon can appoint a Shali'ach to give the Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah #1):</span> If Reuven told two people 'give a Get to my wife', or he told three people 'write and give a Get to my wife', they themselves must write and give. They cannot appoint someone else.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> In Mishnah #1, they cannot make another Shali'ach because the husband is insistent that they do it themselves. He does not want word to spread that he does not know to write a Get himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In our Mishnah, the husband does not care whether or not his Shali'ach gives the Get personally.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> In Mishnah #1, they cannot make another Shali'ach, because Mili cannot be transferred from one Shali'ach to another. (Rishonim argue about whether Mili is a Shelichus in which no object was given to the Shali'ach, or a Shelichus that does not finish the matter, or a Shelichus that depends on the will of others. In our Mishnah, the Shali'ach received a Get to divorce her, and he can do so against her will, so all agree that it is not Mili.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the practical difference between Abaye's answer and Rava's?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about if Reuven asked Sheluchim to write a document to give a gift;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye holds like Rav, who says this is unlike asking them to write and give a Get; (The giver is not expected to write the document himself. There is no embarrassment if someone else writes it, so they may make another Shali'ach.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava holds like Shmuel, who says it is like asking to write a Get. (Also this is Mili. They cannot appoint another Shali'ach.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he said 'take my object from her (when you give the Get)'...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> In our Mishnah, Rebbi taught that one who borrows or rents an object may not lend or rent it to someone else.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Everyone knows that! Rather, Rebbi taught that sometimes, this disqualifies the Get (if the Shali'ach makes another Shali'ach to give the Get and take the object);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is as if he told his Shali'ach 'divorce her only in the house', and the Shali'ach divorced her in the attic, or 'divorce her only using the right hand', and he divorced her using the left hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>Reish Lakish and R. Yochanan agree that if she gave to him the object before he gave the Get, the Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">29b----------------------------------------29b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue when he told his Shali'ach 'take the object, then give the Get', and the Shali'ach gave the Get before she gave the object.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even if the original Shali'ach did this, the Get is Pasul, and all the more so, if the Shali'ach made a second Shali'ach (Rashi - and the second Shali'ach gave the Get before getting the object; Tosfos - even if the second Shali'ach gave the Get after getting the object).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Even if the second Shali'ach did this, the Get is valid, all the more so, if the first Shali'ach did so. (The husband was not particular about the order of giving and receiving.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SHELUCHIM OF SHELUCHIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Shali'ach to bring a Get from abroad got sick, he makes a second Shali'ach in front of a Beis Din, and says 'it was written and signed in front of me.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The last Shali'ach need not make a declaration when he gives the Get. He merely says 'I am a Shali'ach of Beis Din.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Version #1 Question (Rabanan):</span> Can the second Shali'ach can make another Shali'ach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Avimi):</span> That is obvious! The Mishnah says 'the last Shali'ach (need not make a declaration).' This shows that the second Shali'ach can make another Shali'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Avimi):</span> Rather, ask the following. When the second Shali'ach appoints a third Shali'ach, must he do this in Beis Din?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabanan):</span> Clearly, he must! The Mishnah says 'the last Shali'ach says 'I am a Shali'ach of Beis Din''</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak) Question (Rabanan):</span> When the second Shali'ach appoints a third Shali'ach, must he do this in Beis Din?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Avimi):</span> Rather, you should ask whether the second Shali'ach can make a third Shali'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabanan):</span> Clearly, he can! The Mishnah says, the last Shali'ach (need not make a declaration), we see that he can make another Shali'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We are unsure only about whether this must be done in Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Avimi):</span> That is obvious! The Mishnah says that the last Shali'ach must say 'I am a Shali'ach of Beis Din'. This shows that he must be appointed in Beis Din. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> A Shali'ach to give a Get within Eretz Yisrael can make several Sheluchim (i.e. he can make a second Shali'ach, who can make a third...).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> If the first Shali'ach dies, the later Sheluchim cease to be Sheluchim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> My father said this in his youth (i.e. it is wrong);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the husband would die, the mission is void. All are Sheluchim of the husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Therefore, as long as the husband is alive, they are all valid Sheluchim!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ONLY ONE WHO CAN DIVORCE CAN MAKE ANOTHER <i>SHALI'ACH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A case occurred in which Reuven appointed Shimon to give a Get to Reuven's wife.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> Give the Get to Aba bar Minyomi. He knows my wife, and he will give it to her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Shimon did not find Aba. He found R. Avahu, R. Chanina ben Papa, and R. Yitzchak Nafcha. They told him to make his declaration and give to them the Get, and they will give it to Aba.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Safra:</span> Shimon was not a Shali'ach to divorce! He does not stand in place of the husband, so he cannot make a Shali'ach for other than what Reuven told him to!</p>
