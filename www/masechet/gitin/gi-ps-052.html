<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT DO GUARDIANS DO FOR ORPHANS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If orphans asked Reuven to handle their affairs, or their father had appointed him to be a guardian, Reuven must tithe their Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A guardian appointed by their father must swear (that he did not benefit from the estate). One appointed by Beis Din need not swear;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Aba Sha'ul says, one appointed by their father need not swear, but one appointed by Beis Din must swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Contradiction - Beraisa):</span> "You (can tithe)", but partners, sharecroppers, guardians, and one who does not own the Peros cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> A guardian can tithe Peros that the orphans need to eat now. He cannot tithe Peros they do not need now.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> A guardian can tithe Peros the orphans need to eat now. He cannot tithe Peros they do not need now;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>He can sell the following on behalf of the orphans, but only for their current needs - animals, slaves, houses, fields, vineyards, Peros, wine, oil, and flour.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>He buys for them the four species (Lulav...), a Sukah, Tzitzis, and every Mitzvah that has a limit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This comes to include a Shofar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>He buys for them a Sefer Torah, Tefilin, Mezuzos and everything that has a limit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This comes to include a Megilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>We do not pledge their money for Tzedakah, nor to redeem captives, nor for anything without a limit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This includes (that we don't use their money for) consoling mourners.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Guardians may not claim for them in Beis Din for their detriment or benefit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why can't they claim for their benefit?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if they claimed intending to benefit the orphans, if the verdict hurts the orphans, it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Guardians cannot sell lands that are far away to redeem nearby property, nor sell bad property to redeem good property.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps the property they redeem will be flooded (and it will turn out that this was detrimental for the orphans).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>They may not sell fields to buy slaves, but they may sell slaves to buy fields;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, they may not sell slaves to buy fields, lest the purchase be contested.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>They may not set slaves free, but they may sell the slaves to others who will set them free;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Rebbi says, the slave may pay his own value to redeem himself. This is like selling the slave to himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>The guardian must make a calculation with the orphans when they grow up (and swear that he has not kept any of their money);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, he need not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>Beis Din does not appoint women, slaves or minors to be guardians. The father can appoint one of them to be a guardian.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PROTESTING AGAINST GUARDIANS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A guardian in R. Meir's area was selling land to buy slaves. R. Meir did not allow this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir saw in a dream that Hash-m wanted to deplete the estate. He did not change his position, for we do not act based on dreams.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Satan instigated quarrels between two certain people every Erev Shabbos. R. Meir visited them three consecutive weeks on Erev Shabbos, and they made peace with each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir heard the Satan lament that he was deposed from that house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A guardian in R. Yehoshua ben Levi's area was selling land to buy cattle. R. Yehoshua did not protest, for he holds like R. Yosi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> The basis of a house is the wife; the basis of a field is the ox.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Some orphans relied on a certain woman to conduct their affairs. She sold their cow, and their relatives came before Rav Nachman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> The Mishnah teaches that if orphans rely on one to handle their affairs, he is like a guardian.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The relatives:</span> The cow went up in value!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> That is the buyer's gain.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">The relatives:</span> The orphans did not yet receive the money!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> If so, Rav Chanilai bar Idi's law applies.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chanilai):</span> Orphans are like Hekdesh: acquisitions are done with them through money. (Therefore, the cow was not sold yet.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Ravna Ukva was an orphan. Buyers were Moshech his wine (they picked it up, or brought it to their premises) when the price was four. The price rose to six.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Rav Chanilai's law applies. Since they did not give the money, the acquisition is not valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If a buyer was Moshech Peros of orphans, and the price went up, Rav Chanilai's law applies (the sale is invalid);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the price went down, a commoner should not have greater power than Hekdesh (i.e. the orphans, who are like Hekdesh. Just like one who buys from a commoner cannot retract after Meshichah, one who buys from orphans cannot retract after Meshichah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If a guardian was Moshech Peros to buy them for orphans and the price went up, a commoner should not have greater power than Hekdesh (a commoner acquires through Meshichah, and owes the value at that moment. The same applies to orphans.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If the price went down, seemingly, Rav Chanilai's law should apply (and the sale is invalid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> No, this would be bad for the orphans;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sometimes orphans need to buy Peros, but do not have money. If the law is that the sale is invalid if the price goes down, no one will sell to them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>If orphans gave money to buy Peros, and the price went down, a commoner should not have greater power than Hekdesh (if a commoner gave money but did not yet do Meshichah, he could retract. Also the orphans can retract).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>If the price went up, seemingly, Rav Chanilai's law should apply (the sale is valid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> No, this would be bad for the orphans;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">52b----------------------------------------52b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the law is that the sale is valid, if there is a fire where the Peros are (in the seller's premises), the seller will not exert himself to save it, since it will be the loss of the orphans. (This is the reason why Chachamim decreed that money does not acquire movable objects.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>If a buyer paid money for Peros of orphans, and the price went up, a commoner should not have greater power than Hekdesh. (One who buys from a commoner does not acquire until Meshichah. The same applies here.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>If the price went down, seemingly, Rav Chanilai's law should apply (the sale is valid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> No, this would be bad for the orphans.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sometimes, orphans need money. If the law is that the buyer cannot retract if the price goes down, no one will pay them before receiving the Peros!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Rav Kahana and I signed a document selling the land of an orphan to pay his head-tax, even though it was not announced that his land was being sold.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Chachamim of Neharde'a taught, that for head-tax, food and burial, we sell property of orphans without announcement.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Amram Tzava'ah was a guardian. The orphans' relatives came in front of Rav Nachman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The relatives:</span> The guardian is using their money to dress nicely!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> This causes people to heed his words (it is good for the orphans).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">The relatives:</span> He is eating and drinking nicely. It must be from their money, for he is not established to be wealthy!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Perhaps he found money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">The relatives:</span> He is causing a loss to their property.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Bring witnesses to testify about this, and I will remove him.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> We remove a guardian who causes a loss to the property.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(D'Vei R. Shilo):</span> We do not remove him.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>The Halachah is, we remove him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHICH GUARDIANS MUST SWEAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A guardian appointed by the orphans' father must swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the guardian not benefited from the father, he would not have agreed to be a guardian. He will not refuse just because he must swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A guardian appointed by Beis Din need not swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is merely helping Beis Din. If he would need to swear, he would refuse to be a guardian.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Aba Sha'ul):</span> The law is the opposite in both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> A guardian appointed by Beis Din gets a reputation for reliability. He would not refrain due to the need to swear, so we impose an oath on him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 2:</span> A guardian appointed by the father need not swear. He accepts merely to help his friend. If he would need to swear, he would refuse to be a guardian.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chanan bar Ami):</span> The Halachah follows Aba Sha'ul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> Both must swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>The Halachah follows him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Tachlifa bar Ma'arava - Beraisa):</span> A guardian appointed by the father must swear, for he is paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Avahu):</span> He is not paid! Rather, he is like one who is paid.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>UNNOTICEABLE DAMAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was Metamei Shimon's Peros, or mixed them with Terumah, or was Menasech (this will be explained) b'Shogeg, he is exempt. If he was Mezid, he must pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav):</span> The case of Menasech is understood simply. He poured wine for a libation to idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> No, he mixed Shimon's wine with Yayin Nesech (wine that was offered to idolatry).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Shmuel explain like Rav?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel holds that in such a case, Reuven would be exempt (since at the time he damages, he is Chayav Misah (liable to death) for serving idolatry).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav holds like R. Yirmeyah, who says that Reuven acquired (responsibility for) Shimon's wine when he picked it up. He is not Chayav Misah until he pours it to the idolatry.</p>
