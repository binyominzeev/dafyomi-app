<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LEAVING PRODUCE FROM WHICH TO TAKE TITHES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one designated produce or money, intending that he can declare some of this produce (or money) to be Terumah or Ma'aser (or the redemption of Ma'aser Sheni) when he wants, he may do so. He may assume that the fruit or money is intact.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Elazar says, if he finds that the fruit or money was lost, he must be concerned for 24 hours (if he relied on it to tithe or redeem produce or Ma'aser Sheni, perhaps the fruit or money was already lost, and the tithing or redemption was invalid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, we must check wine (from which we want to declare tithes) at three times to ensure that it has not spoiled - when the east wind blows after Sukos; when unripe grapes appear on the vines; when unripe grapes start filling up with liquid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> For which 24 hours (are we concerned)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> We are concerned for the last 24 hours before checking and finding that the fruit or money was lost.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Elazar ben Antigonus):</span> For the 24 hours after designating the fruit or money (we assume that it was intact. After that, we are in doubt.)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Elazar):</span> If he finds that the fruit or money was lost, he must be concerned for 24 hours.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like the opinion that we are concerned for the last 24 hours.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to R. Elazar ben Antigonus, it should say that we are concerned until 24 hours after designation!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> This is the opinion of R. Elazar (ben Shamu'a).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar (ben Pedas)):</span> Chachamim argue with R. Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Mikveh was measured and found to be deficient, any food that touched people or Kelim that immersed in the Mikveh is retroactively Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is whether it is in a public or private domain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is clear from the Mishnah that Chachamim argue! Why did R. Elazar need to teach this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that Chachamim meant that the foods are retroactively Tamei for 24 hours. R. Elazar teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> At three times we check...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (The Mishnah discusses) when the east wind blows after Sukos, i.e. after the autumn equinox.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> We sell grain at three times: before seeding, at the time of seeding, and in the two weeks before Pesach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We sell wine at three times - in the two weeks before Pesach, in the two weeks before Shavu'os, and in the two weeks before Sukos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We sell oil after Shavu'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> For what law is this relevant?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> This is for partnerships (one partner may sell at these times, even if the other partner does not want to).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> After the last time, when are they sold?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> They are sold at any time.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE WINDS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of "an east wind Charishis"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> When the east wind blows, it makes furrows in the water (from the word Charishah (plowing)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> This does not explain "the sun shone intensely on Yonah's head and he grew faint"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> When the east wind blows, it is Macharish (silences) all the other winds (negates their cooling effects).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Tachlifa bar Rav Chisda):</span> "Your clothing is warm, when the land is silent from the south" - your clothing is warm when the south wind has been silenced.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The east wind silences the other winds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rav Huna and Rav Chisda were sitting; Geneiva passed by. One of them suggested rising to honor him, for he is learned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The other:</span> Should we stand up for one who instigates arguments?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Geneiva):</span> Four winds blow every day. The north wind accompanies all of them. If not for the north wind, the world could not endure at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The south wind is the harshest. An angel called 'Netz' restrains it. If not, it would destroy the entire world!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The east wind can make a woman miscarry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It even causes pearls in the sea to rot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It even causes semen in the womb to spoil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> All three opinions learned from "it is Yafri (this will be explained) between brothers; an east wind of Hash-m arises from the wilderness and dries up the source..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"It dries up the source" refers to the womb;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"It destroys his spring" refers to semen in the womb;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"It despoils a storehouse of cherished Kelim" refers to pearls of the sea.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of "it is Yafri"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> Even the handle of a shovel Rafya (becomes soft, in the east wind).</p>
