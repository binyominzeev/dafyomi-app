<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ARE COMMONERS SUSPECTED OF SWITCHING?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ben ha'Meshulam):</span> A Chaver kneader may not separate b'Taharah the Chalah from a commoner's dough, but he may knead a dough for him b'Taharah and separate Chalah, and put the Chalah in a Kli that cannot become Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When the commoner comes, he takes the dough and the Chalah. We are not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A Chaver may not separate b'Taharah Terumah from a commoner's olives, but he may harvest his olives for him b'Taharah (i.e. in a way that they do not become Huchshar) and separate Terumah. The Chaver puts the Terumah in his own Kli;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When the commoner comes, he takes the olives and the Terumah. We are not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are we not concerned?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> This is an enactment to support the livelihood of kneaders and olive-pressers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>It is necessary to teach both cases:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only about a kneader, we would think that we are lenient for him because he receives a small wage, but we are stringent about an olive-presser;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only about an olive-presser, we would have thought that we are lenient for him because he is not employed frequently, we are stringent about a kneader.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He puts the Chalah in a special Kli that cannot become Tamei. When the commoner comes, he takes the dough and the Chalah. We are not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest the commoner touch the Chalah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We tell him that if he touches it, it will revert to Tevel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned that he does not care, and will touch it anyway!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This commoner hired a Chaver to separate Chalah properly. This shows that he cares!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He separates Terumah, and puts it in his own Chaver Kli. When the commoner comes, he takes the olives and the Terumah. We are not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest he touch it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, a kneader puts it in a special Kli, so the commoner will remember not to touch it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Here, there is no reminder!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He puts it in a Kli of dung, stone or earth (which cannot become Tamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why must it be the Chaver's Kli? It could even be the commoner's Kli!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, it means a Kli of a commoner that a Chaver can use.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH <i>NOCHRIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We support Nochrim working in Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Dimi bar Shishna taught that we may not dig with Nochrim (in Shemitah), and we do not say 'Shalom' to them twice!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah does not mean that we help them. We merely wish them that they should prosper.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi bar Shishna):</span> We do not say 'Shalom' to them twice.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Chisda would greet them first. (Maharsha - Derech Eretz obligates one who receives 'Shalom' to return it and double it, and this is forbidden.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Kahana would say 'Shalom to my master', intending to bless his Rebbi with Shalom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may greet them with 'Shalom'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we may wish them prosperity, all the more so we can greet them with 'Shalom'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yevo):</span> The Mishnah permits greeting them on their holiday.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not enter a Nochri's house on his holiday and greet him with 'Shalom'. This is permitted if he meets a Nochri in the market; it must be in a serious tone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav Huna and Rav Chisda were sitting; Geneiva passed by. One suggested that they stand for him, for he is learned. The other said that they should not, since he is quarrelsome.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Geneiva:</span> Shalom to you kings, Shalom to you kings!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna and Rav Chisda:</span> What is the source that Chachamim are called kings?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Geneiva:</span> "In me (the Torah), kings will reign."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna and Rav Chisda:</span> What is the source that we say 'Shalom' twice to a king?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Geneiva:</span> Rav Yehudah learns this from "with you, Ben Yishai, Shalom, Shalom."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna and Rav Chisda:</span> Please taste something.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Geneiva:</span> Rav Yehudah taught that one may not taste anything before giving food to his animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It says "I will give grass in your field for your animals", then it says "you will eat and be satiated."</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A <i>SHALI'ACH</i> TO RECEIVE A <i>GET</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'receive this Get for my wife' or 'take this Get for my wife' (and gave it to him), Reuven can retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven's wife told Levi 'receive my Get for me' (and Reuven gave it to him), Reuven cannot retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, if Reuven told Levi 'I don't want you to receive it for her. Rather, take it and give it to her' (and he gave it to him), he can retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, even if she said 'take my Get for me', Reuven cannot retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Acha brei d'Rav Avya):</span> In the Reisha, Reuven can retract only because his wife did not make Shimon a Shali'ach to receive the Get. Had she done this, Reuven could not retract (even though he said 'take').</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Inference):</span> When a man says 'take', it is as if he says 'acquire (on behalf of).'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, it is not as if he says 'acquire'. He can retract even if his wife made Shimon a Shali'ach to receive;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah needed to teach about when he says 'receive this Get for my wife.' One might have thought that since he cannot appoint a Shali'ach to receive a Get, even when she receives it, it is Pasul;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. When he says 'receive', he means 'receive and take.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven's wife told Levi 'receive my Get for me' (and Reuven gave it to him), Reuven cannot retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This applies to both cases (above), whether Reuven said 'receive' or 'take.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it is only when he said 'receive.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Therefore, if Reuven told Levi 'I don't want you to receive it for her. Rather, take it and give it to her' (and he gave it to him), he can retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Inference):</span> This is only because Reuven said 'I don't want...' If not, he could not retract!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This teaches that saying 'take' is like saying 'receive'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps he said 'Heilach' (here it is, which connotes 'take it like she said').</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Clearly, a man can be a Shali'ach to give a Get. He is in place of the husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Clearly, a woman can be a Shali'ach to receive a Get. She is in place of the wife;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can a man be a Shali'ach to receive a Get, and can a woman be a Shali'ach to give a Get?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven told a Shali'ach 'receive this Get for my wife' or 'take this Get for my wife', he can retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven's wife told a Shali'ach 'receive my Get for me', he cannot retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The same person can be a Shali'ach in both cases. This shows that a Shali'ach to give a Get can receive a Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, they must be different people. (Since only a man can give a Get, only a woman can receive it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> Therefore, if Reuven told the Shali'ach 'I don't want you to receive it for her, rather take it and give it to her' (and he gave it to the Shali'ach), he can retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that one person can be a Shali'ach for either.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>At least we will say that a man can be a Shali'ach for either, since a father can receive his daughter's Get when she is a minor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The question remains, can a woman be a Shali'ach to give a Get?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Mari - Mishnah):</span> Five female relatives of Leah (are suspected to hate her, e.g. her co-wife, her Yevamah... and) are not believed to say that Leah's husband died. They are believed to bring her Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There, the women are Sheluchim to give the Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ashi):</span> We can also learn this from the Reisha.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A woman may bring her own Get. She must say 'it was written and signed in front of me.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The case is, she is a Shali'ach to give her own Get.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A <i>SHALI'ACH</i> WHO CHANGED HIS MISSION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If Leah asked Shimon to bring her Get, and he told Reuven (her husband) that he was asked to receive it, and Reuven said 'Heilach (here you have it; take it) like she said', even when Shimon gives it to Leah, she is not divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Inference):</span> He holds that Reuven relies on what Shimon told him (that he was a Shali'ach to receive. Therefore, Reuven did not make Shimon a Shali'ach to give the Get);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he held that Reuven relies on what Leah said, since she asked Shimon to bring the Get, and Reuven told him to do as she said, he would be a Shali'ach to bring it, and she would be divorced when she gets it.</p>
