<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A <i>GET</i> BROUGHT IN A BOAT (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> All agree that rivers of Eretz Yisrael are like Eretz Yisrael regarding Gitin. The Beraisos argue about the Mediterranean Sea. (Beraisa #1 is like R. Yehudah in the following Beraisa, and Beraisa #2 is like Chachamim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> South of the incline from Turei Amnon (to the sea) is Eretz Yisrael. North of it is Chutz La'aretz;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Islands in the Mediterranean Sea within the line between Turei Amnon and Nachal Mitzrayim (Wadi Kelt) are part of Eretz Yisrael. Those outside this line are Chutz La'aretz;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah says "and the border of the sea" includes islands next to (i.e. west of) Eretz Yisrael. They are like part of Eretz Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If we extend lines westward from Kapluriya and Nachal Mitzrayim (Wadi El Arish) until the Atlantic Ocean, all (islands and parts of islands) between these lines are part of Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim learn from "and the border of the sea"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This includes islands within the line between Turei Amnon and the River of Mitzrayim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah does not require a verse to include those islands.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SURYA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Meir says, Ako is like Eretz Yisrael regarding Gitin...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is selling one's (Kena'ani) slave to Surya like selling to Chutz La'aretz? (If one sells a slave to Chutz la'Aretz, he goes free. This is a fine to punish the master.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Aba - Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Ako is like Eretz Yisrael regarding Gitin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is only for Gitin, but Ako is like Chutz La'aretz regarding slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>All the more so Surya, which is even further away, is like Chutz La'aretz!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Surya is like Eretz Yisrael in three ways, and like Chutz La'aretz in three ways:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Its soil is Tamei like that of Chutz La'aretz. Selling a slave to Surya is like selling to Chutz la'Aretz. Bringing a Get from Surya is like bringing from Chutz la'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Ma'aser and Shemitah apply to its produce, like Eretz Yisrael. One may enter Surya and remain Tahor. Buying a field in Surya is like buying in counties of Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The Tana obligates Ma'aser and Shemitah like Eretz Yisrael. He holds that Kivush Yachid (land conquered by an individual) gets Kedushas Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa says that one may enter Surya and remain Tahor, but the Reisha says that its soil is Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he enters in a box, he remains Tahor:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> One who enters Chutz La'aretz in a box becomes Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, he remains Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Even Rebbi is Metamei only in Chutz La'aretz proper. There, Chachamim decreed Tum'ah on the soil <i>and</i> the air. In Surya, they decreed only on the soil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Buying a field in Surya is like buying in counties of Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the significance of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> One may write the deed of sale on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That cannot be!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Clarification (Rava):</span> One tells a non-Jew to write the deed on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though mid'Rabanan, one may not ask a non-Jew to perform labors on Shabbos, here it was permitted for the sake of settling Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A DOCUMENT OF FREEDOM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a slave brought his Get (document) of freedom, and it says 'yourself and my property are acquired to you', the slave goes free, but does not acquire the property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it says 'all my property is acquired to you', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Along with acquiring himself, he also acquires the other property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Granted, he acquires himself, just like a woman is believed to bring her own Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But he should not acquire the other property, unless he is Mekayem the document, like the normal law of monetary documents!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> Since he does not acquire himself, he does not acquire the other property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Granted, he does not acquire the other property, unless he is Mekayem the document, like the normal law of monetary documents;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But he should acquire himself, just like a woman is believed to bring her own Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> Whether it says 'yourself and my property are acquired to you', or 'all my property is acquired to you', the slave goes free, but does not acquire the property.</p>
