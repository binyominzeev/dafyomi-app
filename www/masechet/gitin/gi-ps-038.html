<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO CAN OWN WHOM?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes, they owned him for his earnings!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> A Nochri can acquire a Nochri for his earnings. It says "also from the children of the settlers who live with you, you may buy slaves" - you (Yisrael) can buy Nochrim, but they cannot buy you, nor can a Nochri buy another Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps a Nochri cannot acquire another Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Indeed, Reish Lakish said that they cannot acquire one another!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He meant that they cannot totally acquire one another. We suggest that perhaps they cannot acquire one another even for earnings.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Nochri can acquire a Yisrael for his earnings (a Yisrael can sell himself to be a slave "l'Eker Mishpachas Ger"), all the more so, one Nochri can acquire another for his earnings!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they acquire one another only through money, but not through conquest.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> (Yisrael were forbidden to fight Amon and Mo'av.) Sichon's conquest of (parts of) Amon and Mo'av allowed Yisrael to take those lands.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This shows that a Nochri can acquire a Nochri (through conquest). What is the source that a Nochri can acquire a Yisrael?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "They took a captive from us."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SLAVES WHO WERE CAPTURED AND REDEEMED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shemen bar Aba, citing R. Yochanan):</span> A slave who escaped from prison goes free. In fact, we force the master to write a document of freedom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> In either case, the redeemed slave works like a slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Wherever R. Shimon ben Gamliel appears in a Mishnah, the Halachah follows him, with only three exceptions: the Mishnayos about an Arev, the divorce in Tzidon, and one who found a proof after he lost a monetary judgment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan contradicts himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Abaye established the Mishnah to be before despair. He can answer that R. Yochanan discusses escaping from prison after the master despaired.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rava established the Mishnah to be after despair. How can he resolve the contradiction?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava explained that R. Shimon's reason is Chizkiyah's enactment (lest slaves present themselves to captors to escape their masters. It does not apply to one who escapes from prison);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who escapes risks his life. He would not willingly get captured!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Shmuel's Shifchah (female slave) was captured. Others redeemed her l'Shem Shifchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The redeemers told Shmuel 'we hold like R. Shimon ben Gamliel. Even if you hold like Chachamim, she remains a slave because we intended for this!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They assumed that Shmuel had not yet despaired. Really, he had already despaired.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Shmuel not use her like a slave. Further, he even ruled that she needs no Get of freedom!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Shmuel taught, that if one declares his slave to be ownerless, the slave goes free and needs no Get of freedom. He learns from "any slave of a man."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the verse exclude the slave of a woman?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it teaches that only a slave who has a master is a slave. If no master has authority over him, he is not a slave.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FREEING SLAVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Aba bar Zutra's Shifchah was captured. A Nochri from Tarmud redeemed her, to take her for a wife. Yisre'elim sent to R. Aba that the proper thing to do is to send to her a Get of freedom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they can buy her back from the Nochri, why must he send a Get?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they cannot her back, how will a Get help?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Nochri was willing to sell her. The community would redeem her only if R. Aba sent a Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Nochri was unwilling to sell her, but if R. Aba sent a Get (the Nochri would know that she used to be a slave, and) she would be disgraced in the Nochri's eyes, and he would agree to sell her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learned that Nochrim desire animals of Yisrael (for Bi'ah) more than their own wives! (All the more so, they desire our slaves!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is in secret. If it becomes known, they are disgraced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Men were sinning with a Shifchah in Pumbadisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> If not for Rav Yehudah's law, that one who frees a slave transgresses a Mitzvas Aseh (positive Mitzvah), I would force the master to free her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> Rav Yehudah admits that one may free a slave to prevent transgressions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Abaye really argue about this?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chinena bar Rav Ketina):</span> A case occurred in which Chachamim forced a master to free his half-Shifchah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">38b----------------------------------------38b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The case was, men were freely sinning with her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Abaye agrees that we may free a slave if that is the only way to stop transgression;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Chinena's case was different. A half Shifchah is forbidden to slaves and to free men. A full Shifchah may be paired with a male slave, and he will stop others from sinning with her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One who frees a slave transgresses an Aseh - "forever you will make them work for you."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A case occurred in which R. Eliezer found only nine men in a Beis ha'Keneses, and he freed his slave to complete the Minyan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yehudah admits that one may free his slave for the need of a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> "Forever they will work for you" is optional;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>R. Akiva says, this is an obligation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (against answer (n)):</span> Perhaps R. Eliezer holds like R. Yishmael, that there is no obligation to work with slaves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> It (making slaves work for you) is an obligation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> People lose their property for three transgressions: freeing their slaves, perusing their possessions on Shabbos, and fixing their meal on Shabbos at the time of the lecture in the Beis Medrash.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> There were two families in Yerushalayim that were uprooted. One fixed meals on Erev Shabbos, the other, on Shabbos day (at the time of the lecture).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ONE WHO MAKES HIS SLAVE <i>HEKDESH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rabah citing Rav):</span> If one declares his slave to be Hekdesh, the slave goes free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The slave's body cannot become Kodesh. The master didn't say he is Mekadesh only his value. The only explanation is, he means that the slave should become part of the holy nation (through freedom).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Yosef citing Rav):</span> If one declares his slave to be Hefker, the slave goes free.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rabah says that he goes free even when he was declared Hekdesh, and all the more so, if he was made Hefker.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Yosef says that he goes free when he was made Hefker, but not if he was declared Hekdesh. Perhaps the master made his value Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the slave need a Get of freedom?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Avin citing Rav):</span> In either case he goes free and requires a Get of freedom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah (against his own teaching) - Beraisa #1):</span> If one makes his property Hekdesh, and it includes slaves, the treasurers of Hekdesh may not free them. Rather, they may sell them to buyers that will free them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi says, the slave can give his own value to buy freedom his, for this is like selling the slave to himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One cannot refute Rav from a Beraisa. Rav is a Tana, and he can argue against a Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #2):</span> "Any Cherem (a form of Hekdesh)... from people" includes Kena'ani slaves (they do not go free)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he explicitly was Makdish their value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't we give this answer to Beraisa #1?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Beraisa #1 said that the treasurers cannot set them free. If he was Makdish only their value, the treasurers have nothing to do with the slaves! (Their claim is only on the master to pay the slaves' value.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Beraisa #1 said that the treasurers can sell them to others, who will set them free. The others cannot free them (if he was Makdish their value, for the treasurers had no authority to sell them)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Seifa of Beraisa #1 - Rebbi):</span> The slave can pay his own value to go free, for this is like selling him to himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was Makdish their value, the treasurers have no authority to sell him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #3):</span> One who makes his slave Hekdesh, the slave works and is fed from the earnings, for only his value was made Hekdesh.</p>
