<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW CAN WIDOWS COLLECT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Judges refrained from administering the oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It was due to the case Rav Kahana recorded.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> Once. a man deposited a gold coin with a widow during a famine year. She put it in the flour. It was baked into a loaf (unknown to her), and she gave the loaf to a poor man. When the depositor asked for his coin, she swore that she did not benefit from it, and that one of her children should die if she is lying. Soon after, one of her children died.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> If someone who swears truthfully is punished like this, all the more so one who swears falsely!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was she punished?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She benefited from the coin. (It saved her flour that otherwise would have been used in the loaf she gave to the poor man.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, she did not swear truthfully!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, she was like one who swore truthfully. (She did not intend to lie.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If this was the reason, they should have stopped divorced women from swearing as well!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> They stopped only widows from swearing. Divorcees still swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A widow toils to care for the orphans. She might rationalize swearing that that she did not receive any money from the Kesuvah, even if she did, since she feels that she is entitled to compensation for her toil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Chachamim of Sura (Rav Yehudah):</span> Rav and Shmuel both say that only in Beis Din she does not swear, but she may swear outside of Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav would not allow a widow to collect her Kesuvah! (According to Rav Yehudah, he should tell her to swear outside of Beis Din.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Chachamim of Neharde'a (Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> Only in Beis Din she does not swear, but she may swear outside of Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Rav):</span> She does not swear even outside of Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is consistent with Rav's practice not to allow a widow to collect her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav allow her to collect through a vow?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In Rav's day, people took vows lightly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>A widow came in front of Rav Huna to collect her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> I hold like Rav, who does not collect a Kesuvah for a widow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The woman:</span> The reason is, you suspect I may have already received part of my Kesuvah. I swear by Hash-m's name that I have not benefited from my Kesuvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Rav admits that if she swears on her own, she receives her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>A widow came in front of Rabah bar Rav Huna to collect her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rabah bar Rav Huna:</span> I hold like Rav and my father, who did not collect a Kesuvah for a widow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The woman:</span> Give me food. (I am entitled to food, since I am not receiving the Kesuvah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rabah bar Rav Huna:</span> I hold like Shmuel, who says that once a woman requests her Kesuvah, she does not receive food.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">The woman:</span> Your chair should be turned over (this was a curse). You ruled against me like two Chachamim whose rulings do not go together!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They reversed the chair of Rabah bar Rav Huna and returned it (hoping that this would fulfil the curse). Nevertheless, he got sick.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah (to R. Yirmeyah Bira'ah):</span> Make the widow vow in Beis Din and swear outside of Beis Din. Publicize that widows collect Kesuvos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> Widows don't swear, but divorcees do.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really true that a divorcee collects only through an oath, but not through a vow?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rabanan in Eretz Yisrael sent a message about a certain woman who received a Get, and vowed not to eat anything that grows if she had already received towards her Kesuvah anything more than a coat, a Sefer Tehilim, a Sefer Iyov, and a worn Sefer Mishlei;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">35b----------------------------------------35b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> We appraised these to be worth five Maneh. You should let her collect the rest of her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Indeed, a divorcee needs an oath. This case was a widow. She had received a Get from a Yavam (to forbid Yibum).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>COLLECTING THROUGH A VOW</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Gamliel enacted that she vow...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> This is only if she did not yet remarry. If she already remarried, she does not vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, this is because her husband will annul the vow. Also before she remarries, we should be concerned lest she vow falsely, expecting that she will marry and her husband will annul her vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A husband cannot annul vows she took before he married her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest she vow falsely, expecting that she will regret her vow in Beis Din, and Beis Din will permit it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Huna holds that one who asks to permit a vow must give the details of the vow. (Beis Din would not permit her when they hear why she vowed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> She collects her Kesuvah through a vow even after she remarried.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, (she is not afraid to vow falsely, for) her husband will annul the vow!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She vows b'Rabim (in front of many people).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Huna - Beraisa):</span> If she remarried, she collects her Kesuvah if she vowed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means, if she vows now.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is if she vowed before she remarried.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If she remarried, she vows and collects her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not a husband can annul a vow made b'Rabim. (This Tana holds that he cannot, therefore she can vow after remarrying to collect her Kesuvah.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PERMISSION OF VOWS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one seeks to permit a vow (through Beis Din), must he tell Beis Din the details of the vow?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> He need not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> He must.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Nachman says that he need not. If he needed to, sometimes he would omit a detail, and the Heter (permission) would be Pasul, since Beis Din permits only what they hear!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Papa says that he must. Perhaps he seeks to permit a vow in order to transgress!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Kohen who marries a woman forbidden to Kohanim is disqualified from Mikdash service until he vows not to benefit from her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Immediately upon vowing, he may serve. After serving, he divorces her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Nachman):</span> If one may permit a vow without detailing it, perhaps he will permit his vow and keep his wife!</p>
