<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CAN A MUTE TESTIFY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> If a Cheresh (deaf person) can communicate by writing, we (fulfill his written request to) write and give a Get to his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> Why must Rav Kahana teach this? We know this from our Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man became unable to speak and others asked him if we should write a Get for his wife and he nodded his head, we test him three times. If he answers properly no and yes, we write and give the Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> The Mishnah discusses a mute. He is not like a (total) Cheresh (who lacks understanding):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who can speak but not hear is a Cheresh. One who can hear but not speak is a mute;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Both of them are like healthy people in every respect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira - Beraisa):</span> "If he will not testify" excludes a mute, for he cannot testify.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why can't he testify by writing?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Testimony must be "Al Pi (oral)", not through their writing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Just like we test him (one who became mute, to see if he is alert enough) to give a Get, we test also regarding sales and gifts, for testimony, and for inheritances.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that he can testify, even though he cannot speak!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef bar Minyomi):</span> The Beraisa refers to Edus Ishah (testimony that a man died to permit his wife to remarry). Chachamim were lenient about Edus Ishah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> We test for inheritances (he testifies about others)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> No, it refers to his Bechor. (Tosfos - he identifies his firstborn son; Rashi - he commands that his Bechor not get an extra portion.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> We test for sales and gifts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He testifies about others' transactions!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it refers to what he sells and gives.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHICH DEAF MEN MAY DIVORCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Kahana - Beraisa):</span> For Metaltelim we rely on gestures and facial expressions of a Cheresh and what he writes, but not for Gitin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not he can divorce:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> This applies only to one who was deaf from birth, but if a hearing man became deaf, he writes (a Get) and witnesses sign it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he was deaf from birth, why can't he divorce? Just like he married through gesturing, he can divorce through gesturing (the whole marriage is only mid'Rabanan)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That reasoning applies to a regular marriage. The Beraisa says that he cannot divorce a woman with whom he did Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> From what kind of marriage did she fall to Yibum?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the deceased husband was also a Cheresh, just like she was (initially) married through gesturing, she can be divorced (even by the Yavam) through gesturing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Her first husband was healthy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Her first husband was also a Cheresh. We decree that the Yavam cannot divorce, lest he divorce when her first husband was healthy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we make such decrees, we should never allow him to divorce, lest he divorce after doing Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People can confuse Yevamos (who fell from different types of husbands), but they would not confuse a woman whom he was Mekadesh with his Yevamah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We do not decree about (one who fell to Yibum from) a Cheresh due to (falling from) a healthy man!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">71b----------------------------------------71b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two brothers were married to two sisters, and both brothers or sisters (or all of them) were Chereshim, and one brother died, his wife is exempt from Chalitzah and Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the wives were unrelated, they may do Yibum. The Yavam can later divorce the Yevamah if he wants to.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> This refutes Answer #2. We must rely on Answer #1.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel argues with Chachamim (the first Tana of his Beraisa. They say that if a healthy man married and became deaf, he cannot divorce even if he can write.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> If she went insane, he may not divorce her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he went deaf or insane, he may never divorce her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say <i>never</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It means, even if he can communicate through writing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> Had R. Yochanan not taught otherwise, one could have said that R. Shimon ben Gamliel explains the first Tana;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to Question m:2):</span> The Mishnah says 'never' to include even if he is very sharp.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> 'Never' alludes to R. Yitzchak's law:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Mid'Oraisa, one may divorce an insane woman, just like one may divorce a sane woman against her will;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim enacted that one may not divorce her, lest men freely have Bi'ah with her. (If he went deaf or insane, he may never divorce her, i.e. even mid'Oraisa.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE COMMAND TO WRITE A <i>GET</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two people asked a man if we should write a Get for his wife and he said 'write it', and they appointed a scribe to write it and witnesses to sign it, even if they gave the Get to him and he gave it to his wife, it is Pasul. He must personally tell the scribe to write and the witnesses to sign.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> The Get is Pasul because he said only 'write.' Had he said 'write and give', it would be valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like R. Meir, who says that Mili may be transferred to another Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Seifa):</span> He must personally tell the scribe to write and the witnesses to sign.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like R. Yosi, who says that Mili may not be transferred to another Shali'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Indeed, the Reisha is like R. Meir and the Seifa is like R. Yosi!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> The entire Mishnah is like R. Meir. The case is, he did not say 'give'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, it should say that it is Pasul because he did not say 'give'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Abaye):</span> Rather, the case is, he did not command three people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, it should say that it is Pasul because he did not command three people!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Abaye):</span> Rather, the entire Mishnah is like R. Yosi. The case is, he did not tell them to appoint a scribe and witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> If so, it should say that it is Pasul because he did not tell them to appoint a scribe and witnesses!</p>
