<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN IS AN <i>AREV</i> OBLIGATED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>All agree that an Arev for a Kesuvah is not obligated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>All agree that a Kablan for a loan is obligated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Opinions differ about an Arev for a loan and a Kablan for a Kesuvah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some say that he is obligated even if the borrower has no property;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Others say that he is obligated only if the borrower has property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Halachah is, in all cases he is obligated, even if the borrower has no property, except for an Arev for a Kesuvah. In that case, even if the husband has property, the Arev is not obligated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he exempt?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The woman does not lose any money, so the Arev does not accept Acharayus (responsibility to pay if her husband will not pay). He thinks that he is merely doing a Mitzvah (to encourage the marriage).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>(On 49b 4:b, Mar Zutra taught that a divorcee collects from her ex-husband from Beinonis.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Chachamim enacted a Kesuvah from Ziburis because a woman wants to marry more than the man does (she will marry in any case).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she collects Ziburis only from orphans, the reason is because she collects from orphans!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Mar Zutra is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>COLLECTING A DEBT FROM ORPHANS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Nachman):</span> If a loan document was brought for payment from orphans, even though it promises that the lender may collect from Idis, he collects only from Ziburis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Abaye):</span> A normal creditor collects from Beinonis, yet he collects Ziburis from orphans.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> That is no proof, for mid'Oraisa, a creditor is only entitled to Ziburis, like Ula taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Mid'Oraisa, a creditor collects Ziburis - "you will stand outside, and the borrower (will give you a security)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Normally, the borrower will give the lowest quality Kli.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim enacted that a creditor collects Beinonis, in order that borrowers will find people to lend to them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Regarding orphans, no enactment was made. The creditor collects from Ziburis like the Torah says.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Culmination of rejection):</span> Here, mid'Oraisa the creditor collects from Idis (due to the Tanai). This is even from orphans!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rava - Avraham Chuza'ah's Beraisa):</span> Only Ziburis may be collected from orphans, even for damages.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Mid'Oraisa, damages are collected from Idis. (This is like Mar Zutra's case!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the damager's Ziburis is like the victim's Idis. The Beraisa is like R. Yishmael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yishmael says that mid'Oraisa, the damager must pay with land as good as the victim's Idis. It was an enactment to make him pay with his own Idis. This enactment was not made against orphans.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rava - R. Eliezer Niyusa'ah's Beraisa):</span> We only collect from Ziburis of orphans, even if they are Idis!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean, 'even if they are Idis'?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is even if the document says that the lender may collect from Idis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - Answer:</span> No. It means, even if the borrower had Idis, but no longer has it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Rava's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one damages Ziburis, if he pays for this with land, he pays Idis. If the Idis is gone, he pays Beinonis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>When orphans must pay, we make no enactment. Mid'Oraisa, they pay Ziburis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - Answer:</span> No. It means, even if orphans damaged a man's property on the river bank (he collects only from Ziburis).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Rava's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One who damages Ziburis, if he pays for this with land, he pays Idis. If he damages the edge of the field by the river, even if the field is Idis, he pays Beinonis. (The river floods it, so one cannot grow crops. It is mere pasture, so one who grazed his animals there is like a borrower, even if the owner did not consent.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>When orphans damage, we make no enactment. Mid'Oraisa, they pay Ziburis. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When we collect land from orphans, we collect Ziburis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Achdevoy bar Ami):</span> Does this refer only to minors, or even to adult orphans?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Ziburis is an enactment to help orphans (it is hard for them to sell property), it was enacted only for minors, but not for adults;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps it is (letter of the law,) because a lender does not expect the borrower to die. People will lend money, even without an enactment to collect from Beinonis of orphans. (This applies equally to minors and adults.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye Kashisha - Beraisa):</span> Chachamim referred even to adult orphans, all the more so to minors.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps that is only regarding the oath imposed on one who collects from orphans, since even adult orphans do not know about their father's affairs, but Ziburis is only from minors!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">50b----------------------------------------50b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>The Halachah is, the enactments of the oath and Ziburis apply to minor and adult orphans.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>COLLECTING FROM PROPERTY GIVEN FOR A GIFT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not collect from Meshubadim if there is Bnei Chorin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Achdevoy bar Ami):</span> Is a gift considered Meshubadim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the enactment was lest buyers lose, if a creditor collects land given for a gift, the receiver did not lose, so no enactment was made;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, do we say that surely the receiver benefited the giver, so if he loses the gift, this is like a loss?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar Kashisha brei d'Rav Chisda - Beraisa):</span> If a Shechiv Mera (one who fears lest he die from his illness) said 'give 200 Zuz to Reuven, 300 to Shimon, and 400 to Levi', precedence of document does not give precedence for collection;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, if a loan document is collected from the estate, it is collected from all of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said 'give 200 Zuz to Reuven, and after him to Shimon, and after him to Levi', precedence of document gives precedence for collection;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Therefore, if a loan document is collected from the estate, it is collected from the last recipient. If he did not receive enough to pay it, the rest is collected from the previous recipient...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Even if the first recipient received Beinonis, and the last received Ziburis, the loan is collected from the Ziburis (for this was the borrower's last Bnei Chorin).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This shows that the enactment was made also regarding recipients of gifts!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> No. The case is, Reuven, Shimon and Levi did not get gifts. They were creditors being paid up!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says 'give'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means 'give the money that I owe.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The creditor with the earliest document should be paid first! (When the Shechiv Mera specified an order, why do we follow his order?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the creditors have no documents.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Beraisa):</span> Precedence of document gives precedence...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refers to whoever is mentioned first in the document detailing the command of the Shechiv Mera.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Really, a creditor takes Beinonis no matter who received it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa discusses taking from the last one , for he always suffers the loss (whenever a recipient or buyer loses land, he is compensated by latter recipients).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #3:</span> The Beraisa discusses when all lands are the same quality. (If they were not, the creditor would receive Beinonis, even if it the last recipient did not have it!)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WE DO NOT COLLECT PEROS FROM <i>MESHUBADIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not collect for Peros (from Meshubadim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula):</span> The obligation to pay for the Peros was never written in a document.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba):</span> It is as if food of a widow and daughters is written (it is a Tanai of every Kesuvah), yet the Mishnah says that they do not collect from Meshubadim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> It was enacted that they are considered written only regarding collecting from Bnei Chorin, but not regarding Meshubadim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Zeira asked the same question of Rav Asi (who holds like Ula), and received the same answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chanina):</span> The obligation to pay for the Peros has no limit.</p>
