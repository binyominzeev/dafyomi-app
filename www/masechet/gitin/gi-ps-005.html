<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO CANNOT MAKE THE DECLARATION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one brought a Get from Chutz La'aretz and cannot say 'it was written and signed in front of me', if it has witnesses, we are Mekayem it through the signatures.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'he cannot say 'it was written and signed in front of me'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Shali'ach is a deaf-mute.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A deaf-mute cannot bring a Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Anyone can bring a Get, except for a deaf-mute, lunatic or minor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> The Shali'ach gave the Get when he was healthy. Before he said 'it was written...' he became deaf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>This is like Rava. Since he cannot make the declaration, we are Mekayem the Get through the signatures.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rabah, even with Kiyum, we should be concerned lest it is not Lishmah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is after people in Chutz La'aretz learned the law of Lishmah (so this is no longer a concern).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even if the Shali'ach can make the declaration, why must he?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We decreed that Sheluchim still say it, lest people in Chutz La'aretz forget the law again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does Kiyum suffice when the Shali'ach was healthy and became deaf?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is an unusual case. Chachamim did not decree in unusual cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is unusual for a wife to be a Shali'ach for her own Get, yet a decree was made!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A woman can bring her own Get, but she must say 'it was written and signed in front of me.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We require her to say it, to make the law of Sheluchim uniform.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, a husband should also need to say it, but we learned that he need not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the husband brings the Get, he need not say 'it was written and signed in front of me,'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The whole reason for the declaration is due to concern lest the husband claim that the Get is Pasul. Since he brought it himself, he will not say that it is Pasul!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>GITIN</i> THAT ARE VALID WITHOUT A DECLARATION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Shmuel):</span> If two Sheluchim bring a Get from abroad, must they make the declaration?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> No. If they would say that they saw the divorce, they would be believed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Rava. The husband cannot claim that the Get is a forgery (i.e. he did not authorize it), since both Sheluchim will contradict him, so there is no concern.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rabah, we should be concerned lest it is not Lishmah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is after people in Chutz La'aretz learned the law of Lishmah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even one Shali'ach should not need to make a declaration!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We decreed that a Shali'ach should make the declaration, lest people in Chutz La'aretz forget the law again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even two Sheluchim should need to say it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is an unusual case. Chachamim did not decree in unusual cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is unusual for a wife to be a Shali'ach for her own Get, and a decree was made!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A woman can bring her own Get, but she must say...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We require her to say it, to make the law of Sheluchim uniform.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, a husband should also need to say it, but we learned that he need not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the husband brings the Get, he need not say 'it was written and signed in front of me,'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The whole reason for the declaration is due to concern lest the husband claim that the Get is Pasul. Since he brought it himself, he will not say that it is Pasul!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man brought a Get from abroad and did not say 'it was written...,' if it was Mekuyam, the Get is valid. If not, it is not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The enactment was made to be lenient on the wife, not stringent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Rava. Once the Get is Mekuyam, there is no other concern.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rabah, we should be concerned lest it is not Lishmah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is after people in Chutz La'aretz learned the law of Lishmah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We said that we decreed that a Shali'ach still say it, lest people in Chutz La'aretz forget the law again!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, she already remarried.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does the Beraisa say that the enactment was made to be lenient on the wife, not stringent? The reason we do not disqualify the Get is because she already remarried!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa dispels the following suggestion:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should be stringent and say that she must leave her husband!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The enactment was made to be lenient on the wife, not stringent;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The enactment was made due to concern lest the husband claim that the Get is Pasul. If he does not contest the Get, should we contest it?! (Tosfos - this is Rejection #2. Rashi - it is the culmination of the rejection.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>RELATED ARGUMENTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>One of R. Yochanan and R. Yehoshua ben Levi holds like Rabah, and the other holds like Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yehoshua ben Levi must hold like Rabah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon bar Aba brought a Get, and asked R. Yehoshua ben Levi whether or not he must make a declaration.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Levi:</span> You need not. Only previous generations, which were not proficient in Lishmah, needed to make a declaration.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> We concluded that Rabah is also concerned lest witnesses not be available for Kiyum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> We concluded that Rabah holds that there is a decree to make the declaration even today, lest people forget the law again!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> There was another Shali'ach with R. Shimon. Out of honor for R. Shimon, the other Shali'ach was not mentioned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In front of how many witnesses must the Get be given?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan or R. Chanina):</span> It must be given in front of two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (the other of R. Yochanan and R. Chanina):</span> It must be given in front of three.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>We can prove that R. Yochanan holds that it may be given in front of two.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ravin bar Rav Chisda brought a Get (from abroad) in front of R. Yochanan. R. Yochanan told him to give it in front of two witnesses and to make the declaration.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The opinion that allows in front of two is concerned for Lishmah. The opinion that requires three is concerned for Kiyum. (The declaration is Mekayem the Get, so a Beis Din is required.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> R. Yehoshua ben Levi is concerned for Lishmah, so R. Yochanan must be concerned for Kiyum, and he allows giving in front of two!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> Rabah agrees to Rava. (All are concerned for Kiyum!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Yochanan and R. Chanina argue about whether or not a Shali'ach can become a witness, and the witness can become a judge:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The opinion that allows in front of two holds that a Shali'ach can become a witness, and the witness can become a judge. (The Shali'ach helps to comprise a Beis Din of three judges.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The opinion that requires three holds that a Shali'ach can become a witness, but a witness cannot become a judge.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We hold that for mid'Rabanan laws, a witness can become a judge!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the opinion that requires three holds that since a woman may be a Shali'ach, we are concerned lest they rely on her to be one of the three judges for the Beis Din;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The other opinion says that people know that a woman cannot be a judge, so we are not concerned for such a mistake.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a Shali'ach brought a Get from abroad and gave it, but did not say 'it was written and signed in front of me', and she remarried, she must leave her husband. If she had children, they are Mamzerim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, the children are not Mamzerim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Shali'ach should take back the Get, give it again in front of two, and make the declaration.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Meir really hold that because the Shali'ach did not say this, she must leave her husband, and her children are Mamzerim?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! This is like another teaching of R. Meir:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> R. Meir holds that if a Get is unlike the rules that Chachamim fixed for Gitin, (if she remarried) she must leave her husband, and her children are Mamzerim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>HOW MUCH OF THE WRITING MUST THE <i>SHALI'ACH</i> SEE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Bar Hedya wanted to bring a Get. He came in front of R. Achai, who was appointed over Gitin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Achai:</span> You must see every letter written (so you will be able to say 'it was written and signed in front of me').</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He came in front of R. Ami and R. Asi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Ami and R. Asi:</span> This is unnecessary. Further, you should not do so, lest people doubt the validity of previous Gitin, for which this was not done.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rabah bar bar Chanah brought a Get; only half of it was written in front of him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Even if (you saw) only the first line written Lishmah, that is enough.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> It suffices to hear the pen scratching on the paper.</p>
