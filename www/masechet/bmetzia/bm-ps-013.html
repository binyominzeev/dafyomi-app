<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CONCERN FOR FRAUDULENT COLLECTION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> We may write a document for the borrower in the lender's absence.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why is this l'Chatchilah? Perhaps he will not lend the money on the date of the document, and he will improperly take land from people who bought before the loan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Asi):</span> The Mishnah discusses Hakna'ah documents, in which the borrower puts a lien on his land immediately (so the collection is proper).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that if it has Achrayus, the finder may not return it. We said that this is when Shimon admits that he owes. We are concerned lest the loan was given after the date on the document, and Reuven will collect improperly from property sold before the loan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is a Hakna'ah document, the collection is proper;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is not a Hakna'ah document, it would be written only in front of the lender. Surely, the loan was the same day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Asi):</span> The Halachah is, a document without Hakna'ah should be written only in front of the lender;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since this document was lost, we are concerned lest it was written (improperly) in the lender's absence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (a) - Abaye):</span> Even if a document is not Hakna'ah, when witnesses sign, the lender immediately acquires (a lien on the borrower's land).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye did not learn like Rav Asi, due to this question. Since documents that are not Hakna'ah are written only in front of the lender, we should not be concerned lest the money was not given on the date!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Abaye - Mishnah):</span> If one finds a Get of divorce or freedom, a document of a gift from a dying man or a receipt, he may not return it, perhaps they were written and never given.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why should this matter? When witnesses sign, the lender acquires immediately!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He acquires only if the document is ultimately given.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that if it has Achrayus, we do not return it. We established this to be when Shimon admits, lest the loan was given after the date (and Reuven will collect illegally).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Asi - above):</span> This refers to documents that are not Hakna'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye says that when witnesses sign, the lender acquires immediately. How can he answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> We are concerned lest the loan was already repaid. The borrower admits because he is scheming to help the lender collect from buyers illegally (and share the profit).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ANOTHER EXPLANATION OF THE MISHNAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel is not concerned for repayment and scheming. How can he answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If he learns like Rav Asi, he can answer like Rav Asi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, if he learns like Abaye, how he can answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Mishnah discusses when Shimon does not admit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, when there is no Achrayus, why do we return the document?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, Reuven cannot collect from land that Shimon sold, but he can collect from Bnei Chorin (property that Shimon owns)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel says (like he said elsewhere) that according to R. Meir, a document without Achrayus cannot be used to collect at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it cannot be used for collection, why return it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nasan bar Oshiya):</span> The lender can use the parchment to cork a bottle.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we return it to the borrower?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The borrower claims that the lender forged the document.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE ARGUMENT IN THE MISHNAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The argument in the Mishnah is when Shimon does not admit. R. Meir says that a document without Achrayus cannot be used to collect at all. Chachamim hold that in can be used to collect from Bnei Chorin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When Shimon admits, all agree that we return it. We are not concerned for repayment and scheming.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> They argue about when Shimon admits. R. Meir agrees that a document without Achrayus can be used to collect from Bnei Chorin. Chachamim hold that it can be used to collect even from Meshubadim (property that the borrower sold).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When Shimon does not admit, all agree that we do not return it. We are concerned for repayment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A Beraisa supports R. Yochanan, refutes R. Elazar in one point, and refutes Shmuel in two points.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If Levi found a document with Achrayus, even though the lender and borrower agree, he may not return it to either;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the document has no Achrayus, if the borrower agrees, Levi returns it to the lender. If not, he may not return it to either.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is because documents with Achrayus can be used to collect even Meshubadim. Documents without Achrayus can be used to collect from Bnei Chorin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, either can be used to collect even Meshubadim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>This refutes R. Elazar, who said that R. Meir says that a document without Achrayus cannot be used to collect at all;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Also, R. Elazar said that neither Tana is concerned for scheming, but the Beraisa is concerned (it says not to return a document with Achrayus even when both admit)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Elazar is refuted on two points! (Above, we said that he is refuted on only one)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both points stem from one source;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Because he says that they argue only when Shimon does not admit, he was forced to say that neither is concerned for scheming.</p>
