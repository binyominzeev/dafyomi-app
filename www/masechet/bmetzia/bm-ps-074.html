<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SITUMTA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If three people gave money to Reuven, and each asked him to buy the same thing, and he bought it, they are partners in it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if they gave him loose money. If the money was bound, he bought for the one whose money he used.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Situmta (marking barrels that one wants to buy) is an acquisition.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chaviva):</span> It is a full acquisition.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabanan):</span> If either side retracts, he must receive the curse (He who punished...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The Halachah follows Rabanan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In a place where this is used to acquire, it acquires.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CONTRACTING FOR UNFINISHED GOODS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven harvested...(before there was a fixed price).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If two labors still must be done to the Peros, he may contract, but not if three remain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If one can do the remaining labors himself, even if 100 remain, he may contract. If something remains to be done at the hands of Heaven, he may not contract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Mishnah):</span> He may contract if he has a stack of grain.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He must put it in the sun, thresh and winnow!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (for Rav):</span> The case is, it already dried in the sun.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is still difficult for Shmuel. Winnowing requires wind!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (for Shmuel):</span> He can use a sifter in place of winnowing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Mishnah):</span> He may contract if he has a container of grapes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They must be warmed (through the sun, or from the ground), brought to the winery, stomped, and the wine must be drawn into the pit!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (for Shmuel):</span> R. Chiya taught (below) that the olives were already warm. Similarly, we can say that the grapes are already warm.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is still difficult for Rav, for three labors remain!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (for Rav):</span> The Mishnah discusses a place where the buyer draws the wine into the pit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question #3 (Mishnah):</span> He may contract if he has a container of olives.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They must be warmed, brought to the olive-press, pressed, and the oil must be drawn into the pit!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (for Shmuel - R. Chiya):</span> The case is, the olives were already warm.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is still difficult for Rav, for three labors remain!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (for Rav):</span> The Mishnah discusses a place where the buyer draws the oil into the pit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question #3 (Mishnah):</span> He may contract if he has clay formed to make pots.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It must be wrapped, dried, brought to the furnace, baked and taken out!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (for Shmuel):</span> The case is, it is already wrapped and dried.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is still difficult for Rav, for three labors remain!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (for Rav):</span> The Mishnah discusses a place where the buyer takes the pots out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question #4 (Mishnah):</span> He may contract if he has wood and stones that were put in the furnace to make plaster.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They must be burned and taken out, water must be added and it must be mixed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (for Rav):</span> The Mishnah discusses a place where the buyer mixes it with water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Shmuel, why does the Mishnah say that they were already put in the furnace? Even if they were not, he may contract, since this is not b'Yedei Shamayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah means 'once they are <i>ready</i> to put in the furnace.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CONTRACTING FOR THE FUTURE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Clay formed to make pots.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> One may not contract until the clay is formed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi says, that is only for white clay. One may contract for pots of black clay, for others have them already formed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Ameimar would give money once the potter brought (black) clay into his house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to whom is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Meir, the clay must be formed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to R. Yosi, even if the potter has no clay, he may contract, since others have!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like R. Yosi. In Ameimar's area, clay was expensive. The buyer and seller decide absolutely on the deal only if the potter has the clay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may contract for manure all year round. (R. Yosi permits only if he has a pile; Chachamim permit it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do the first Tana and Chachamim argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The first Tana permits even in winter. Chachamim permit only in summer.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A CHANGE IN PRICE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He may contract at the cheap price.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Reuven gave money (for ornaments) to a maker of girls' ornaments, on behalf of his father-in-law. Ornaments became cheaper.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> If you stipulated to receive the cheap price, you get at today's price. If not, you get at the price when the money was given.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabanan):</span> If he did not stipulate, why does he get the old price? He only gave money. That is not an acquisition (he can retract and buy now)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> I ruled about who must receive the curse 'He who punished...':</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven stipulated and the seller wants to retract, the seller bears the curse. If he did not stipulate and the buyer wants to retract, he bears the curse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> What is the source that our Mishnah is Chachamim who argue about R. Shimon, and say that money does not acquire, and even so, if he stipulated, he gets at today's price?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps our Mishnah is R. Shimon, who says that money acquires. If he stipulated, he gets at today's price. If not, he gets at the original price!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim would say that either way he gets today's price, for a buyer always intends for the cheaper price!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> R. Shimon said only that the buyer cannot retract if the price is the same. If it changed, also he may retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> We must say this. If not, we do not find that a buyer ever bears the curse 'He who punished...' according to R. Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he holds that a buyer never bears the curse!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> In any case, that is the law. However, Chachamim said, 'He who punished...'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does 'in any case' teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is whether the buyer or seller retracts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>We conclude that R. Shimon said that the buyer cannot retract only if the price is the same.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> Here, the curse does not apply to the buyer, for Reuven was only a Shali'ach! (He does not retract. His father-in-law cannot be cursed, for he did not appoint a Shali'ach to make a bad deal, i.e. without stipulating!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> He was not a Shali'ach. He received money from his father to buy clothing. (Alternatively, he was buying in order to sell to his father-in-law.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>LENDING GRAIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may lend to his sharecropper a Se'ah of wheat (on condition to return a Se'ah) for planting, but not to eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Gamliel used to lend this way (for planting); whether the price went up or down, he would take back wheat according to the lower price - this was not the law, he was stringent on himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> A man may lend his sharecropper wheat for (an equal measure of) wheat for planting;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if the sharecropper did not yet start working. If he started, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Tana of the Beraisa distinguish between whether he started working or not, but our Tana (of the Mishnah) does not distinguish?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> In the area of our Tana, the sharecropper provides the seed. Since he has no seed, even if he started working, the owner can fire him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, when the owner lends him to seed, it is like hiring him now. He is hired for a smaller wage (i.e. the owner will deduct the amount he gave him from the sharecropper's share of the harvest).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>In the area of the Tana of the Beraisa, the owner provides the seed. Since it was a good field, the sharecropper agreed to provide the seed himself. Before he started working, the owner can fire him. Therefore, when the owner lends him seed, it is like hiring him now, for a smaller wage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Tana forbids this if he started working and then accepted to provide the seed himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since the owner cannot fire him, he lends to him on condition to get back the same amount. This is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Reuven may ask Shimon to lend to him a Kor of wheat if he fixes a price. If the price declines, he pays wheat. If it goes up, he pays their initial value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> They fixed a price. He should pay what they fixed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> The Seifa gives the law (he pays wheat or the initial value) if they did not fix a price.</p>
