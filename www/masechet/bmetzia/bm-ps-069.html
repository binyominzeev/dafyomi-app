<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE INVESTOR MUST PAY SOMETHING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah, R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah and R. Shimon ben Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A document was presented against Rav Ilish's sons saying that their father had received an Iska (business venture) on condition to receive half the profit or loss.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Rav Ilish was a great man. He knows that the investor must accept more of the loss than the gain!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the investor gets half the profit, he must bear two thirds of the loss;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the investor bears half the loss, he only gets a third of the profit. (The investor's share of the loss is a deposit, and the rest is a loan to the receiver. The receiver gets an extra sixth of the profits; this is his wages for his toil on the investor's portion.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Zevid):</span> Perhaps Rav Ilish ate some of the investor's food!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah (who says that this suffices).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> Rav Nachman did not say that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah, R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah and R. Shimon ben Gamliel, rather that they all hold similarly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> There would be no need to rule like all of them. It would suffice to rule like R. Yehudah, who is the most lenient of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One who gives an animal to raise may stipulate that (they will share the profits equally up to a third), and the receiver will get all the profits above a third.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> This is forbidden, lest the profit will not exceed a third (and the receiver's toil on the investor's half is Ribis for the half that is a loan)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, the investor must guarantee the receiver wages of a Dinar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Rav really hold that he need not guarantee a Dinar?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rav):</span> If Reuven received an animal to fatten it, he keeps the head (and half the increased value).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The case is, Reuven gets all the profits above a third (and still, he must get the head)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, he gets all the profits above a third, or the head (if the profit does not exceed a third).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rav permits getting (only) all the profits above a third when the receiver has an animal of his own. Since he must feed his own, the toil of feeding another animal is minute.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>R. Elazar of Hegronya bought an animal and gave it to his sharecropper to fatten it. He gave him the head and half the profit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">The sharecropper's wife (to her husband):</span> Had you been a partner in the animal, you would have received the entire tail as well!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>The next time, they bought the animal together; R. Elazar gave him half the tail, and said 'let us divide the head.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">The sharecropper:</span> Do I get less than when you owned the entire animal?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> Before, it was my animal. If I didn't give you extra, it would look like Ribis. Now we are partners, so there is no concern!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> You think that you should get more, because you worked harder!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Normally, sharecroppers ensure that the landowner will not need to buy fodder. (It is accepted practice that the sharecropper should work harder.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ENDING A PARTNERSHIP</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - Sumchus):</span> If Reuven accepted a donkey (its value was estimated) to raise, he must care for it for 18 months. He must care for a small animal (i.e. that does not work) for 24 months;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven wants to share the profits before these times, the giver can stop him. However, the toil of the first year is unlike the toil of the second.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean (however...)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, this is <i>because</i> the toil of the first year is less than the toil of the second.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> If Reuven accepted an animal (whose value was estimated) to raise, he must care for the offspring for 30 days if it is a small animal, and for 50 days if it is a big animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi says, he must care for offspring of a small animal for three months, because they need more care.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do they need more care?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is because their teeth are small.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>After this, Reuven gets his half and half of the giver's half.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rav Menashiya bar Gada took his half and half of the giver's half.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Who estimated the value for you? Also, here, the custom is to raise the offspring!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Where the custom is to raise them, he must raise them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Two Kusim made an Iska together. One divided the money by himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> The division stands. Rav Nachman said that money is as if it was already divided. It does not need an evaluation</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The next year the Kusim bought wine together. The other one divided the wine by himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> Who authorized you to divide?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">The Kusi:</span> Why do you always favor my partner?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> Different wines are of different qualities (you cannot divide by yourself). Your partner did not take good coins and leave bad coins for you!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">69b----------------------------------------69b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Coins are considered to be divided.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>This is only if they are all good or all poor, but not if there are good and bad.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FOR WHAT MAY ONE TAKE MONEY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rav Chama used to rent a Zuz for an eighth of a Zuz per day (and accept any loss due to Ones). He lost all his money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He reasoned that one may rent them, just like one may rent a shovel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A shovel is different, for one returns the same shovel itself, and it depreciates. One does not return the same coins, and they do not readily depreciate.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Reuven may tell Shimon 'take four Zuz and lend money to Levi.' The Torah forbids only Ribis paid from the borrower to the lender.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Reuven may tell Shimon 'take four Zuz, and ask Levi to lend money to me.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The money is wages for Shimon to speak on his behalf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Aba Mar, Rav Papa's son, used to take small cakes of wax from wax salesmen and tell his father to lend to them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rabanan (to Rav Papa):</span> Your son is taking Ribis!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> The Torah forbids only Ribis paid from the borrower to the lender. My son takes wages for speaking on their behalf.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>RENTAL WITH LIABILITY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may estimate and give (to share the profits) a cow, donkey or anything that works and eats.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>In a place where they normally divide the offspring immediately, they do so. In a place where they raise them, they raise them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, one may estimate a calf or foal with its mother, and he may increase (rental of) his field without concern for Ribis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Increasing rental: if Reuven rented Shimon's field for 10 Korim of wheat per year, he may ask to borrow money to improve the field, and he will then pay 12 Korim per year;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Regarding a store or ship, this is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Sometimes one may increase their rental:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one decorates a store, this attracts customers, so it is worth more;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one puts a mast or sail on a ship, it is worth more.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One may rent a ship on condition that the renter must pay if it breaks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana and Rav Asi):</span> If he rents it, he is exempt for breakage. If he is liable for breakage, he is a borrower, and he does not pay rent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav was silent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes:</span> Rav should have defended himself from a Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Even though we may not accept from a Yisrael a 'Tzon Barzel' Iska (the receiver accepts any loss, and any profits are shared), we may accept from Nochrim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, one may accept from a Yisrael a cow estimated at 30 Dinarim on condition to give a Sela rental per month, because he did not estimate it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> He did estimate it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> The estimation applies only if it will die. (If it merely decreases in value, he is exempt.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The Halachah is, one may rent a ship on condition to pay if it breaks;</p>
