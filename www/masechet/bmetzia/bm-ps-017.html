<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN IS ONE BELIEVED TO SAY THAT HE PAID?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef bar Minyomi citing Rav Nachman):</span> If Beis Din told Reuven 'go give to Shimon', and later Reuven claims that he paid him, he is believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon requests an Adrachta, we do not give to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Beis Din told Reuven 'you are obligated to give Shimon', and Reuven later claims that he paid him, he is not believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon requests an Adrachta, we write one for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Zvid citing Rav Nachman):</span> Whether Beis Din said 'go give' or 'you are obligated to give', Reuven is believed to say that he paid, and we do not write an Adrachta for Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The two expressions differ about the following. If they said 'go give', and Reuven claims that he paid, and witnesses say that they once saw him refuse to pay, he is established to be a liar on that debt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they said 'you are obligated to give', and Reuven claims that he paid, and witnesses say that he once refused to pay, he is not established to be a liar on that debt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When they said 'you are obligated to give', Reuven was merely stalling. He thinks that Beis Din might change their minds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Levi claimed 100 from Yehudah. He denied it all, and witnesses testified that he has it. Yehudah then said that he paid. He is established to be a liar on this money; he is not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shabtai wrote in his daughter-in-law's Kesuvah that he would give to her a silk garment. She lost her Kesuvah. He denied the matter. Witnesses testified that he had written it; he said that he gave it to her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> He is established to be a liar about that garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin):</span> Reuven was obligated to swear to Shimon. He claims that he swore, and witnesses testified that he refused to swear. He is established to be a liar about that oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Presumably, that is only when Beis Din obligated him to swear. If he accepted on himself to swear, he is believed. People often <i>say</i> (about self-imposed obligations, not according to Beis Din) 'I will not fulfill it' (even if they intend to fulfill it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Avin heard this, and said that indeed, this was his intent.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE MAY NOT REUSE A DOCUMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Asi citing R. Yochanan):</span> If one finds in the market a validated document for a loan given that same day, he returns it to the lender.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We are not concerned lest the loan was never given, for it was validated;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We are not concerned lest it was paid, for people do not pay loans on the same day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> You said in the name of R. Yochanan that if a loan was paid, the document cannot be used for another loan (of the same amount between the same parties), because the lien (that the document imposes against the borrower) has been pardoned!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what case does R. Yochanan teach that the document may not be used again?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it is on a later day, why does he forbid (only) because the lien was pardoned? It may not be used because the date precedes the loan!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Predated loan documents are invalid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, R. Yochanan teaches that the document may not be used the same day. This shows that people sometimes pay a loan the same day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Asi):</span> It is possible to pay a loan on the same day. However, this is rare, so (if we do not know that this occurred), we are not concerned for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Kahana):</span> R. Yochanan says that we return a document on the same day if the borrower admits that he did not pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, of course it may be returned!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that perhaps it was paid, and he claims that it was not, in order to use it again to borrow money, and save the cost of another document;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan teaches that we are not concerned for this. The lender would not do so, lest Chachamim find out, and disqualify it (for collection from Meshubadim (Rashi), or even from Bnei Chorin (Rashbam)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is R. Yochanan's law different than the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one finds loan documents, if they have Achrayus, he may not return them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We established this to be when the borrower admits. We are concerned lest the loan was given after the date on the document, and the document will be used to collect from buyers illegally!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We do not say that the lender fears to use such a document, and demands a new document with the proper date!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, the lender stands to gain from the early date. It enables him to collect from buyers who bought before the loan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, since only the borrower gains (he saves the cost of another document), the lender demands a proper document.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TANAYIM OF BEIS DIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba citing R. Yochanan):</span> If one claims that he paid an obligation that Chachamim enacted, he is not believed.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">17b----------------------------------------17b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding such enactments, we consider it as if a document was written.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> A Mishnah teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman showed her Get and she did not have a Kesuvah (document), she collects her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> You understood the Mishnah due to my teaching!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Perhaps the Mishnah discusses a place where they do not write Kesuvos, so the Get is in place of the Kesuvah, but where they write Kesuvos, she does not collect without a Kesuvah (for one is believed to say that he paid an obligation that Chachamim enacted)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Abaye):</span> What I said is wrong. If where they write Kesuvos she does not collect without a Kesuvah, a widow from Kidushin would collect only with witnesses of death. His heirs could claim that she was already paid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps that is indeed true!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, it was futile to enact a Kesuvah for widows from Kidushin!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A KESUVAH FROM KIDUSHIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Kashisha brei d'Rav Chisda):</span> How does Abaye know that a widow from Kidushin receives a Kesuvah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (Mishnah):</span> If a woman was widowed or divorced, whether from Kidushin or Nisu'in, she collects everything (her full Kesuvah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps that is only when he wrote her a Kesuvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, this is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches unlike R. Eliezer ben Azaryah, who says that an addition (over the minimal Kesuvah) was written only on condition that he will make Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> It says, 'she collects everything.' We understand this only if he wrote for her (extra);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he did not write (extra), she gets 100 or 200 (if she was a widow or virgin when she married him). Why does it say 'everything'?!</p>
