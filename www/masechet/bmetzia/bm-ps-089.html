<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT WE LEARN FROM THE WORD <i>B'DISHO</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question 3:a (88b), and Answer #4 to Question 2:b - Ravina):</span> We do not need an extra verse for man to eat detached, nor for animals to eat attached!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Lo Sachsom Shor b'Disho" includes all animals. We learn a Gezeirah Shavah "Shor-Shor" from Shabbos (all our animals must rest).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Torah could have written 'do not thresh with (something) muzzled.' "Shor" is extra, to equate the muzzler (man) to the muzzled one (an animal);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Just like the muzzler eats attached, also the muzzled one. Just like the muzzled one eats detached, also the muzzler!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> (The Torah permits an animal to eat "b'Disho" (while threshing), and we learn to people.) Threshing applies to something that grows from the ground, and a worker may eat. He may eat everything that grows from the ground:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who milks, churns (milk to make butter), or makes cheese does not eat, for milk does not grow from the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the Torah write "b'Disho"? We already know from "b'Cherem Re'echa"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the extra "Kamah" (which includes everything that grows from the ground) includes even things that do not grow from the ground. "B'Disho" teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> Just like "b'Disho (threshing)" is final processing, and a worker may eat, he may eat whenever he does final processing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who weeds among garlic and onions may not eat, for this is not final processing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the Torah write "b'Disho"? We already know from "v'El Kelyecha Lo Siten"! (Since he does not put in the owner's Kli, he may not eat.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he removes small onions and garlic that will never grow big (he puts them in the owner's Kli).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #3):</span> "B'Disho (threshing)" is before final processing that is Kove'a for Ma'aser, and a worker may eat. He always eats before final processing for Ma'aser;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who separates dates and figs that stuck together may not eat, for they are Kevu'im for Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> One who separates dates and figs that stuck together may eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> That refers to bad dates and figs that do not ripen on the tree. They are warmed in a Kli to ripen (they are not Kavu'a for Ma'aser).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #4):</span> "B'Disho" is before it is Kavu'a for Chalah, and a worker may eat. He always eats food before it is Kavu'a for Chalah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who kneads or arranges the dough may not eat, for a dough is Kavu'a for Chalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must we teach this? Since it is Kavu'a for Ma'aser, we already know that he may not eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Beraisa teaches about Chutz la'Aretz, where there is no Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Nor is there Chalah in Chutz la'Aretz!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Beraisa teaches the law during the seven years of conquest and seven years of division of Eretz Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>During those years Chalah applied, but Ma'aser did not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Permission for a worker to eat does not depend on whether or not the Peros actually must be tithed, rather, whether the final processing has been done. (The final processing for each species is the same as what is Kove'a (Peros of that species that must be tithed) for Ma'aser.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ravina):</span> Beraisos #3 and #4 are extracts from one Beraisa. It says 'threshing is before it is Kavu'a for Ma'aser and (if it applies) Chalah, and a worker may eat. He always eats until produce is Kavu'a for Ma'aser and (if it applies, also) Chalah (even if it is Kavu'a for Ma'aser).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IMPROVING THE FOOD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May a worker roast Peros (Rashi - to make it tastier; Tosfos - if it is unfitting to eat without roasting) and eat it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is this like eating grapes with something to season them (which is forbidden (Tosfos - if it is hard to eat them by themselves)), or not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> An employer may give his workers wine in order that they will not eat many grapes. Workers may dip their bread in brine, in order that they will eat many grapes.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">89b----------------------------------------89b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We knew that one may make himself capable of eating much. The question is only whether he may improve the food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> Workers may eat grapes at the ends of the rows of the vineyard, but they may not roast them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps it is only forbidden because it detracts from his work, but if his wife or children roast them, he may eat them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa):</span> A worker may not roast (produce), put in the ground (to warm it) or break it on a rock and eat, but he may break it in his hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Those are forbidden because they detract from his work.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> That is the only reason to forbid breaking it on a rock. It does not improve it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It improves it a little.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Beraisa):</span> Workers harvesting figs, dates, grapes or olives may eat without tithing, for the Torah permitted them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They may not eat with their bread unless the employer permitted them, nor may they dip them in salt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Dipping in salt is surely like eating them with something else. This does not prove that one may not roast them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IS SALTING <i>KOVE'A</i> FOR <i>MA'ASER</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> A worker hired to dig under olive trees and cover the roots may not eat. If he was hired to harvest, he may eat without tithing, for the Torah permitted him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he stipulated with the employer (R. Chananel - to eat a certain number), he may eat one at a time, but he may not (gather and) eat two at a time. (The Tenai is like a sale. If he would gather two together, he would have to tithe them (Rashba - and he has no permission to tithe).)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He may dip them in salt and eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In which case is it permitted to dip in salt?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> If it is in the Seifa, since he stipulated, he may eat (one at a time) any way he wants!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ra'avad):</span> If it is in the Seifa because he stipulated, may he eat any way he wants without concern for Ma'aser?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is when he did not stipulate.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Dipping in salt is Kove'a for Ma'aser in Eretz Yisrael, but not in Chutz la'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If it is Kove'a for Ma'aser in Eretz Yisrael, it also is Kove'a in Chutz la'Aretz (in those places where Chachamim enacted Ma'aser)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Both in Eretz Yisrael and Chutz la'Aretz, salting one at a time (and eating it) is not Kove'a for Ma'aser, but salting two (together) is Kove'a for Ma'aser;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he stipulated, whether or not he salts, he may eat one at a time, but he may not gather two together;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he did not stipulate, if he does not salt, he may eat two (or any number) at a time;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he salts, he may eat one at a time, but not two at a time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>(Ra'avad - Abaye and Rava agree that even when dipping in salt is forbidden, this is only due to Ma'aser, but not because it helps him eat more. All the more so, roasting is permitted! Most Rishonim hold that the question about roasting is not resolved.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that salting two at a time is Kove'a for Ma'aser?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Masnah):</span> "Ki Kibetzam ke'Amir Gorenah."</p>
