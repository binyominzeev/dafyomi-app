<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DOES <i>HEILACH</i> EXEMPT FROM SWEARING?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Sheshes, who exempts Heilach, why do we need a verse to exempt land from oaths? Every admission of land is Heilach!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We need the verse for when he damaged the land (and must pay. This is not Heilach.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We need the verse for an admission of Kelim (in a case that is not Heilach) and denial of land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> The four Shomrim, i.e. one who guards something for free, or for pay, a borrower, and a renter, swear only when they partially deny and partially admit to the claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He said 'Heilach (here is what you deposited with me).'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Reuven said 'I deposited three cows by you, and all died through your negligence.' Shimon said 'you deposited only two. One died through Ones (beyond my control) and the other died through negligence. I owe you for the latter.' This is not Heilach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Question (against R. Chiya's first law (Daf 3a, 2:a) - R. Aftoriki's father - Beraisa #1) Suggestion: If Reuven told Shimon 'you owe me 100', and Shimon denied the entire claim, and witnesses testified that he owes 50, perhaps he must swear about the rest!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rejection "That he will say 'this is it'" - one swears due to his own admission, but not due to witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Chiya is a Tana. He argues with Beraisa #1. (According to our text (on 3a), R. Chiya cited a Beraisa. Perhaps our Gemara means that he cited a Tana, who can argue with Beraisa #1.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A verse supports Beraisa #1!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse teaches that he swears only when he partially admits to the claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tana #1 (of Beraisa #1) learns both laws, for it says "this" and "is it".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya learns the following two laws:</span> (1) one swears only for partial admission; (2) the admission must be of the same Min (type) as the claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Tana #1 holds like R. Gamliel, that the admission need not be of the same Min as the claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven claimed wheat from Shimon and Shimon admitted that he owed to him barley, Shimon is (totally) exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Gamliel says, he must swear.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MAY SHEPHERDS SWEAR?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Reuven was a shepherd. Every day people used to deposit animals with him, with witnesses. One day they gave to him without witnesses. He denied receiving the animals. Witnesses testified that he ate two of the animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> If we hold like R. Chiya's first law, Reuven must swear about the rest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> He is a thief, so we do not let him swear!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> I meant, (because he cannot swear,) those who claim from him swear and receive.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if we do not hold like R. Chiya's first law, he should be obligated to swear due to Rav Nachman's law!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Levi claimed 100 from Shimon and Shimon denied it, he need not swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> We make him swear Heses (an oath that is Mesis (entices) him to admit. This was enacted after the Mishnah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shevu'as Heses is a Rabbinic enactment. We do not apply an enactment (that if the defendant cannot swear, the claimant swears and collects) to an enactment.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Abaye say that he cannot swear because he is a thief? No shepherd may swear!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A Stam shepherd (we do not know about him) is disqualified (from testimony and swearing).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to shepherds who tend their own animals (they graze them in others' fields). One who tends others' animals is not suspected.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> If not, we could not give animals to shepherds to guard, due to "do not put a stumbling block in front of a blind person (cause someone to transgress)"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, they are not suspected. There is a Chazakah (established nature of people) that one does not sin solely for someone else's benefit.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE TEXT OF THE OATH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven swears that he does not own less than half...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should swear about what he owns, not about what he does not own!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> He swears that he owns part of it, and that he does not own less than half.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should swear that he owns all of it (like he claimed)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it would seem improper that Beis Din gives to him only half.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should swear that he owns half!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That would seem like a retraction of his claim that he owns it all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The text of the oath of the Mishnah is also like a retraction!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The actual text is 'it is all mine. Since you do not believe me about this, I swear that I own part, and I do not own less than half.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since each is holding (and is Muchzak in) half, why do they swear?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> The oath of our Mishnah is a Rabbinic enactment, do deter people from grabbing others' property and claiming it. (Another answer is given on 6a.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>PEOPLE SUSPECTED OF STEALING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since he is suspect that he is trying to steal, we should be concerned lest he swear falsely!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not suspect one to swear falsely just because we suspect that he tries to steal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> If we would suspect that such one may swear falsely, one who partially denies a claim should not swear!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There we do not suspect that he tries to steal. He merely wants to stall until he can pay, like Rabah taught (4a).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (of Rejection):</span> Rav Idi bar Avin taught that one who denies a loan is not disqualified from testifying. (We assume that he merely wants to stall.) One who denies a deposit is disqualified from testifying (surely he intends to steal it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama's Beraisa):</span> The four Shomrim, i.e. one who guards for free or for pay, a borrower and a renter, swear only when they partially deny and partially admit to the claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why don't we say that since (he denies a deposit and) he is suspected to steal, he is suspected to swear falsely!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There he is not suspected of stealing. He merely wants to stall until he finds the thief (if it was stolen) or finds the animal (if it was lost).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why is one who denies a deposit disqualified from testifying? Perhaps he is just stalling!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is disqualified only when witnesses testify that when he denied it he knew that it was in his house, or he was holding it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Huna taught that if a Shomer (one guarding a deposit) says that the deposit was stolen and he wants to pay, he must swear that it is not in his premises (we suspect that he wants to pay for it and keep it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since we suspect him of stealing, we should be concerned lest he swear falsely!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He does not consider this to be theft. He justifies himself, for he will pay for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> He transgressed "do not covet" (this should disqualify him from swearing)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> People think that that is only when one tries to take the object without paying.</p>
