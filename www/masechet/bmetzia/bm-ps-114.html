<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA METZIA 112-116 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to Rav Weiner -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FOR WHOM ARE WE <i>MESADER</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are we Mesader for a borrower?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we learn a Gezeirah Shavah "Michah-Michah" from Erchin, or not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We may learn from Ravin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> My Rebbi'im did not answer this question, but they discusses one who obligated himself to give 100 Zuz to Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (R. Yakov):</span> We learn a Kal va'Chomer from a creditor. Even though a creditor must return a security, he need not be Mesader. Hekdesh need not return a security, all the more so it need not be Mesader!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> "Neder b'Erkecha" equates vows and Erchin;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like we Mesader for Erchin, also for vows.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yakov explains that Torah equates them for one who vows to give the value of a limb. (If one vows to give the Erech of a limb vital to life, he gives the full Erech of the person. Likewise, if one vows to give the value of a limb vital to life, he gives the person's full (slave) value.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that a creditor is Mesader!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Erchin, there is no law of returning a security, yet we are Mesader. A creditor must return a security, all the more so he must be Mesader!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Im Mach Hu me'Erkecha" - we Mesader for Erchin, not for a borrower.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that a creditor is Mesader (Rashi - the first Tana of our Mishnah, he obligates the creditor to forever return the security; Tosfos - the Tana of the Beraisa (113b) who said so explicitly), "Hu" teaches that he was poor from the time he vowed until now (only then he pays (a smaller) Erchin according to what he can afford).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that Hekdesh must return a security!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A creditor is not Mesader, yet he must return a security. Hekdesh is Mesader, all the more so it must return a security!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> "V'Shochav b'Salmaso u'Veracheka" - Hekdesh need not return a security, since it does not need to be blessed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Indeed, Hash-m desires our Berachos - "v'Ochalta v'Sovata u'Verachta"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> "U'Lecha Tihyeh Tzedakah" - Hekdesh need not return a security, since it does not need to fulfill the Mitzvah of Tzedakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar Avuha):</span> Are we Mesader for a borrower?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Eliyahu):</span> Yes. We learn a Gezeirah Shavah "Michah-Michah" from Erchin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says regarding Erchin "v'Im Mach Hu me'Erkecha", and it says regarding a borrower "v'Chi Yamuch Achicha".</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OTHER ANSWERS OF ELIYAHU</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar Avuha):</span> What is the source that a naked person may not separate Terumah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Eliyahu):</span> (One must bless before separating, and one may not bless while naked due to) "v'Lo Yireh Vecha Ervas Davar."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar Avuha):</span> Aren't you a Kohen (Pinchas)? Why are you in a cemetery (of Nochrim)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Eliyahu - Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> A Nochri's grave does not have Tum'as Ohel (to make Tamei whatever is above it or under a common roof with it), for it says about Tum'as Ohel "Adam Ki Yamus b'Ohel");</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Adam Atem" - Yisrael are called 'Adam', but Nochrim are not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Eliyahu was surprised that Rabah bar Avuha did not know this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rabah bar Avuha:</span> Due to my poverty, I am not sufficiently fluent in the four tractates of the Mishnah we focus on in Bavel (Mo'ed, Nashim, Nezikin, Kodshim). All the more so I am not fluent in (Zera'im and) Taharos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Eliyahu took him to Gan Eden and told him to take leaves. As he was about to leave, he heard a voice saying that he was consuming his share in the world to come, so he threw down all the leaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>In any case, his garment had absorbed the smell. He sold it for a fortune, and divided the money among his sons-in-law.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CONDITIONS OF RETURNING A SECURITY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Im Ish Oni Hu Lo Sishkav ba'Avoto", but one may sleep in a rich person's garment (given for a security).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That is Ribis!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> The Beraisa means, a creditor may not sleep while holding an Oni's (night) garment in his house;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He may sleep with a rich person's garment in his house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven lends to Shimon, he may not be`Memashken him, he need not return his security to him, he transgresses all these Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> If Reuven lends to Shimon, he may not be Memashken him. If he was Memashken him, he must return it. If he does not return it, he transgresses all these Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> If Reuven lends to Shimon, he may not be Memashken him. He must return it to him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is if he was Memashken him after giving the loan, but if he was Memashken him when he gave the loan, he need not return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he was Memashken him after giving the loan and he does not return it, he transgresses all these Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shizbi - Beraisa):</span> "Ad Bo ha'Shemesh (before the sun rises) Teshivenu Lo" refers to a garment worn at night;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Hashev Tashiv Lo Es ha'Avot k'Vo ha'Shemesh (when the sun sets)" refers to a day garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Why should one return a night garment for the day, and a day garment for the night?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Shizbi:</span> I will no longer recite the Beraisa (there is a mistake in the text).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> The correct version is "Ad Bo ha'Shemesh Teshivenu Lo" refers to a day garment, which may be taken at night;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>"Hashev Tashiv Lo Es ha'Avot k'Vo ha'Shemesh" refers to a night garment, which may be taken during the day.</p>
