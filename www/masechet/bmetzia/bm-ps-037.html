<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DOES R. YOSI ARGUE IN THE FIRST MISHNAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> One may not profit through another's property. Rather, Levi pays Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah):</span> You said in Shmuel's name that R. Yosi argues even in the first Mishnah (and says that even if a Shomer chooses to pay, the owner receives Kefel). Does the Halachah follow R. Yosi also there?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Elazar agreed that R. Yosi argues there and that the Halachah follows him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Yosi agrees with Chachamim in the first Mishnah, because he already paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it only because he paid? R. Chiya bar Aba cited R. Yochanan to say that even saying that he will pay is enough!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan means that R. Yosi agrees in the first Mishnah, because he already said that he will pay.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE WHO DOES NOT KNOW WHOM HE OWES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #1):</span> If Reuven told two people 'I stole from one of you, and I don't know from which', or 'one of your fathers deposited money with me, but I don't know which', he pays both, because he admitted by himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one person deposited 100 Zuz with Reuven, and another person deposited 200, and each claims that he gave 200, and Reuven does not know who gave which, he gives each 100. We leave the rest until Eliyahu comes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi says '(this is improper,) for if so, the swindler does not lose (he has no incentive to admit)! Rather, all the money is left until Eliyahu comes (or one admits).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Similarly, if they deposited Kelim, and each claims the bigger Kli, one gets the smaller Kli, we give the other the value of the smaller from the larger, and we leave the rest (until Eliyahu comes);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yosi says, we leave all of it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> The Reisha teaches that when in doubt, we make someone pay. We do not say 'to take money from another, one must bring proof';</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> In the Seifa, Reuven does not pay due to his doubt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If one stole, Chachamim fined him to pay out of doubt. They did not fine one who accepted deposits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction #1:</span> Sometimes one who takes deposits is fined. When one of the fathers deposited money, Reuven pays both!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> There, Reuven is liable for forgetting who deposited (like two people who deposited money, each wrapped by itself);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven is exempt when two people deposited in front of each other, for this shows that they trust each other. He is not responsible to ensure that he remembers who gave which (it is like two people who deposited money wrapped together as one).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction #2:</span> Sometimes a thief is not fined!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #2 - R. Tarfon):</span> If Reuven stole from one of five people, and he does not know from which, and all of them say 'you stole from me', Reuven leaves in front of them what he stole, and walks away.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> When in doubt, we do not make someone pay. Rather, we follow Chazakah, and leave the money with the one holding it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that our Tana is R. Tarfon? (Perhaps it is R. Akiva, who argues!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> R. Tarfon admits that if one told two people 'I stole from one of you, but I don't know from which'; that he pays both.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In Mishnah #2, they claim from him. Letter of the law, he leaves in front of them what he stole, and walks away;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In Mishnah #1, Reuven wants to fulfill his obligation b'Yedei Shamayim, so he pays each.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Mishnah #1 says that he is liable 'because he admitted by himself.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We said that in Mishnah #2, they claim from him. What does he say?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah citing Rav):</span> He is silent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Masnah citing Rav):</span> He says that he does not recognize any of them. If he were silent, this would be considered an admission.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">37b----------------------------------------37b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Yehudah holds that here, his silence is not an admission. He can say 'I was silent to each, for I was thinking that perhaps this is the one.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He leaves in front of them what he stole, and withdraws.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Will they divide it and walk away?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Aba bar Zavda taught that one may not take any Metzi'ah that is Safek Hinu'ach (perhaps it was left intentionally). If he took it, he does not return it! (Rashi - if someone that claims he lost it, he must bring proof. Here also, the thief cannot give it up without proof. Ra'avad - just like one may not take when in doubt, the people who claim to own it may not split it without proof!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Safra):</span> The Mishnah means that he leaves what he stole (until Eliyahu or until one of them brings proof).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>R. AKIVA'S OPINION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> In Mishnah #2, R. Akiva says 'to clear himself from transgression, he must pay every one.' When in doubt, we make someone pay. We do not leave money in its Chazakah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah #3):</span> If a house fell on a man and his mother, and his heirs say that she died first (so the son inherited her), and her heirs say that he died first (and they inherit her), Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai agree that they split her property;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, I admit in this case that the property stays in its Chazakah. (Amora'im argue if he means that the son's or mother's heirs get it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> There, both parties are unsure. Regarding the theft, the claims against Reuven are definite, Reuven is unsure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In our Mishnah (when he stole from one of two people) all the claims are doubtful, and he pays each!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (The question assumes that our Tana is R. Akiva.) What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> R. Tarfon admits that if one tells two people 'I stole from one of you, but I don't know from which', he pays both;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Tarfon admits to R. Akiva, with whom he argues in the Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the claims against the thief are uncertain?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It does not say that they claim from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa - R. Chiya):</span> The case is, each says that he does not know if he was the victim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We said that our Mishnah discusses one who wants to fulfill his obligation b'Yedei Shamayim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>TWO DEPOSITORS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Did Rava really say that when two depositors gave money in two bags, the Shomer must remember who gave which?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rava - some say, Rav Papa]):</span> All agree that two people who deposited (different numbers of) animals with a shepherd, the shepherd leaves the animals in front of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> That is when they deposited the animals in his herd without his knowledge.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Similarly, if they deposited Kelim...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Mishnah needed to teach both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only about money, one might have thought that there Chachamim say to return 100 to each, for there is no loss, but regarding Kelim, there is a loss (Rashi - part of the big Kli is broken off; Nimukei Yosef - we sell the larger Kli, and it will not return to the owner), so Chachamim admit to R. Yosi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only about Kelim, one might have thought that there R. Yosi says that we leave them until Eliyahu comes, but regarding money, since we can give each 100 without a loss, he admits to Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> But R. Yosi's reason is in order that the swindler will admit! (Surely he argues even when there is no loss!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, both cases come to taught to teach Chachamim's opinion. The case of Kelim is a bigger Chidush than the case of money.</p>
