<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LIABILITIES OF THE <i>SHOMRIM</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is even like R. Yoshiyah. Here, we do not need "Oh" to separate.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Breakage is like partial death. Since he is liable for full death, he should pay also for partial death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a borrower is liable for theft or loss?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from breakage or death.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He is liable for those because the owner cannot retrieve it. If it was stolen or lost, the owner can toil and retrieve it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "V'Nishbar Oh Mes" - we learn theft or loss from a Kal va'Chomer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Shomer Sachar is exempt for breakage or death, yet he is liable for theft or loss. A borrower is liable for breakage or death. All the more so he is liable for theft or loss!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This Kal va'Chomer cannot be refuted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The following question does not refute the Kal va'Chomer.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is a stringency of a Shomer Sachar. He pays Kefel if he claims that armed robbers stole it (and really, he stole it himself)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is more stringent to pay principal, than to swear and be exempt (and pay Kefel if he stole it himself).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Tana holds that armed robbers are like regular robbers. (Kefel is only for a claim of theft.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that if one borrows b'Ba'alim (from his employee) he is exempt for theft or loss?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from breakage or death.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from them. They are Onesim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, we learn from a Shomer Sachar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a Shomer Sachar is exempt for these b'Ba'alim (if the depositor was working for the Shomer)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn liabilities of a Shomer Sachar (theft or loss) from the liabilities (explicit in the Torah) of a borrower (breakage or death). Just like a borrower is exempt b'Ba'alim, also a Shomer Sachar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What method teaches this?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from a 'Mah Matzinu' (just like we find here, the same applies there).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from breakage or death. They are Onesim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we learn from "<i>v</i>'Chi Yish'al" - the Vov teaches that the former Parshah (a Shomer Sachar) is learned from the latter (a borrower).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from a Shomer Sachar, for he is exempt for breakage or death!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, we learned that a borrower is liable for theft or loss from (a Kal va'Chomer from) a Shomer Sachar. We say Dayo (we cannot learn more than the source, i.e. not b'Ba'alim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is according to the opinion that says Dayo. According to the opinion that does not say Dayo, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer#3:</span> "<i>V</i>'Chi Yish'al" connects the Parshiyos. We learn each from the other.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>NEGLIGENCE <i>B'BA'ALIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha or Ravina):</span> One who borrowed b'Ba'alim and was negligent is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Acha and Ravina):</span> He is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first opinion learns the exemption of b'Ba'alim to the previous Parshah (a Shomer Sachar), not to the Parshah before the previous Parshah (a Shomer Chinam);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Therefore, a Shomer Chinam (who is liable only for negligence) is liable b'Ba'alim. We learn from a Kal va'Chomer that a Shomer Sachar or borrower is liable for negligence b'Ba'alim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The exemption of b'Ba'alim was written only regarding the other obligations of a Shomer Sachar and borrower.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The latter opinion holds that we learn also to two Parshiyos earlier. (A Shomer Chinam is liable only for negligence, and he is exempt b'Ba'alim. There is no source to obligate other Shomrim for negligence b'Ba'alim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Implied question:</span> What is the law?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven borrowed Shimon's cow and at the same time asked or hired Shimon to work for him, or if he asked or hired Shimon to work and later borrowed it, and the cow died, Reuven is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah does not say that a Shomer Chinam is exempt b'Ba'alim. (It must be that he is liable)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It does not mention a Shomer Sachar, even though he is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">95b----------------------------------------95b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We must say that the Tana teaches only a borrower because the Torah wrote b'Ba'alim regarding a borrower.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven borrowed Shimon's cow and (at the same time) asked Shimon to work for him, or if he rented the cow and hired Shimon, or he borrowed the cow and hired Shimon, or he rented the cow and asked Shimon to work, even if Shimon was working somewhere else when the cow died, Reuven is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We are thinking that the Beraisa is R. Yehudah, who says that a renter is liable like a Shomer Sachar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Tana teaches a renter, (even though his exemption b'Ba'alim is learned by expounding), but he does not teach about a Shomer Chinam. We must say that a Shomer Chinam is liable b'Ba'alim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> The Beraisa is R. Meir, who says that a renter is liable like a Shomer Chinam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Tana teaches that a Shomer Chinam is exempt b'Ba'alim, and the same applies to a Shomer Sachar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> The Beraisa is R. Yehudah, according to Rabah bar Avuha, who switches the opinions.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Avuha):</span> R. Meir says that a renter is like a Shomer Sachar, and R. Yehudah says that he is like a Shomer Chinam;</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN MUST THE OWNER BE WORKING FOR HIM TO BE CONSIDERED <i>B'BA'ALIM</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> Reuven (the borrower) is liable unless the owner was working with his animal, and he was working for Reuven from the moment he borrowed it until it broke or died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that "Ba'alav Imo" applies to the entire Parshah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rava - Beraisa):</span> If (at the same time) Reuven borrowed Shimon's cow and asked Shimon to work for him, or if he rented the cow and hired Shimon, or he borrowed the cow and hired Shimon, or he rented the cow and asked Shimon to work, even if Shimon was working somewhere else when the cow died, Reuven is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Shimon was not working on the same task as his cow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he was working on the same task.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says 'even if Shimon was working somewhere else'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that he was softening the ground in front of it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since the Seifa says that he was on (i.e. working with) the animal, the Reisha means he was doing a different task!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If Reuven borrowed Shimon's cow and later asked Shimon to work for him, or if he rented the cow and later hired Shimon, even if Shimon was on the cow when it died, Reuven is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In both clauses, Shimon was working with it. Each clause teaches a Chidush;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Reisha teaches that even though he was not on it, just engaged in the same task, since he was hired from the beginning of the rental, Reuven is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The second clause teaches that even though he was on it, since he was not hired from the beginning of the rental, Reuven is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If in the Reisha he was doing a different task and in the Seifa he was engaged in the same task, each would be a Chidush;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But if in both clauses, Shimon was engaged in the same task, what difference does it make it he was on it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Beraisa) Question:</span> Since it says "Im Ba'alav Imo Lo Yeshalem", we can infer that "Ba'alav Ein Imo Shalem Yeshalem"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The latter verse is extra, to teach that the exemption is only if Shimon was working for him when the animal was borrowed. It does not matter whether or not he was working for him when it broke or died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #3 (Beraisa) Question:</span> Since it says "Ba'alav Ein Imo Shalem Yeshalem", we can infer that "Im Ba'alav Imo Lo Yeshalem"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Im Ba'alav" is extra, to teach if the animal was borrowed b'Ba'alim, whenever it may die (even after the owner stops working for the borrower) he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rav Hamnuna is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Abaye holds like R. Yoshiyah, and expounds the verses like R. Yoshiyah. Rava holds like R. Yonason, and expounds the verses like R. Yonason.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> "Ba'alav Ein Imo Shalem Yeshalem" - he is liable because the owner was not working for him at either time, not the time of borrowing nor the time of death;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was working for him at one time, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Im Ba'alav Imo Lo Yeshalem" - he is exempt only if the owner was working for him at both times;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was working for him at only one time, he is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he was working for him only at the time of borrowing, he is exempt. If he was working only at the time of death, he is liable!</p>
