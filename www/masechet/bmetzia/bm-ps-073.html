<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DISCOUNTS FOR PAYING IN ADVANCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Reuven was carrying a bundle to a certain place. Shimon offered: 'I will take it and sell it for you. I will use the money, and later return to you according to what it sells for there':</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven bears any losses on the way, it is permitted (Rashi - for it is not a loan until he sells it; Tosfos - Reuven must pay Shimon's toil and food);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Shimon bears any losses on the way, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Reuven was carrying Peros to a certain place. Shimon offered 'give them to me (to eat), and I will return the same amount to you there.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven has Peros there, it is permitted; if not, not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Donkey-drivers may borrow money on condition to (Rashi - use it and later) return Peros according to the lower price in a different city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Question:</span> Why is this allowed? (They work for the buyer without any pay, just use of his money!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> The donkey-drivers gain. They become trustworthy in the eyes of sellers in the city where Peros are cheap. (On other occasions, they will give to them on credit.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Chananel) Question:</span> Why is this allowed? (Even though they are paid, they bear any loss on the way.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> They gain. The buyers tell them where Peros are expensive. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> The sellers give a discount to the donkey-drivers (Rashi - they fear lest the donkey-drivers stop buying from them, since they are not paid.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the answers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer:</span> They argue about a new donkey-driver. (The sellers start to trust him, but he does not get a discount.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Chananel) Answer:</span> They argue about a new lender. (He does not know where the price is expensive, but the donkey-drivers still get a discount from the sellers).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Grain was selling for four (measures for a Zuz) in Sura, and for six in Kafri. Rav gave money (in Sura) to donkey-drivers (to bring from Kafri), he accepted to bear losses on the way. He took from them five measures per Zuz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He is allowed to take six!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> An important person should not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Asi):</span> May this be done with (other merchandise such as) pieces of metal? (Perhaps the above reasons do not apply, for the donkey-drivers will not frequent the same sellers.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi wanted to do so with linen garments. Rebbi forbade him to.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Rebbi wanted to do so with pieces of metal. R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi forbade him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BENEFITS FOR PAYING IN ADVANCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> It is forbidden to give money (when grapes are immature) to receive mature grapes (later) at a low price.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> This is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav forbids. Since they are worth more later, this resembles Ribis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel permits. Since the buyer bears losses that may occur to the crop, it does not look like Ribis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Simi bar Chiya):</span> Rav admits about oxen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> In a vineyard harvested using oxen, this is permitted, because the oxen get caught in the vines and losses are common.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> Rav admits that it may give money (at a low price) for calves that will be born during the year, since miscarriages are common.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #3 (Rambam):</span> Rav admits that one may give money (at a low price) for calves to receive them when they are grown, for they often grow weak or die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> There were people who used to lend grain to their sharecroppers (for planting) and receive back (after it grew) new grain.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> You must help them plow or harvest a bit (so you are entitled to wages). If not, this is a loan of a Se'ah on condition to return a Se'ah, which is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> There were people who used to pay in advance to receive a greater value of vines after the harvest.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> You must make an acquisition in the land now (to acquire the vines). If not, this is a loan, it is forbidden (since loss is not common).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>People who guard standing crops used to be paid after the grain was harvested and threshed. They received extra due to the delay.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> (This is Ribis.) You must help a bit at the granary, in order that your work continues until then, for then there is no delay in your wages (to attribute the higher wage to it);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Wages are due to be paid only at the end of the job.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rabanan (to Rava):</span> You receive Ribis!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We rent fields for four Korim of grain, which we receive in Nisan. You receive six Korim a month later!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> You act improperly!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The land belongs to the renter until the grain fully ripens. You may not make him leave in Nisan!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>I receive rental when it is due, in Iyar.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">73b----------------------------------------73b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav Mari bar Rachel took a house for a Mashkanta from a Nochri, who then sold it to Rava. A year later, Rav Mari gave a year's rent to Rava (for the coming year).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Mari:</span> Within one year, the Nochri could not have removed me from the house even if he paid the loan. From now onwards, I must pay rent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Had I known that it was your Mashkanta, I would not have bought it. Now that I know, I take the law of the Nochri (for I am in place of  him. Had he not sold to me,) until he paid you, he would not receive rent. I also will not take rent until I force him to pay you. (It is not Ribis for Rav Mari to live there for free, for Rava does not owe anything to him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava of Barnayish):</span> Rabanan take Ribis! They pay for wine in Tishrei and take it in Teves, and the seller bears the loss if it sours in between!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> If it soured in between, that shows that it was not proper wine from the beginning. They paid for wine, not for vinegar!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE LAW OF THE LAND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Before the harvest, I give money for wine. I receive an extra measure. Is this permitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Yes. Since there was no Tenai, this is just a gift.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> The sellers do not own the land. They pay the tax for abandoned land and work it. Is the wine forbidden because the land was stolen?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> No. The king has rights over the land. He says that whoever pays the land tax, he gets the Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> There are Rabanan who pay the head-tax of people, and make them work for them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The king is master over all his subjects. He says that whoever pays another's head-tax may make the person work for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rav Se'oram (Rava's brother) used to grab indecent people and make them pull Rava's rickshaw.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support (Rava - Beraisa):</span> If one does not act properly, you may force him to work for you - "l'Olam Bahem Ta'avodu uv'Acheichem" (forever you will work with Kena'ani slaves and with your brothers)";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this applies even to someone acting properly!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Uv'Acheichem Bnei Yisrael (you may not work harshly)."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ASMACHTA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chama):</span> If Reuven gave Shimon money to buy wine, and he was negligent and did not, he must give him wine like it sells at the major market (cheaply).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Zvid of Neharda'a):</span> That is only if he asked for (unspecified) wine. If he asked for a specific wine, he just gets back his money. We do not know if they would have agreed to sell it to him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Even if he asked for (unspecified) wine, he just gets back his money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even if he promised to give his wine if he will not buy, this is only Asmachta. There was no acquisition.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between this and the following?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one rented a field on condition to give a certain amount of (its) Peros, and accepted to pay if he will not work the field, this is binding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, he can surely work the field. Here, there is no guarantee that they would sell to him.</p>
