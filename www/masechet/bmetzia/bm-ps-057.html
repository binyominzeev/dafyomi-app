<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>AN ERROR ABOVE A SIXTH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ami):</span> The Mishnah listed things to which Ona'ah (returning an overcharge or undercharge of a sixth) does not apply. Is the sale invalid if the error was more than this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> He later concluded that the sale is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yonah citing R. Yochanan):</span> Ona'ah does not apply to Hekdesh, but cancellation of the sale does apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah citing R. Yochanan):</span> Ona'ah does not apply to land, but cancellation of the sale does apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yonah said so about Hekdesh (even though only one party, i.e. the person, erred). All the more so it applies to land (in which the buyer and seller erred);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yirmiyah said so about land, but regarding Hekdesh, the sale is never invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If 100 Maneh (10,000 Dinarim) were redeemed on a Perutah, the redemption works.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven said 'this Korban is redeemed onto this animal' if the Korban was blemished, it is redeemed, but Reuven must compensate Hekdesh if the redemption is worth less than the Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Mid'Oraisa, it is redeemed. Mid'Rabanan, Reuven must compensate Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Mid'Oraisa, Reuven must compensate Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the mistake was a sixth, why would Reish Lakish say that mid'Oraisa, he must compensate Hekdesh? Our Mishnah teaches that Ona'ah do not apply to Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it was more than a sixth, how could R. Yochanan say that mid'Oraisa, it is redeemed? R. Yonah cited R. Yochanan to say that regarding Hekdesh, the redemption is cancelled!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Really, it was more than a sixth. The opinions must be switched.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They argue about Shmuel's law (that any amount of Hekdesh can be redeemed on a Perutah). Reish Lakish holds like Shmuel, and R. Yochanan does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, both hold like Shmuel. They argue about whether or not l'Chatchilah, one may redeem Hekdesh on less than its value;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Reish Lakish says that it is l'Chatchilah (therefore, only mid'Rabanan he must compensate Hekdesh);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yochanan says that it is b'Di'eved. Therefore, mid'Oraisa he must compensate Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, the mistake was a sixth. The opinions need not be switched. They argue about Rav Chisda's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The Shi'ur of Ona'ah does not apply to Hekdesh. Even if it was less than a sixth, Hekdesh must be compensated.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Ribis and Ona'ah apply to people, not to Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We can answer like we answered our Mishnah. This means that Ribis and the Shi'ur of Ona'ah do not apply to Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> Here, a commoner in more stringent than Hekdesh. (According to Rav Chisda, Hekdesh is more stringent!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to Ribis, regarding which a commoner is more stringent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa should also teach (regarding Ona'ah) 'here, Hekdesh is more stringent than a commoner'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. Ribis is the only stringency of a commoner above Hekdesh, so it is proper to say 'here, a commoner is more stringent.' Hekdesh has many stringencies over a commoner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of Ribis regarding Hekdesh?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Gizbar lent 100 on condition to get back 120, the Gizbar transgressed Me'ilah, and the money is his (and he owes Hekdesh. This is Ribis of a commoner!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Hoshaya):</span> The case is, Reuven accepted to supply Hekdesh with flour for four Sa'im per Sela, and the price rose to three Sa'im per Sela. He supplies like he stipulated. (One may not contract with a commoner until the price stabilizes, i.e. many people are selling it in the market.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one accepted to supply Hekdesh with flour for four Sa'im per Sela, and the price rose to three Sa'im per Sela, he supplies for four;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he accepted to supply for three Sa'im per Sela, and the price declined to four Sa'im per Sela, he supplies for four, because Hekdesh has the upper hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> The case is, the Gizbar lent 100 rocks used for building on condition to get back 120;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The building materials are Chulin. We give what is built to Hekdesh only after finishing (to avoid accidental Me'ilah).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who steals them does not pay Kefel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Al Kol Devar Pesha" is a Klal. "Al Shor Al Chamor Al Seh Al Salmah" are Peratim. "Al Kol Aveidah" is another Klal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Klal u'Frat u'Chlal teaches everything similar to the Prat, in this case, something movable that has intrinsic value;</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Hekdesh is excluded, for it says "l'Re'ehu".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He does not pay four or five...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This is because the Torah discusses four or five, not three or four. (Four or five is the total of principal,  Kefel, and another two or three; we expounded that he is exempt from Kefel.)</p>
