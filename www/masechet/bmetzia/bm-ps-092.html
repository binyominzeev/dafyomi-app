<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>AN ANIMAL MAY EAT FROM THE LOAD IT CARRIES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One must let a donkey eat while they unload it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (They unload it at once.) What does it eat?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, one must let a donkey eat until they unload it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One must let a donkey or camel eat from the load it carries.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW MUCH MAY AN EMPLOYEE EAT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A worker may eat even a Dinar's worth of gourds or dates;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Eliezer Chisma says, a worker may not eat more than his wages;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim permit this, but we teach a person not to be gluttonous, for then no one will hire him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Chachamim agree with the first Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They argue about whether or not we teach people not to be gluttonous. The first Tana holds that we do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They argue about Rav Asi's law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> Even if a worker was hired to harvest only one cluster, he may eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> Even if a worker harvested only one cluster, he may eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rav Asi needed to teach both laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Had he taught only the first law, one might have thought that since nothing will remain for the owner, he may eat, but when he will (later) harvest for the owner, he must harvest before eating;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Had he taught only the second law, one might have thought that there he may eat for he will later harvest for the owner, but if the owner will be left with nothing, he may not eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> The first Tana agrees with Rav Asi. He may eat the gourds or dates, even if he will not harvest for the owner. Chachamim argue. They permit eating more than his wage, but not all that he harvests.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ritva):</span> The first Tana argues with Rav Asi. His Chidush is only that he may eat a Dinar's worth. Chachamim agree with Rav Asi. They permit eating more than his wage, but not all that he harvests.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> They argue about Rav's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> In a hidden scroll (even before Chachamim permitted writing oral Torah, one was allowed to write reminders for himself), Isi ben Yehudah says "Ki Savo b'Cherem Re'echa" permits anyone (not only a worker) to eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> This does not allow any (farmer) to survive!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (Rav Kahana):</span> Perhaps Isi permits only one who (was not hired, but) works in the land the value of what he eats!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did Rav object to the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One prefers to choose workers to harvest his land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> The first Tana argues with Isi. He permits (only) a worker to eat. Chachamim agree with Isi. They say 'we teach a person (even not a worker) that it is not <i>advisable</i> to be gluttonous!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Chananel, in Shitah Mekubetzes):</span> The first Tana agrees with Isi (like Rav Kahana explained). One who works is called a worker, even if he was not hired. Chachamim argue with Rav. They permit eating more than one's <i>wage</i>. This implies that he was hired.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DOES A WORKER OWN WHAT HE EATS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does a worker own what he eats? Or perhaps he does not own it, just the Torah permits him to eat?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This determines whether or not he may give what he is entitled to eat to his family;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he owns what he eats, he may give them;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If the Torah merely allows him to eat, it did not allow others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> A worker may eat even a Dinar's worth of Kishus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he owns what he eats, we cannot say that he was hired for a sixth of a Dinar, and he eats (and owns) a Dinar's worth!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Even if we say that the Torah merely allows him, this is astounding!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We must say that indeed the Torah entitles him. We can equally say that it entitles him to own what he eats!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah - R. Eliezer Chisma):</span> A worker may not eat more than his wages;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim permit this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Eliezer holds that he owns what he eats, and Chachamim say that the Torah merely allows him to eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, they do not argue about that. All agree that if not for "k'Nafshecha", he could eat more than his wages;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer expounds "k'Nafshecha" - he may eat as much as his wages, for which he risks his Nefesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim expound "k'Nafshecha" - your worker is like yourself. If you muzzle him, you are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa):</span> If a Nazir was harvesting grapes, and he said 'let my family eat what I am entitled to', they may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he owns what he eats, he may give them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is a decree to dissuade a Nazir from harvesting grapes. Nezirim should stay far from vineyards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Beraisa):</span> If a worker said 'let my family eat what I am entitled to', they may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he owns what he eats, he may give them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That refers to a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The other Beraisa discusses a Nazir!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are different Beraisos, so they may teach the same law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Beraisa):</span> If a worker said 'let my family eat what I am entitled to', they may not, for it says "v'El Kelyecha Lo Siten".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps it refers to a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa attributes the law to "v'El Kelyecha Lo Siten", not because a Nazir should avoid vineyards!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, it is because a Nazir should avoid vineyards;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since the Beraisa calls him a worker, it cites the verse of a worker, but this is not the true source.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #6 (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was hired to set figs to dry, he may eat without tithing. (The final processing for Ma'aser was not done, so the Torah lets him eat, and this is not a sale);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">92b----------------------------------------92b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he stipulated 'on condition that I and my son may eat', or 'on condition that my son may eat in place of my wages (Rashi; Tosfos - in place of my eating)', Reuven eats without tithing, but his son must tithe before eating.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he owns what he eats, why must his son tithe what he eats? Just like he is exempt, his son should also be exempt (Tosfos - on the amount his father would have eaten)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Ravina):</span> Mid'Oraisa, the son is exempt. Chachamim decreed that he tithes, because it looks like a sale.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DOES A WORKER OWN WHAT HE EATS? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #7 (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven hired Shimon to work with Reva'i (fruits of a tree in its fourth year; they have Kedushah like Ma'aser Sheni), Shimon may not eat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven did not tell him that he will work with fourth-year Peros, Reuven must redeem what Shimon wants to eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the Torah allows workers to eat, why must Reuven redeem so Shimon can eat? The Torah never allows workers to eat fourth-year Peros!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is like a mistaken contract (he agreed to work assuming that he may eat).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #8 (Seifa):</span> If Shimon was hired to repress rings of figs that came apart or reseal barrels that were opened, he does not eat (since they were Kavu'a for Ma'aser);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven did not tell him that he will work with such Peros, Reuven must tithe them and allow Shimon to eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the Torah allows workers to eat, what is the reason? The Torah never allows workers to eat Tevel!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps also, it is like a mistaken contract.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Granted, repressing figs is like a mistaken contract (Shimon thought that they were not pressed yet), but resealing barrels is not. Shimon knows that the wine is Tevel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> The case is, the wine spilled back into the pit. (He was hired to draw it from the pit. He thought that it was not yet barreled.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Wine is Tevel once it flows into the pit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is R. Akiva, who says that it is Tevel after Kipuy (removal of the grape skins and pits that float on top of the wine in the pit).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shimon had no reason to assume that he would eat. Perhaps Kipuy was already done!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses  a place where the one who draws from the pit does Kipuy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> We need not say that the wine spilled back into the pit. Rav Zvid taught that Chachamim say that wine is Tevel after Kipuy, and R. Akiva says that it is after doing Shiluy (removal of the dregs that float on top of the wine in the barrel);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shimon did not know that Shiluy was done.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shimon had no reason to assume that he would eat. Perhaps Shiluy was already done!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses  a place where the one who corks the barrel does Shiluy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #9 (Mishnah):</span> Shimon may stipulate with his employer to receive extra wages in place of eating. He may also stipulate on behalf of his wife and adult children and slaves, because they have intelligence (they can pardon their right to eat);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He may not stipulate on behalf of his animals or minor children or slaves, because they lack intelligence.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We are thinking that Shimon feeds his children and slaves, therefore he gets their wages.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If the Torah allows workers to eat, we understand why he cannot stipulate. Minors do not acquire the food until they eat it!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>But if a worker owns what he eats, it is like part of his wages. It is Shimon's, why can't he stipulate for them?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The case is, he does not feed them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why can he stipulate for adults?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If they agree, they pardon their privileges.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #10:</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not or not a worker owns what he eats.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (R. Hoshaya - Beraisa):</span> Shimon may stipulate on behalf of himself, his wife and adult children and his (adult or minor) Kena'ani slaves, but not on behalf of his animals or minor children. (The Mishnah did not allow stipulating on behalf of minor slaves.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah and Beraisa both discuss when he feeds them. The Mishnah holds that the Torah allows workers to eat, the Beraisa holds that a worker owns what he eats. (One may not stipulate for animals, for this would entail muzzling.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> No, both hold that a worker owns what he eats;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Mishnah, he does not feed them. In the Beraisa, he feeds them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If in the Beraisa, he feeds them, why can't he stipulate for his minor children?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah does not authorize a father to cause pain to his children.</p>
