<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>BREAKAGE THROUGH USAGE (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Reuven borrowed a bucket from Shimon, and it broke.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> Bring witnesses that you did not use it abnormally, and you are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Reuven borrowed a cat from Shimon, and mice ganged up on it and killed it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Is this like dying during work?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mordechai):</span> Yes. (He was not negligent for putting it in a dangerous place. A proper cat would not be killed by mice.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Reuven borrowed a cat from Shimon, and it ate too many mice, got overheated and died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Is this like dying during work?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mordechai):</span> Yes. (He was not negligent; the cat killed itself.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT IS CONSIDERED WORKING?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one wants to borrow something and be exempt, he should ask the lender 'give me a drink of water.' This is b'Ba'alim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the lender is sharp, he will tell the borrower 'I will give you after you take the object.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If any of the following lends (to the one he works for) while working, it is considered b'Ba'alim: a teacher of children (who lends to the parents), one hired to plant a vineyard for half the Peros, a slaughterer, a blood-letter, and the town Sofer (scribe, or barber).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rabanan (to Rava):</span> You work for us (you teach us.  If we borrow from you, we are exempt.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> No, you work for me. I decide which tractate we learn, and you cannot protest!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The Halachah is, in the period before the festival, when the Rebbi must teach laws of the festival, he works for them. At other times, they work for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Mereimar bar Chanina rented a mule to people of Bei Chuzai. He went out to help them load it. They were negligent, and it died; Rava obligated them to pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> This is negligence b'Ba'alim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava was embarrassed. Later, it was found that Mereimar did not go to help, rather to ensure that they did not overload his mule.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, according to the opinion that exempts negligence b'Ba'alim, we understand why Rava was embarrassed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that obligates negligence b'Ba'alim, why was he embarrassed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was not a case of negligence. Rather, it was stolen and died in the thief's premises. Rava obligated them to pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> This was b'Ba'alim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava was embarrassed. Later, it was found that Mereimar did not go to help, rather to ensure that they did not overload his mule</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A <i>SAFEK</i> ABOUT WHICH ANIMAL DIED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven borrowed Shimon's cow for half the day and rented it for half the day, or he borrowed it for today and rented it for tomorrow, or he borrowed one cow and rented another; the cow (in the last case, one of them) died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon claims that the borrowed cow died (or, in the first cases, that at the time it died it was borrowed), and Reuven is unsure, he must pay.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">97b----------------------------------------97b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven claims that the cow that died was rented, and Shimon is unsure, Reuven is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If Shimon claims that the cow that died was borrowed, and Reuven says that it was rented, Reuven swears that it was rented and he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If both are unsure, Reuven pays half.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> If Levi claims that Yehudah owes him money and Yehudah says 'I don't know', he must pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refutes Rav Nachman!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna and Rav Yehudah):</span> If Levi claims that Yehudah owes him money and Yehudah says 'I don't know', he must pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman and R. Yochanan):</span> Yehudah is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Our Mishnah discusses a case like Rav Nachman said (elsewhere), that Reuven must swear to Shimon (about something else. Therefore, Shimon can demand that he include in the oath that the borrowed cow did not die. Reuven must swear, and he cannot, for he is unsure, so he must pay.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what case must Reuven (pay because he cannot) swear to Shimon?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a case like Rava taught;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If David claimed 100 from Moshe, and Moshe admits to 50, and he does not know about the other 50, since Moshe must swear and he cannot, he must pay.</p>
