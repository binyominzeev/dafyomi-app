<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TRANSPORTING A BARREL (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Even on an incline, he can swear only if witnesses were not present. If witnesses were there, he must bring witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Isi ben Yehudah):</span> "Ein Ro'eh, he will swear" - if people saw, he must bring witnesses to be exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> (All agree that R. Meir holds that one who trips is negligent.) It is a Rabbinical enactment that he may swear and be exempt. Otherwise, no one would agree to transport a barrel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he swear?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> He swears that he did not break it intentionally;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yehudah says that a Shomer Chinam swears, but a Shomer Sachar must pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Elazar says that he heard that both are exempt, but he does not understand why;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, a Shomer Chinam can swear that he was not negligent, but a Shomer Sachar pays even if he was not negligent!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even a Shomer Chinam is exempt only if he fell on an incline. If he fell on level ground, this is negligence!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Even on an incline, if witnesses were there, he must bring witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Isi ben Yehudah):</span> "Ein Ro'eh" - if people saw, he must bring witnesses to be exempt.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE <i>HALACHAH</i> FOLLOWS ISI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Reuven was transporting a barrel of wine in the market of Mechuza, and it broke on a beam jutting out into the Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Many people are in the market. You must bring witnesses to be exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef (Rava's son):</span> This is according to Isi!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Yes, the Halachah follows Isi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Reuven asked Shimon to buy 400 jugs of wine. He did, and they all soured.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Such an occurrence would be known. Shimon must bring proof that he brought proper wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> This is according to Isi!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Yes, the Halachah follows Isi.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LIABILITY FOR BREAKAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Chiya bar Yosef enacted that people who carry on shoulder-poles (one burden in front of the person and one in back) must pay half if the load breaks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more than one person should carry, but it is not enough that people would hire two workers for it. It is between Ones and negligence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>One who carries on a cross-poles (it straddles the shoulders, one burden on the right, one on the left) must pay fully if the load breaks. (This is a load fit for two people, it was negligence to carry it himself).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rabah bar bar Chanah hired workers to transport barrels. A barrel broke. He took their shirts to pay for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> Give them back their shirts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> Is that the Halachah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> Yes! "L'Ma'an Telech b'Derech Tovim" (you must go beyond the letter of the law).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He returned their shirts. They petitioned 'we are poor. We worked all day, and we have nothing to eat!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> Pay their wages.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> Is that the Halachah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> Yes! "V'Orchos Tzadikim Tishmor".</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK HA'SOCHER ES HA'PO'ALIM</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ALL IS ACCORDING TO THE LOCAL CUSTOM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven hired workers and told them to start early and finish late, if this is not the local custom, he cannot force them;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Where the custom is to feed them, he must feed them. Where the custom is to supply relish with the bread, he must do so. all is according to the local custom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A case occurred in which R. Yochanan ben Masya told his son to hire workers. His son promised to feed them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> They descend from Avraham, Yitzchak and Yakov. Even if you give them a banquet like of King Shlomo, this does not suffice! Before they start working, tell them that you promise them only bread and legumes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, there was no need for this. All is according to the local custom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The first law is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he pays them more than the usual wage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that this is in order that they will start early and finish late. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. They can say, we get extra so we will work well.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">83b----------------------------------------83b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> (The standard workday is from sunrise until dark, i.e. when stars are visible.) A worker goes home on his own time (he leaves at dark), and comes to work on his employer's time (he leaves his house at sunrise) - "Tizrach ha'Shemesh... Yetzei Adam l'Fa'alo vela'Avodaso Adei Arev".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should follow the local custom!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Reish Lakish's law is for a new city.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should follow the custom of the place the residents came from!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They come from different places with different customs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He teaches about one who said 'I hire you according to Torah law.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>ELIMINATING THE WICKED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> "Tashes Choshech vi'Yehi Lailah" refers to this world, which resembles night. "Kol Chayso Ya'ar" refers to the wicked, who are like beasts of the forest. "Tizrach ha'Shemesh" - the sun will shine for the Tzadikim. "Ye'asefun" - the wicked will be gathered to Gehinom. "V'El Me'onosam Yirbatzun" - every Tzadik will have a place according to his honor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Yetzei Adam l'Fa'alo" - the Tzadikim go to receive their reward. "Vela'Avodaso Adei Arev" refers to one who finished his work before he died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon found a king's official who used to seize thieves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> How do you catch them? The verse compares them to beasts! Perhaps you get Tzadikim instead!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The official:</span> I must do what the king decrees!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> Do the following. At the fourth hour of the day, see who is drinking wine in the store and dozing, and ask about him.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he is a Chacham, he is tired because he rose early to learn;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If he is a worker, he rose early to work;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>If he works at night, he is tired from working at night;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>If none of these apply, he is a thief. Seize him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The king heard about this. He appointed R. Elazar to seize thieves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Korchah (to R. Elazar):</span> Vinegar, son of wine (your father was a Tzadik, but you are not)! How can you deliver Hash-m's people to be killed?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> I am only eliminating the thorns from the vineyard!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Let Hash-m remove them Himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>One day a launderer called R. Elazar 'vinegar, son of wine'. R. Elazar reasoned that anyone so brazen must be evil. He had him seized.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Later, R. Elazar decided that the launderer was not worthy to die. He went to redeem him, but was unable to. He applied to him "Shomer Piv u'Lshono Shomer mi'Tzaros Nafsho". The launderer was hung; R. Elazar cried.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Onlookers:</span> Don't feel bad. He and his son had relations with a betrothed Na'arah on Yom Kipur!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Elazar was comforted. 'Even people I am unsure about deserve to die. All the more so, people I am sure about deserve to die! Worms will not consume my innards after death.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He tested this. They removed fat from his stomach and put it in the hot sun; it did not rot.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Fat normally does not rot in the sun!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If there is redness (of flesh) with it, it does. R. Elazar's did not rot, even though there was flesh with it - "Af Besari Yishkon la'Vetach."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>A similar case occurred with R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Eliyahu:</span> How can you deliver Hash-m's people to be killed?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> The king commanded. What can I do?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Eliyahu:</span> Your father fled to Asya. You can flee to Ludkiya!</p>
