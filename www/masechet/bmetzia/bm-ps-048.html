<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE CURSE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Reish Lakish - Mishnah):</span> ...However, Chachamim said 'He who punished the generations of the flood and the dispersion, He will punish one who does not honor his word.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If (mid'Oraisa) coins acquire, we understand why one who retracts is cursed this way.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if coins do not acquire, one who retracts merely does not fulfill his word. Is he cursed for this?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Chachamim said that a garment acquires a Dinar, but a Dinar does not acquire a garment, and they do not force the seller to give it. However, Chachamim said, He who punished the generations of the flood and the dispersion, the people of Sodom and Amora and the Mitzriyim at the sea, He will punish one who does not honor his word;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If one verbally agreed to buy or sell, this is not a Kinyan. Chachamim are displeased with one who retracts.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> There is no curse for this, just Chachamim are displeased.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If one verbally agreed to buy or sell, and money was given, and he retracts, he is cursed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one verbally agreed to buy or sell, but money was not given, and he retracts, he is not cursed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A verse and a Beraisa support Reish Lakish.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A verse supports him - "and he will deny to his colleague a deposit, bi'Seshumes Yad... or Oshak..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> "Bi'Seshumes Yad" refers to a Kli that the borrower designated to be a security for a loan (a borrower brings a Korban for denying the loan and swearing falsely only if he designated a security);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Oshak" is a Kli that the employer designated to be security for paying his worker.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>When the Torah discusses his admission, it says "he will return... ha'Oshek...", but it does not mention Teshumes Yad!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It omits this because the lender need not return it, for he never acquired it, for he never did Meshichah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Perhaps the Torah need not say that he returns it, because we learn from Oshek!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We cannot learn from Oshek. The case of Oshek is when the worker took the Kli for a security, and returned it to the employer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it is a deposit! (The verses also discuss denying and returning a deposit.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah discusses two kinds of deposits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the Torah should also mention returning Teshumes Yad, when the lender took the Kli for a security and returned it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it done so, we would not know whether or not Meshichah is needed. Now that it is omitted, we learn that (sometimes one need not return it, for) Meshichah is needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah teaches about returning Teshumes Yad!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Everything mentioned (regarding the denial) is also alluded to in the verse of returning - "Oh mi'Kol Asher Yishava Alav la'Sheker".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> This comes to include (that one must return) Teshumes Yad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In any event, it was not mentioned explicitly. (This teaches that it is only returned when it is like a deposit, i.e. the lender took it for a security, and returned it. This is because Meshichah is needed to acquire it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Reish Lakish - Beraisa):</span> If b'Shogeg Reuven gave Hekdesh money to a bathhouse attendant (to pay for a bath that he will take), Reuven transgressed Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> This refers only to a bathhouse attendant, for nothing requires Meshichah. When Meshichah is required, Me'ilah takes place only when he is Moshech (for this completes the transaction).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1):</span> If b'Shogeg Reuven gave Hekdesh money to a barber (so he will cut his hair), Reuven transgressed Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We should say that Me'ilah is only after he is Moshech the instruments used to cut!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses a Nochri barber, who does not acquire through Meshichah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa #2):</span> If b'Shogeg Reuven gave Hekdesh money to a barber, ship driver or any professional, he does not transgress Me'ilah until he makes Meshichah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This contradicts Beraisa #1!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beraisa #1 discusses a Nochri barber. Beraisa #2 discusses a Yisrael barber.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Money acquires mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Levi (in his own Tosefta):</span> If b'Shogeg Reuven gave Hekdesh money to a wholesaler, Reuven transgressed Me'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">48b----------------------------------------48b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This contradicts Reish Lakish (he did not do Meshichah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That teaching is like R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHO CURSES?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> However, Chachamim said, He who punished...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Beis Din informs him (the one who wants to retract) that Hash-m will punish him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Beis Din curses him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye did not say they curse him, for this is forbidden - "v'Nasi v'Amecha Lo Sa'or"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava says that that applies only to "Amecha", one who acts like a Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rava learned from an episode in which people paid R. Chiya bar Yosef money to buy salt. Salt rose in price.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Honor the sale. If not, you will accept on yourself 'He who punished...'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Beis Din merely informs him, there would be no need to inform R. Chiya bar Yosef!!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If Beis Din curses him, could one imagine that R. Chiya bar Yosef would accept a curse of Chachamim?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case was, they gave partial payment. R. Chiya thought that he is obligated to sell only as much as was paid. R. Yochanan told him that he must honor the entire sale.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PARTIAL PAYMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Partial payment obligates the seller to give only the value of what was paid;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It obligates him to sell the entire object.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> If Reuven gave Shimon a security (to guarantee that he will buy a certain matter from Shimon) and said 'if I retract, you may keep this', and Shimon said 'if I retract, I will give double your security (worth of what he sells)', their Tanayim (stipulations) take effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like R. Yosi holds elsewhere, that Asmachta (an exaggerated promise) takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, Reuven acquires only as much as the value of the security (and if he retracts, he gets back his security);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon ben Gamliel:</span> They argue about when he said 'my security should acquire (like a security. It is not the beginning of payment)';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>But if Reuven was buying land and paid half the price, he acquires it all immediately. The rest of the money can be given years later.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The same applies to Metaltelim. (Money 'acquires' them, i.e. the seller cannot retract without suffering the curse.) Part of the money also 'acquires' all of them (like land) without any Tenai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, money 'acquires' only its own value of Metaltelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between land and Metaltelim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Money truly acquires land, therefore, part of the money acquires all of it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Money 'acquires' Metaltelim only to obligate the seller to suffer a curse if he retracts. Part of the money does not 'acquire' all the Metaltelim.</p>
