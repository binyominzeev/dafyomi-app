<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PICKING UP A <i>METZI'AH</i> FOR ANOTHER PERSON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> In our Mishnah, Shimon said before picking it up that he picks it up for himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Seifa):</span> If after giving it to Reuven, he said 'I acquired it for myself first', Reuven acquired it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously, he means that he acquired for himself first (when he picked it up). Why does it say 'first'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that in the Reisha, (he did not need to say 'first' because) he said before picking it up that he picks it up for himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rav Nachman says that it says 'first' only in the Seifa to teach that in the Reisha, even though he does not say 'first' (i.e. that he intended for himself when he picked it up), he acquires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman and Rav Chisda):</span> If Shimon picked up a Metzi'ah for Reuven, Reuven does not acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like one who seizes property (from a borrower) for a creditor when this causes a loss to others (other creditors would have wanted to seize the property); he does not acquire. (Here also, others would have wanted to take the Metzi'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> A worker keeps Metzi'os that he finds. This is only if the employer hired him for a particular job, e.g. 'weed for me today';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'work for me today', the employer gets it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> A worker is different. His Yad (power of acquisition) is like the Yad of his employer (he acquires for his employer).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Rav taught that a worker can quit his job in the middle (this shows that he is not a mere Yad of his employer)!!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Until he quits, his Yad is like his employer's Yad;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He can quit because "to <i>Me</i> Bnei Yisrael are slaves" - they are not slaves to slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> If Shimon picked up a Metzi'ah for Reuven, Reuven acquires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the Mishnah, Reuven does not acquire (even if Shimon did not say that he picks it up for himself until later)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> In the Mishnah, Reuven asked Shimon to <i>give</i> it to him, he never asked him to <i>acquire</i> it for him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A PERSON'S FOUR <i>AMOS</i> ACQUIRE FOR HIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven saw a Metzi'ah and fell on it, and Shimon grabbed it, Shimon keeps it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Reish Lakish):</span> In every place, the four Amos around a person acquire for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim enacted this to avoid fights (to grab Metzi'os).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (R. Chiya bar Yosef - Mishnah):</span> If Levi took some Pe'ah and threw it on the rest, this does nothing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he fell on it or threw his garment on it, others may take the Pe'ah from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The same applies to a forgotten sheaf (Shichechah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If the four Amos around a person acquire for him, he should keep what he fell on!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, he did not say that his four Amos should acquire for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Chachamim enacted, he should not need to say anything!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> By falling on it, he shows that he wants to acquire by falling, not through his four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> Chachamim enacted four Amos in public areas, not in a private field.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though the Torah allows poor people to enter the field, this is only to take the Pe'ah, but it is not considered their field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rav Idi bar Avin - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven saw an Aveidah and fell on it, and Shimon grabbed it, Shimon keeps it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the four Amos around one acquire for him, he should keep what he fell on!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, he did not say that his four Amos should acquire for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Chachamim enacted, he should not need to say anything!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> By falling on it, he shows that he wants to acquire by falling, not through his four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Sheshes):</span> Chachamim enacted four Amos only in a Simta (a corner next to Reshus ha'Rabim, where people make transactions), where it is not so crowded; but not in the main road.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reish Lakish said that in <i>every</i> place, a person's four Amos acquire!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'In every place' comes to include the sides of a Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ACQUISITION THROUGH ONE'S <i>CHATZER</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> A (minor) girl does not acquire through her Chatzer, nor through her four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> She acquires through her Chatzer and her four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan holds that the Torah teaches that a Chatzer acquires like one's hand. Just like she has a hand (to acquire a Get), she has a Chatzer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reish Lakish holds that the Torah says that a Chatzer acquires like a person's Shali'ach. Just like a Shali'ach does not acquire for her (minors cannot make Sheluchim), her Chatzer does not acquire for her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does anyone hold that a Chatzer acquires like a person's Shali'ach?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> A thief is liable if the stolen object "is found in his hand." What is the source to include his roof, Chatzer or storage area?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The doubled verb "Himatzei Simatzei" includes them.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If they acquire (theft) like Sheluchim, they would be Sheluchim for an Aveirah. We hold that Ein Shali'ach l'Dvar Aveirah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> Ein Shali'ach l'Dvar Aveirah only when the Shali'ach is liable for transgressing. A Chatzer is not liable, so (it can be a Shali'ach l'Dvar Aveirah, and) the person is liable for what the Chatzer acquires.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, if Reuven told a (married) woman or a slave to steal, is Reuven liable because they are exempt?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Women and slaves are liable, just they cannot pay now;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the slave was freed or the woman became divorced, he or she must pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sama):</span> Ein Shali'ach l'Dvar Aveirah only when the Shali'ach can choose whether or not to comply. A Chatzer has no choice, so (it is a Shali'ach, and) the person is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the two answers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about a Kohen who told a Yisrael 'be Mekadesh a divorcee to me', or a man who told a woman 'cut a boy's sideburns for me';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since they can choose whether or not to obey, Rav Sama exempts the Meshale'ach (the one who told them) for the Shali'ach's actions;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since they are not liable for these actions, Ravina obligates the Meshale'ach for the Shali'ach's actions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does anyone hold that a Chatzer does not acquire like a person's hand?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> It says "(and he will give a Get) in her hand." What is the source to include her roof, Chatzer or storage area?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "And he will give" (is written before "her hand", suggesting that he can put it in other places as well).</p>
