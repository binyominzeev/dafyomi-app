<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN DO WE DIVIDE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #1):</span> If Reuven traded a cow for Shimon's donkey, or he sold a slave, and the cow or slave gave birth (elsewhere), and Reuven says that the birth was before the sale (so the child is mine), and Shimon says that the birth was after the sale, they divide the offspring;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven had two slaves (or fields), one big and one small, and Shimon says 'I bought the big one', and Reuven is unsure which he sold, Shimon gets the big one.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven says, 'I sold the small one' and Shimon is unsure, he gets the small one.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Shimon says 'I bought the big one', and Reuven says 'I sold the small one', Reuven swears that he sold the small one;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If each says 'I don't know', they divide them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> (In the first clause) why do they divide? The one in whose premises the baby lies is Muchzak. The other must bring proof to take from him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> The case is, the calf is in the swamp, and the slave is by the selling-block (neither owns the premises).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The seller is Muchzak. The buyer must bring proof to take from him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is Sumchus, who says that when we are in doubt, we divide the money without an oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Sumchus (explicitly) said that they divide without swearing only when both parties are unsure. Would he say this when both parties make definite claims?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> Yes, Sumchus' law is even when both make definite claims.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Sumchus said that they divide without swearing only when both parties are unsure;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In our Mishnah, Reuven says '<i>perhaps</i> the birth was before the sale', and Shimon says  'perhaps it gave birth after the sale.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If each says 'I don't know', they divide them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, according to Rava, in the Reisha and Seifa, each side is unsure.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, according to Rabah bar Rav Huna, the Reisha teaches that they divide when each is certain. It need not teach this when each is unsure!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the Seifa we deduce that in the Reisha, both are certain. Otherwise, we might have thought (like Rava) that both are uncertain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If Shimon says 'I bought the big one', and Reuven says 'I sold the small one', Reuven swears that he sold the small one.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand according to Rava. Sumchus says that we divide the money only when neither side is sure.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But according to Rabah bar Rav Huna, even when both are sure, Sumchus says that they divide!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When one party is obligated to take an oath mid'Oraisa, Sumchus agrees (that he swears and gets like he says).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE CASE OF THE OATH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #1):</span> Reuven had two slaves, one big and one small...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Questions:</span> (When Shimon claims the big one and Reuven says that he sold the small one,) why does Reuven swear?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> His admission is not part of what Shimon claimed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> This is Heilach (he gives him the small slave (or land) he admits to at the time of the admission)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> We do not swear about slaves (or land)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to all three questions - Rav):</span> Reuven and Shimon argue about the <i>money</i> of a big or small slave or field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2A (Shmuel):</span> They argue about the clothing of a big or small slave, or the piles of grain of a big or small field.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">100b----------------------------------------100b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they argue about the clothing of a big or small slave, Question #1 remains. The admission is unlike what was claimed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2B:</span> We answer like Rav Papa taught (below), that 'clothing' refers to fabric from which to make clothing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Hoshaya):</span> The Mishnah does not discuss clothing. It discusses slaves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3A (R. Hoshaya):</span> They argue about a big or small slave with the clothing he wears, or a big or small field with the piles of grain in it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also regarding a clothed slave, Question #1 remains. The admission is not a portion of the claim! (A small garment is not a portion of a larger garment.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3B (Rav Papa):</span> 'Clothing' refers to fabric from which to make clothing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Sheshes):</span> Does the Mishnah teach that once he must swear about Metaltelim, he must swear about land (or slaves)? Another Mishnah teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one must swear about Metaltelim, his opponent can make him swear also about land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4A (to Question #3 - Rav Sheshes):</span> The Mishnah is R. Meir, who says that slaves are considered Metaltelim (so we swear about them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Question #1 remains. The admission is not a portion of what was claimed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4B (to Question #1 - Rav Sheshes):</span> R. Meir holds like R. Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Yehudah claimed wheat and Levi admitted to owing only barley, Levi is (totally) exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Gamliel says, he is liable (to swear that he does not owe wheat. Most explain, he must also pay the barley.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Question #2 remains. This is Heilach!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4C (to Question #2 - Rava):</span> Reuven does not return the small slave or land intact. He cut a limb off the slave, or dug pits in the land.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DO WE SWEAR ABOUT SLAVES AND LAND?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Answer #4A):</span> R. Meir holds that slaves are like land (which we do not swear about)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #2):</span> If a man stole an animal or slaves and they grew old, he pays like at the time of the theft;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir says, regarding slaves he can say 'here are your slaves.' (Slaves are like land, so they are never considered to be stolen.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We can answer like Rabah bar Avuha, who switches the opinions in Mishnah #2. R. Meir says that one must pay for slaves (for they are unlike land). Chachamim exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Mishnah #1 holds that we swear about land.) What is the source that R. Meir equates land to slaves, to teach that we swear about land? Perhaps we swear about slaves, but not about land!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa #1 - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven traded a cow for Shimon's donkey, or he sold a slave, and the cow or slave gave birth (elsewhere), and one party says 'I owned the mother at the time of birth (so the child is mine)', and the other party is silent, the party claiming the child gets it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If both parties are unsure, they each own half the child;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If both parties claim the child, the original owner of the mother swears that he still owned her at the time of birth (and he gets the child), for mid'Oraisa, the one who swears does not pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, we do not swear about land or slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Chachamim say that we do not swear about land. This implies that R. Meir says that we swear about land!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps Chachamim came to argue with R. Meir only about slaves., and say 'you should admit that we do not swear about slaves, just like you admit that we do not swear about land!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rejection - Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> There are things that are (attached) like land, but they are not considered land (so we swear about them; Chachamim disagree);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven claims that he entrusted ten laden vines to Shimon, who only admits to five, Shimon must swear;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, anything attached is like land (we do not swear about it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> They argue about grapes ready to be harvested. R. Meir considers them as if they are already harvested, and Chachamim do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>(Rav Sheshes' answer does not answer Question #3, i.e. why does he swear about land? However,) we can defend R. Hoshaya's answer (according to Rav Papa, that they argue about a big or small slave and fabric to make clothing for him, or a big or small field with piles of grain in it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to Question 2:i):</span> Even though another Mishnah teaches that one who must swear about Metaltelim must swear about land, Mishnah #1 is needed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that (fabric for) a slave's clothes are considered like a slave (and we do not swear about this), and piles of grain in a field are like a field. Mishnah #1 teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DIVIDING WHEN IN DOUBT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If each says 'I don't know', they divide them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Beraisa is Sumchus, who says that when we are in doubt, we divide the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If both parties claim the child, the original owner of the mother swears that he still owned her at the time of birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rabah bar Rav Huna, Sumchus' law is even when both make definite claims. Why does the seller swear? They should divide it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When one party is obligated to take an oath mid'Oraisa, Sumchus admits that he swears and gets like he says;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We must establish it like Rava. He cut a limb off the slave, therefore it is not Heilach.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>SELLING OLIVE TREES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven sold his olive trees to Shimon for the wood, and before he cut them, they produced poor olives, which yield less than a Revi'is of oil per Se'ah of olives, Shimon keeps them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they produced olives that yield a Revi'is of oil per Se'ah, and Shimon claims 'it is due to my trees', and Reuven claims 'it is due to my land', they divide them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a river flooded Levi's trees and deposited them in Shimon's land, and they produced olives, and each claims 'it is due to my trees/land', they divide them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven told Shimon to cut the trees immediately, even if the olives yield less than a Revi'is, they belong to Reuven (Shimon had no right to leave the trees standing)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he told Shimon to cut them whenever he wants, even if the olives yield a Revi'is, they belong to Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did not specify;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One is not concerned about poor olives that yield less than a Revi'is. One is concerned about olives that yield a Revi'is.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> The Mishnah discusses producing a Revi'is, i.e. profit (above the expenditures of harvesting and pressing the olives).</p>
