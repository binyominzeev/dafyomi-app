<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW MUCH IS THE <i>CHOMESH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was Makdish his field and offers to redeem it for 20, the same as others offer, he redeems it, because he adds a Chomesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon offers to redeem the field for 21, Reuven must pay 26 (the 20 he offered and five for the fifth, plus another one because he may not pay less principal than Shimon's offer).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Likewise, if Shimon offers between 22 and 25, Reuven must pay five more: the Chomesh of his own offer, and Shimon's offer. He need not add a Chomesh of the excess of Shimon's offer over his own.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since the Chomesh of 20 is five, this shows it is an outer fifth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Tana'im argue whether it is an outer or inner fifth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yoshiyah):</span> "V'Yasaf Chamishiso Alav" - it and the fifth are five (i.e. it is four, the fifth is one, an outer fifth);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yonasan says, "Chamishis<i>o</i> (its fifth)" - the fifth is of the principal (an inner fifth).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IS THE <i>CHOMESH</i> ESSENTIAL?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the fifth was not given, was the redemption valid?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does the principal redeem, and the Chomesh is a separate obligation?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps the Chomesh is Me'akev (essential for redemption)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> Chomesh and Bi'ur do not apply to Ma'aser Sheni of Demai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> One must pay principal (to redeem it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The reason is, since principal is Me'akev redemption of mid'Oraisa Ma'aser, it applies to mid'Rabanan Ma'aser;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since the Chomesh is not Me'akev for mid'Oraisa Ma'aser, it does not apply to mid'Rabanan Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about whether the Chomesh is Me'akev.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If one gave the principal (to redeem Ma'aser) but not the Chomesh, he may eat it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua says, he may not eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rebbi says, presumably, R. Eliezer's opinion is true for Shabbos, and R. Yehoshua's opinion is true for a weekday.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> They argue about both Shabbos and weekdays.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Eliezer holds that the Chomesh is not Me'akev, and R. Yehoshua holds that it is Me'akev!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> No, all agree that the Chomesh is not Me'akev (mid'Oraisa);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about whether or not (mid'Rabanan) we are concerned lest he neglect to pay it. R. Yehoshua is concerned, and R. Eliezer is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> All agree that Hekdesh is redeemed without the Chomesh. Since Gizbarim (treasurers of Hekdesh) demand payment from people in the market, we are not concerned lest one not pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> They argue about Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If one gave the principal (to redeem Hekdesh) but not the Chomesh, it is redeemed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, it is not redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rebbi says, presumably, we follow R. Eliezer regarding Hekdesh, and we follow Chachamim regarding Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This implies that they argue both about Hekdesh and Ma'aser!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Correction (R. Yochanan):</span> All agree regarding Hekdesh that on Shabbos, it is considered redeemed without the Chomesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Firstly, "v'Korasa la'Shabbos Oneg" (therefore, Chachamim should be lenient to enable enjoyment of Shabbos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Secondly, since Gizbarim demand payment from him in the market, surely he will pay.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IS THE <i>CHOMESH</i> LIKE THE PRINCIPAL?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rami bar Chama):</span> Hekdesh cannot be redeemed on land, for it says "v'Nasan ha'Kesef v'Kam Lo";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Can the Chomesh be redeemed on land?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rami bar Chama):</span> If a Zar ate Terumah b'Shogeg, he must pay Chulin for it (it becomes Terumah when the Kohen receives it) - "v'Nasan la'Kohen Es ha'Kodesh", i.e. something that can become Kodesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Must the Chomesh be from Chulin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #3 (Rami bar Chama):</span> One cannot redeem Ma'aser on an Asimon. "V'Tzarta ha'Kesef b'Yadecha" includes anything with a Tzurah (image);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Can the Chomesh be redeemed on an Asimon?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to all three questions - Rava):</span> Regarding all of these it says "Alav." The Chomesh has the same law as the principal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Ravina - Mishnah):</span> If one stole Terumah and did not eat it, he pays twice the value of the Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he ate it, he pays one principal and a Chomesh from Chulin, and a second principal, the value of the Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">54b----------------------------------------54b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This teaches that the Chomesh is like the principal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Regarding theft, it says "va'Chamishisav Yosef Alav".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven paid the principal, and (falsely) swore that he also paid the Chomesh, he must pay (the Chomesh and) an additional Chomesh of the Chomesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Each time he swears falsely about paying a Chomesh (of a Chomesh ...) he is liable to add a Chomesh of what he swore about, until the denied money is less than a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Regarding a Zar who b'Shogeg eats Terumah, it says "v'Yasaf Chamishiso Alav";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Zar ate Terumah b'Shogeg, he pays principal and a Chomesh. This applies to one who ate, drank or anointed, whether the Terumah was Tahor or Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He pays the Chomesh and (if he eats the Chomesh after he gave it to the Kohen, which makes it Terumah) a Chomesh on the Chomesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Regarding Ma'aser, we have no verse nor Mishnah teaching that he adds a Chomesh on the Chomesh. We have no doubt (clearly, if one redeems his Ma'aser and later redeems the redemption money, he (adds a second Chomesh on the principal but) does not add a Chomesh on the Chomesh, for we have no source for this).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Regarding Hekdesh, it says "v'Yasaf Chamishis";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who redeems Hekdesh adds a Chomesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> The Mishnah says that he adds a Chomesh. It does not say that he adds a Chomesh on the Chomesh (if he redeems the redemption). What is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Terumah, it says "v'Yasaf." One can take the 'Vav' and append it to "Chamishiso", to make 'Chamishisav' (its fifths);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding Hekdesh, it says Chamishis. Even if we append the 'Vav', we are left with 'Chamishiso' (one fifth)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should know the law because it is secondary Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> One adds a Chomesh on initial Hekdesh, but not on secondary Hekdesh (it became Kodesh through redeeming Hekdesh).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papi):</span> Rava meant, the Chomesh is like initial Hekdesh (since it does not come in place of another Kedushah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the conclusion?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Tavyumi):</span> "V'Yasaf Chamishis Kesef Erkecha" - the Torah equates the Chomesh to money of Erchin (principle);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like one adds a Chomesh to principle, also to the Chomesh.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SECONDARY <i>HEKDESH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> One adds a Chomesh on initial Hekdesh, but not on secondary Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> He learns from "ha'Makdish" (one who makes new Hekdesh), not ha'Matfis (one who imbues Chulin with the Kedushah of existing Hekdesh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(A Tana, i.e. one who recites Beraisos):</span> "Ba'Behemah ha'Teme'ah" - just like a Tamei animal is initial Hekdesh, and the owner has no part in it (it is Hekdesh of Bedek ha'Bayis), and Me'ilah applies to it, Me'ilah applies to any initial Hekdesh in which the owner has no part.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> Granted, 'the owner has no part in it' excludes Kodshim Kalim. Since the owner has a share, there is no Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What does 'initial Hekdesh' come to exclude? Can you say that Me'ilah applies only to initial Hekdesh, but not to secondary Hekdesh?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it refers (not to Me'ilah, rather) to the Chomesh (which applies to Secondary Hekdesh), like R. Yehoshua ben Levi taught?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">The Tana:</span> That is what I meant.</p>
