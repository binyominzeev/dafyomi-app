<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO DOES NOT KNOW TO DESPAIR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rava - Beraisa):</span> If property of Reuven was taken by a Ganav (covert thief), Gazlan (open robber) or (overflowing) river and given to Shimon, Shimon may keep it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven is aware of a Gazlan or river, but he is not aware of a Ganav!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> In the Beraisa, 'Ganav' refers to armed robbers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It also mentions a Gazlan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It discusses two kinds of robbers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Abaye - Beraisa):</span> If a river took Reuven's beams, wood and rocks and deposited them on Shimon's property,  he may keep them, because Reuven despaired.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Unless (we heard that) Reuven despaired, Shimon could not keep them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The case is, Reuven could save them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If Reuven was chasing after them, Shimon must return them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven could save them, even if he was not chasing them, Shimon must return them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, Reuven could save them with difficulty.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he chases them, he shows that he does not despair. If not, we may assume that he despairs.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TAKING <i>TERUMAH</i> FOR ANOTHER PERSON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> In what case can one separate Terumah without the will of the owner, and it takes effect?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reuven entered Shimon's field, gathered fruit, and separated Terumah without consulting Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon considers Reuven's separation of Terumah to be theft, the Terumah does not take effect. If not, it takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know whether or not he considers it to be theft?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If when Shimon sees him, he says 'why didn't you take nicer ones?', and there are nicer fruit that Reuven did not select for the Terumah, Shimon is being sincere, and the Terumah takes effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Reuven took the best fruit, Shimon is being sarcastic. He resents that Reuven 'stole' the best fruit to be Terumah, so it does not take effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If Shimon gathered fruit and added to the Terumah that Reuven separated, whether or not Reuven took the best fruit, Reuven's separation takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When we find that there is better fruit, how does the separation take effect?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>At the time Reuven called it Terumah, he did not know whether or not Shimon would agree to it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava, on behalf of Abaye):</span> The case is, Shimon had made Reuven a Shali'ach to separate Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text) Support:</span> Presumably, this is correct. Had he not made him a Shali'ach, the Terumah could not take effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"You... also you" includes that a Shali'ach (and only a Shali'ach!) may separate Terumah for the owner;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like the owner separates like he wants, the Shali'ach can separate only if the owner wants him to.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The case is, Shimon did not tell Reuven which fruit to make Terumah. Most people select average Peros to be the Terumah, but Reuven took nicer Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Shimon said 'why didn't you take nicer ones?' If there are nicer fruits, the Terumah takes effect. If there are no nicer fruits, it does not take effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Gra and many Rishonim) Objection:</span> Is this reasonable?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"You... also you" - this includes that a Shali'ach may separate Terumah for the owner. Just like the owner separates like he wants, the Shali'ach can separate only if the owner wanted him to.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Once Reuven was appointed, it doesn't matter if Shimon approves of the fruits he selected!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shimon did not specify which fruits to take, and most people select average Peros to be the Terumah, but Reuven took nicer Peros. Therefore, unless we see that Shimon approves, he was not authorized to do this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shimon said 'Why didn't you take nicer ones?' If there are nicer fruits, the Terumah takes effect. If there are no nicer fruits, it does not take effect. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Ameimar, Mar Zutra and Rav Ashi came to Mari bar Isak's orchard. Mari's sharecropper put dates in front of them. Ameimar and Rav Ashi ate, but Mar Zutra did not. Mari found them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Mari (to his sharecropper):</span> Why didn't you give them from these nice ones?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Ameimar and Rav Ashi (to Mar Zutra):</span> Why don't you eat now?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If there are better fruits, the Terumah takes effect (because the owner is sincere).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Mar Zutra:</span> Rava taught that 'why didn't you take nicer ones?' applies only to Terumah, for people are happy to do Mitzvos (nicely);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Here, (perhaps) Mari suggested giving nicer ones only because he was embarrassed (to say that he did not want to give us).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Peros were still wet from dew and the owner was pleased, they are Huchshar (receive Tum'ah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they became dry, even if the owner was later pleased, they are not Huchshar.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is because current satisfaction is never considered as if he was pleased retroactively.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Hechsher is an exception. It says "Ki Yiten (when he will put, i.e. willingly)" - he must be happy when the liquid is (put) on the Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, when the Peros were still wet when he was pleased, why are they Huchshar?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like Rav Papa taught;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rav Papa):</span> It is written "Yiten (he will put)", but tradition says to read this like "Yutan (will be put)"!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Resolution (Rav Papa):</span> We require that (a liquid) will be put, similar to when he will put. Just like a man puts only if he wants to put, he must want that the liquid was put.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan citing R. Yishmael ben Yehotzedek):</span> What is the source that one may keep something that was taken by an overflowing river?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan citing R. Yishmael):</span> "And so you will do to his donkey... that will be lost from him, and you found it (you must return it)" applies only when it is lost from him, but available to others. It excludes what is hopeless for anyone to retrieve it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Presumably, the case of something forbidden to take resembles what is permitted. Just like one is permitted something (in the river) whether or not it has a Siman, also one is forbidden to take an Aveidah (on the land) whether or not it has a Siman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This refutes Rava. The Halachah follows Abaye against Rava in six places, whose acronym is YA'AL KAGAM:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Yud - Yi'ush (despair) without knowledge;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Ayin - Edim Zomemim are disqualified retroactively;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Lamed - (Rashi - Lechi (a post to permit carrying in an alley); Tosfos - Leidah (days of childbirth on which blood is not seen; or, Lo Efshar (inevitable), undesired benefit from something forbidden);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>Kuf - Kidushin that forbids the couple to have relations;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span>Gimel - Giluy (revealing) intent to nullify a Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span>Mem - Mumar (a wanton sinner) who sins to fulfill his desires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> Since the Halachah follows Abaye, why may we eat dates that fall off other people's trees in the wind?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Since vermin eat dates that fall, people despair from them from the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the owners are orphans (minors), how can we answer? Their despair is invalid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is an unusual case, we are not concerned for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Questions:</span> If we know that the owners are minors, what is the law? If a wall of stones surrounds the tree, what is the law? (Rashi - vermin cannot eat them; Aruch - this shows that he wants them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, then it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A <i>SIMAN</i> THAT WILL NOT LAST</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may keep (small) bundles of sheaves found in the Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rabah):</span> This is even if they have a Siman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that a Siman that is apt to be (destroyed when) trampled is not a valid Siman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One may keep them only if they do not have a Siman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Rava holds that a Siman that is likely to be trampled is a valid Siman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rabah):</span> A Siman that is likely to be trampled is not a valid Siman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It is a valid Siman. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rava - our Mishnah and the Seifa (25a)):</span> One may keep bundles of sheaves found in the Reshus ha'Rabim. If one found bundles of sheaves in a Reshus ha'Yachid, he takes them and announces (to return them).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If there is no Siman on them, in a Reshus ha'Yachid, why must he return them?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, there is a Siman on them, and in the Reshus ha'Rabim, he keeps them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> A Siman that is likely to be trampled is not a valid Siman. This refutes Rava!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (for Rava):</span> Really, there is no Siman on them, but the place they were found is a Siman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rabah holds that the place is not a Siman; they explicitly argued about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> The place is not a Siman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It is a Siman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One may keep (small) bundles of sheaves found in the Reshus ha'Rabim. If he found them in a Reshus ha'Yachid, he takes them and announces.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Big bundles of sheaves, whether in a Reshus ha'Yachid or Reshus ha'Rabim, he takes them and announces.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is difficult for Rabah and Rava. (What is the difference between big and small bundles?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> Small bundles of sheaves have Simanim. In the Reshus ha'Rabim, the Siman will be trampled (so the finder keeps them). in a Reshus ha'Yachid, they will not be trampled;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Big bundles, because they are tall, are not trampled even in a Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The only Siman on the bundles is their place. In the Reshus ha'Rabim, bundles get kicked around, so they do not remain where they were left. In a Reshus ha'Yachid, they remain where they were left;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Big bundles, because they are heavy, are not kicked around even in a Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
