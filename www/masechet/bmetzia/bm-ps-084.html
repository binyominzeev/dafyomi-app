<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF CERTAIN <i>CHACHAMIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon and R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi were very fat. A Nochris taunted them 'surely, you (cannot have relations, and) did not father your wives' children.' They refuted her claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did they answer her? "Al Ta'an Kesil k'Ivalto (do not answer foolish words of a fool)!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They needed to avert any suspicion about their children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi's bicep (or thigh - Ritva; Rabeinu Peretz - daily food intake) was like a pouch of nine Kavim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan's and Rav Papa's were also big (but not as big).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yochanan was a remnant of the beautiful people of Yerushalayim. (Tosfos - he lived long after the Churban! Rather, he remained from such a family. Others explain that he was born before the Churban and lived very long. He cites Halachos in the name of R. Shimon and other Tana'im.) One may get a taste of his beauty by seeing light reflecting off a new silver Kli.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learned that the beauty of Rav Kahana was a taste of the beauty of R. Avahu, whose beauty was a taste of the beauty of Yakov Avinu, whose beauty was a taste of the beauty of Adam ha'Rishon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan was not listed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only because he lacked a beard (Rashi; Maharsha - he had a radiant countenance, but the shape of his face was not outstanding).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yochanan used to sit by the Mikvah when women would return from immersing. They would see him, and this caused their children to be beautiful and learn Torah like him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> Aren't you afraid of Ayin ha'Ra'ah (harsh judgment due to envy)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> I descend from Yosef. Ayin ha'Ra'ah does not rule over his seed - "Alei Ayin";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> We read this 'Olei Ayin' (they rise above the (evil) eye).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> We learn from "v'Yi<i>dg</i>u la'Rov" - just like Dagim (fish) are covered by water, they are not in eye's scope, similarly, the seed of Yosef are not in scope of Ayin ha'Ra.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW REISH LAKISH BECAME A GREAT <i>CHACHAM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>One day R. Yochanan was bathing in the Yarden river. Reish Lakish (who was then a robber), struck by R. Yochanan's beauty, jumped across the river. R. Yochanan hoped to channel Reish Lakish's strength to Torah. He offered 'if you return to Torah, you may marry my sister, who is more beautiful than I.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Reish Lakish agreed. He was unable to leap across the river to get his Kelim (the acceptance to learn sapped his strength). R. Yochanan taught him, and he became great in Torah. One day they were learning about Tum'ah of Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When are a sword, knife, dagger, spear, and sickle considered finished, so that they receive Tum'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> It is when they are reheated in the furnace.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> It is when they are burnished in water.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> A robber knows about robbers' tools!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Reish Lakish:</span> You did not help me. I am called Rebbi now, and also before (I learned from you) I was called Rebbi (of thieves! Maharsha - this is how R. Yochanan understood. Really, Reish Lakish meant that he was a Rebbi in Torah and knew about these Kelim even before he was a thief.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> I brought you under the wings of the Shechinah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yochanan felt bad, and Reish Lakish fell sick. His wife asked R. Yochanan (her brother) to pray for Reish Lakish, if not for his sake, for her son or herself (that they not become an orphan or widow).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan refused - "Azvah Yesomecha... v'Almenosecha Alai Tivtachu" (I  will care for you).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Reish Lakish died; R. Yochanan missed him sorely. Rabanan sent R. Elazar to replace him, for he was very sharp. Whatever R. Yochanan said, he found a support for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> You are no replacement! Reish Lakish would ask 24 questions against whatever I said. I would give 24 answers, and learning increased;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>You only support me. I already know that I teach according to the Halachah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yochanan tore his clothing, cried and went crazy. Rabanan requested mercy for him, and he died.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">84b----------------------------------------84b</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>R. ELAZAR B'REBBI SHIMON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>In spite of the supports that R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon handed over only Resha'im (83b), he was concerned lest he handed over a Tzadik. He requested afflictions. At night they would put 60 felt blankets under him. During the day they would pour over him 60 basins of water. Blood from his boils would fill 60 basins. His wife would make for him 60 types of food from figs; he would recover. She would not let him go to the Beis Medrash, lest he be pressed (to answer questions, which could aggravate his condition).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>At night he would invite the afflictions; in the morning he would expel them, lest they detract from his Torah. Once his wife heard this. She was outraged that he caused his own afflictions, which depleted her father's wealth. She rebelled against him and went to her father's house. Sailors (who were saved from mortal danger in his merit) gave him a gift of 60 slaves bearing 60 wallets of money, who prepared his special remedy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>His wife asked her daughter to check on him. He told her 'we (Chachamim) have more wealth than my wife's family - "mi'Merchak Tavi Lachmah"'. He ate, drank and recovered and went to the Beis Medrash. Women came asking about blood stains of 60 different hues. He declared that all of them are Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rabanan were skeptical. He said 'if I am correct, all 60 women should have male children.' It was fulfilled, and they called the children Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> The evil kingdom (Romi) withheld the birth of many children by making R. Elazar seize thieves (and be absent from the Beis Medrash).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Before he died, he told his wife 'I know that many Rabanan are angry at me (for handing over their relatives). They would not eulogize me properly. Leave me in the attic and do not worry.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani:</span> I heard second-hand from his wife that he was there between 18 and 22 years. She would check his hair. When a hair was taken from him, he would bleed. One day she saw a worm coming from his ear. That night, he explained to her in a dream that this was because once he heard a Chacham shamed and did not protest enough.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>People would come for judgment. They would state their claims, and a voice from the attic would give the verdict.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> One day his wife quarreled with a neighbor. She was cursed 'you should be like your husband, unburied.' Rabanan heard, and decided that it is time to bury him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> R. Shimon (his father) came to Rabanan in a dream, telling them that it is time to bury his son.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The people of his city would not allow the burial, since they were protected from beasts all the years he was in the attic. On Erev Yom Kipur they were busy, and people from a nearby village took the body. They brought him to the cave where his father was buried; a snake guarded it from outside. They asked permission to let the son come to his father; the snake allowed them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rebbi inquired to marry his widow. She refused, because 'you (Rebbi) are like Chulin compared to R. Elazar.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> Granted, he was greater in Torah. Was he greater in deeds than me?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">His widow:</span> I did not know if he was greater in Torah, but I know that he was greater in deeds than you. He accepted on himself afflictions!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Rebbi say that R. Elazar was greater than him in Torah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi and R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon used to sit on the ground in front of R. Shimon ben Gamliel and R. Yehoshua ben Korchah (and other Rabanan), who were on benches. Rabanan learned much from Rebbi and R. Elazar, they felt that they should also be on benches.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon ben Gamliel:</span> Perhaps Ayin ha'Ra'ah will rule over my son (Rebbi)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Korchah:</span> We must also be concerned for R. Elazar!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>R. Elazar was insulted by the idea that Rebbi was (equally important and therefore) prone to Ayin ha'Ra. Previously, R. Elazar used to support Rebbi's teachings;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Now, when Rebbi said that he had a question, R. Elazar would say 'this is what you want to ask; this refutes you. You have asked enough questions without substance!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi was dejected. His father consoled him:</span> do not expect to be as great as him. His father was a lion. Your father is a fox!</p>
