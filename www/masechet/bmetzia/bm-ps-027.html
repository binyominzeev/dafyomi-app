<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MONEY FOUND IN PRODUCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven bought Peros...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> This is only if he bought from a merchant (who buys fruit and sells it). If Shimon sold his own Peros, surely they are Shimon's coins.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A Chacham recited in front of Rav Nachman a Beraisa teaching Reish Lakish's Halachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> Even if they are Shimon's Peros, did he thresh them himself?! (Perhaps a worker dropped the coins!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">The Chacham:</span> I will no longer recite the Beraisa (there is a mistake in the text).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> It is not mistaken. The case is, Shimon's Kena'ani slave threshed it. (Even if it is from the slave, the money is Shimon's.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE PARTICULAR <i>AVEIDOS</i> MENTIONED IN THE TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We already knew (from the verse, without "Simlah") that one must return a garment. It wrote "Simlah" to teach the general rule: just like a garment has signs and people claim it, also anything that has Simanim, and people will claim it, the finder must announce it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Question):</span> How did the verse already teach that one must return a garment?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It says "Kol Aveidas Achicha (any Aveidah of your brother)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Why did the Torah write (four examples of Aveidos,) "ox, donkey, Seh (sheep or goat) and garment"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Torah must teach all four cases:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only about a garment, one might have thought that we return Aveidos only through witnesses about the object itself or Simanim on the object itself;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Donkey" teaches that we return a donkey through witnesses or Simanim on the saddle.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>"Ox" teaches that we must return even the hair at the end of the tail.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>"Seh" teaches that we must return the shearings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since "ox" obligates returning even the tail hair (which is worth very little), it need not teach that we must return shearings!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Rava):</span> We do not know why the Torah wrote "Seh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, according to R. Yehudah, we do not know why the Torah wrote "donkey" regarding animals that fall in a pit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Seh teaches that one must return the dung!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> People make it Hefker.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it teaches that Simanim are mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Halachah is, we return Aveidos through a medium Siman. We are unsure if this is mid'Oraisa or mid'Rabanan. Perhaps it is mid'Oraisa, and "Seh" teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Tana of our Mishnah said that "Simlah" teaches about Simanim, so we cannot say that "Seh" teaches this.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>EXPOUNDING THE <i>PARSHAH</i> OF <i>AVEIDOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Asher Tovad (that will be lost)" excludes an Aveidah worth less than a Perutah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, "u'Motzasah (and you will find it)" excludes an Aveidah worth less than a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They argue only about which verse teaches the law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim learn from "u'Motzasah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They learn Ravnai's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Ravnai):</span> "U'Motzasah" connotes that it came to your hand (and even so, you need return only your brother's object, but not a Nochri's).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yehudah learn from "Asher Tovad"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches R. Yochanan's law;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> What is the source that one may keep an Aveidah taken by an overflowing river?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> "So you will do to any Aveidah Asher Tovad Mimenu (that will be lost <i>from him</i>) and you will find it" - (one must return) things that are lost from him only, not something that is lost (irretrievably) from everyone.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yehudah learn Ravnai's law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from the extra 'Vav' in "<i>u</i>'Motzasah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim learn R. Yochanan's law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They learn from "Mimenu (from him)".</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yehudah holds that we cannot learn this from "Mimenu."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> They argue about an Aveidah worth a Perutah that declined in value to less than a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim learn from "Asher Tovad" - anything worth a Perutah when lost must be returned, even if later it is worth less;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah learns from "u'Motzasah" - you must return an Aveidah only if it is worth a Perutah when you find it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Chachamim should admit that "u'Motzasah" implies that it is worth a Perutah when you find it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> Rather, they argue about an Aveidah worth less than a Perutah that rose in value to a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim learn from "Asher Tovad" - if it was not worth a Perutah when it was lost, it need not returned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah learns from "u'Motzasah" - you must return it if it is worth a Perutah when you find it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Yehudah should admit that "Asher Tovad" implies that it was worth a Perutah when it was lost!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rava):</span> Rather, they argue about an Aveidah worth a Perutah that declined in value, then rose and is again worth a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim learn from "Asher Tovad" - since it was worth a Perutah when it was lost, it must be returned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah learns from "u'Motzasah" - you must return it only if it was worth a Perutah from when it was lost until you found it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ARE SIMANIM MID'ORAISA?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Halachah is, we return Aveidos through a (medium) Siman. Is this mid'Oraisa or mid'Rabanan?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">27b----------------------------------------27b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This determines whether we can rely on a Siman to (say that a Get found is the same Get that a Shali'ach lost, and) return the Get to him (and he will use it to divorce);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the law is mid'Oraisa, it applies also to a Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If it is an enactment mid'Rabanan, it was enacted only for money, but not for Isurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> We already knew that one must return a garment. It wrote "Simlah" to teach the general rule: just like a garment has signs and people claim it, also anything that has Simanim, and people will claim it, the finder must announce it. (Since we learn from a verse, it is mid'Oraisa.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The verse teaches only that it must have people who will claim it. The mention of Simanim is an allusion to the Rabbinic enactment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> "Chamor" teaches that we return a donkey through Simanim on the saddle.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It means, through witnesses that recognize the saddle.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa) Question:</span> Why does it say "it will be with you until Derosh Achicha (your brother demands it)"? Surely one does not return it before this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, this teaches that you must be Doresh (investigate) if he is lying.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> You ask him to give a Siman!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, you require him to bring witnesses testifying that it is his.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Mishnah):</span> Witnesses may testify (to identify a corpse to permit the widow to remarry) only if they saw the face with the nose, even if there are Simanim on the body and clothes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that Simanim are not mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Mishnah discusses unreliable Simanim on the body, e.g. he was tall or short;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not rely on Simanim on the clothes. We are concerned lest the deceased was wearing borrowed clothes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why do we return a donkey through Simanim on the saddle? Perhaps the saddle was borrowed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> People do not borrow saddles, for it wounds the donkey.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Indeed, we are never concerned for borrowing;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Mishnah teaches that we do not rely on unreliable Simanim on the clothes, e.g. they were black or red.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question (against Answer #1 - Beraisa):</span> If a Shali'ach lost a Get and found it tied to his moneybag or in his ring, or among his clothes, even after a long time, the Get is valid (we assume that it is the one he lost).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If we are concerned for borrowing, when it is tied to his wallet, why is it valid?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People do not lend these articles.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Lending a moneybag is a bad omen. One would not lend his signet ring, lest the borrower use it to forge.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not Simanim are mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not testify (to identify a corpse) based on birthmarks;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Elazar ben Mehavai permits.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The first Tana holds that Simanim are mid'Rabanan, and Elazar ben Mehavai holds that they are mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Rava):</span> All agree that Simanim are mid'Oraisa. They argue about whether or not we are concerned that someone with the same Mazal (configuration of the stars when he was born) has similar birthmarks.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say that this is common, so we are concerned. Elazar says that it is rare, so we are not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> All agree that it is rare that someone with the same Mazal has similar birthmarks;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about whether or not birthmarks are prone to change appearance after death.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say that they change. Elazar says that they do not change.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #3:</span> All agree that birthmarks are not prone to change appearance after death; and that Simanim are mid'Rabanan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about whether or not birthmarks are considered an infallible sign.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Elazar says that it is. Chachamim say that it is not.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHY THE ENACTMENT WAS MADE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If Simanim are mid'Rabanan, why was the enactment made?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> The finder is happy to return it through Simanim, so that when he loses something, he will get it back through Simanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Safra):</span> We are not concerned for the finder, rather for the owner!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The loser knows that he cannot bring witnesses, therefore he wants to be able to get it through Simanim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is confident that only he knows good Simanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Safra - Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> If Reuven borrowed from three people, we return the documents to him. If Shimon lent to three people, we return them to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The borrower does not want the lender to receive the documents through a Siman!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> That is based on logic, not on Simanim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When they are from the same borrower, surely he dropped them. Had they fallen from the lenders, there is no reason why they would be together;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When they are from the same lender, surely he dropped them. Had they fallen from the borrowers, there is no reason why they would be together.</p>
