<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO CONVERTS AMIDST A LOAN ON <i>RIBIS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Reuven borrowed money from a Nochri on Ribis. They calculated how much he owes (principal and Ribis combined), and wrote a document for this amount. The Nochri converted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he converted after they made the calculation, he collects it all;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he converted before they made the calculation, he collects only the principal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Similarly, if Reuven lent to a Nochri on Ribis, and they calculated how much he owes and wrote a document for this amount, and the Nochri converted:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he converted after they made the calculation, he pays it all;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he converted before they made the calculation, he pays only the principal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi says, if a Nochri borrowed, in either case he pays it all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> R. Yosi's law is an enactment, lest people say that he converted in order to be exempt from the Ribis.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MAY AN INVALID DOCUMENT BE USED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a document is for a loan on Ribis, we fine the lender, and he cannot use it to collect even principal;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, he can use it to collect principal, but not Ribis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir fines the permitted part due to the forbidden part. Chachamim do not fine the permitted part due to the forbidden part.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Predated loan documents are invalid. Postdated documents are valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are predated documents invalid?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, they may not be used to collect from the date written, but they should be valid to collect from the date of the loan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> Indeed, Chachamim say that they may be used to collect from the date of the loan. This Mishnah is R. Meir (who fines the permitted part due to the forbidden part).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> Chachamim admit in this case. It is a decree, lest he come to collect from the written date.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>A case occurred in which Shimon gave his orchard to Reuven to be collateral for a loan. Reuven ate the Peros for three years, and threatened 'if you do not sell it to me, I will conceal the document that says that it was collateral, and I will claim that I bought it.' (Eating three years is a Chazakah, so he would be believed.) Shimon transferred ownership of the orchard to his son (a minor), then Shimon sold it to Reuven. Clearly, the sale to Reuven is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is the money Reuven paid like a loan with a document (the Achrayus entitles him to collect from Meshubadim)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, is it like a Milveh Al Peh, which cannot be collected from Meshubadim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> We learn this from R. Asi's law!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">72b----------------------------------------72b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Asi):</span> If Levi admits that he authorized a document, Yehudah can use it against him, and Levi cannot demand that he validate it. (Shimon admits that Reuven paid for the orchard, like the document says. It is invalid to acquire the orchard, but it shows that Shimon owes him money!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> The case of the orchard is different, for there was no Heter to write the document!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> If so, why does R. Yochanan say that it is a <i>decree</i> not to collect from the latter date, lest he collect from the date written?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He should invalidate the document because there was no Heter to write it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mereimar):</span> A predated document had a Heter to be written, i.e. with the date of the loan. There was no Heter to write the document of the orchard at all!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Compensation for improvements: if Yehudah stole David's field and sold it to Levi, when David takes it back, Levi collects principal (what he paid) even from property that Yehudah sold, and improvements from Yehudah's Bnei Chorin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We should say that the document should never have been written, so it is invalid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One opinion holds that Yehudah does not want to be called a thief. The other opinion holds that he wants to act faithfully. Both agree that he will later buy the field from David to establish the document;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, Shimon wrote the document to prevent Reuven from keeping the field. Surely, he has no intent of fulfilling it!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CONTRACTING TO GIVE <i>PEROS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may not contract to supply Peros for a set price until there is a set price (in the market);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Once there is a set price, even someone without Peros may contract, since other people have available Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Reuven may contract (to supply the finished product) before there is a set price, if he already has a stack of grain, a container of grapes or olives, clay formed to make pots, or wood and stones that were put in the furnace to make plaster;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One may contract for manure all year round;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yosi permits only if he has a pile. Chachamim permit (in any case)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>He may contract at the cheap price;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yehudah says, even if he did not contract at the cheap price, he can demand the cheap price or his money back.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Asi citing R. Yochanan):</span> We may not contract according to the price in the market.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Did R. Yochanan say that even regarding a great market?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Asi):</span> No, he said so only regarding a market of medium size cities, for the price is unstable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Zeira thought that perhaps R. Yochanan meant even a great market - if so, how does he establish the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses when people open their storehouses to sell and ships arrive with grain, for then the price is stable for a long time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may not contract to supply Peros for a fixed price until there is a set price. Once there is a set price, even someone without Peros may contract, since other people have.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If new grain was selling for four (Sa'im for a Sela), and old (dry) grain for three, one may not contract (to buy new grain for four, since when he gets it, it will be dry. This is forbidden) until the prices equalize (at four).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Leket (dropped grain that is left for poor people to take, which is inferior) was selling for four (Se'im for a Sela), and regular grain for three, one may not contract to buy regular grain for four until that becomes the price.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> One may contract with one selling Leket according to the price for Leket.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Do you permit because the seller could borrow from another seller of Leket?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also a regular seller could borrow from a seller of Leket!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> A regular seller would not borrow from a seller of Leket (it is below his dignity).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> One who buys from a regular seller pays for higher quality grain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - (Rav Sheshes citing Rav Huna):</span> We may not borrow (money, on condition that if he does not repay regarding a fixed date, he will give Peros) based on the market price (of today, which is cheaper).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Bahag - (Rav Sheshes citing Rav Huna):</span> We may not borrow (a Se'ah on condition to return a Se'ah) even though there are Peros in the market. (One might have thought that since one can buy a Se'ah, it is as if the borrower has at home, in which case it is permitted.) (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef bar Chama):</span> That contradicts another teaching of Rav Huna!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May Talmidim borrow (Rashi - money; Bahag - Peros) in Tishrei and repay Peros in Teves (at the cheaper price of Teves)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> Yes. The money could be used now to buy Peros elsewhere (Rashi - where it is cheap).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Originally, Rav Huna ruled that it was forbidden, until he heard that R. Shmuel bar Chiya permits it.</p>
