<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW WE SPLIT THE DOCUMENT (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava said that they divide a golden garment. What would the halves be fit for?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>They are fit for children of kings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> If two were riding on an animal...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can they divide it? Regarding a Tahor animal, they can split the meat, but splitting a Tamei animal is a great loss!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that they split the value.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Likewise, they split the value of the document.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CAN ONE PICK UP A <i>METZI'AH</i> FOR ANOTHER?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> We learn from our Mishnah that if one picks up a Metzi'ah (something Hefker) to acquire for another, it works. If not, it would be as if each holds half, and the other half is on the ground (and he does not acquire! The Gemara will discuss which part of the Mishnah teaches this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Really, if one picks up an object to acquire for another, it does not work. Here, Migo (since) he can acquire for himself, he can acquire for another.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> If Reuven told a Shali'ach 'steal for me', Reuven is exempt, but partners who steal are liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The reason is, Migo (since) each can acquire for himself, he can acquire also for his partner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Since we say Migo, if a Cheresh (deaf-mute, who cannot acquire) and a Pike'ach (healthy person) lifted a Metzi'ah, since the Cheresh acquires, also the Pike'ach does.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We understand how the Cheresh acquires. (Chachamim enacted that he acquires what he finds, and) a Pike'ach lifts the other half for him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, how does the Pike'ach acquire?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, the Cheresh acquires, but the Pike'ach does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does this rely on Migo?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Migo that two Chereshim who picked up a Metzi'ah together would acquire, a Cheresh acquires also when he picks it up with a Pike'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Even if you will say that one can pick up a Metzi'ah to acquire for another, that is only if he intends for the other to acquire. Here, the Pike'ach wants to acquire for himself, but he does not acquire. Does he intend to acquire for someone else?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, since the Pike'ach does not acquire, the Cheresh does not, either.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different than two Chereshim that pick up together? They acquire!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is an enactment to avoid quarrels. Here, the Cheresh realizes that the Pike'ach does not acquire, so he does not expect that he should acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ada):</span> What was Rami bar Chama's source (that two people who pick up a Metzi'ah together acquire)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He learns from the Reisha, in which two are holding a garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There, each claims that he picked it up himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, it says 'Reuven says 'it is all mine.' Shimon says 'it is all mine.'' This is extra, to teach that one can pick up a Metzi'ah to acquire for another.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We established that 'I found it' discusses a Metzi'ah, and 'it is all mine' discusses a bought object.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he learns from the Seifa. Reuven says 'it is all mine.' Shimon says 'half is mine';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is extra, to teach that one can pick up an object to acquire for another.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps also the Seifa discusses a bought object, and not a Metzi'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what is the Chidush?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that since Shimon claims only half, he is like Meshiv Aveidah (one who returns a lost object), and he is exempt from swearing. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. Perhaps he schemes to avoid swearing. He knows that if he claims the entire object, he must swear, so he claims only half to be like Meshiv Aveidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, he learns from the third clause: if two people were riding...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is extra, to teach that one can pick up a Metzi'ah to acquire for another.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps this teaches that also riding acquires!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> Rather, he learns from the last clause: when they admit, or have witnesses, they divide without swearing'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it refers to a bought object, this is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it refers to a Metzi'ah (that they picked up together). It teaches that one can pick up an object to acquire for another.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>Rava holds that we cannot learn from here. Migo (since) he can acquire for himself, he can acquire for another.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ACQUIRING AN ANIMAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If both were riding...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Shmuel taught Rav Yehudah that riding <i>or</i> leading acquires, but the other does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yehudah):</span> Which one acquires?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If one person rides or leads alone, would anyone say that leading does not acquire?! Surely, he would know that leading acquires!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Shmuel discusses leading while another is riding. Rav Yehudah was unsure if riding is better, for he holds the animal himself (Rashi; Tosfos - he holds the halter);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or, perhaps leading is better, for he causes the animal to go.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Rav Yehudah - Mishnah):</span> If one is leading two different species of animals pulling a wagon, and one sits in the wagon, both are lashed (for working with Kil'ayim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir exempts the one in the wagon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> The opinions must be switched. Chachamim exempt the one in the wagon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference (Rav Yehudah):</span> Shmuel holds that riding alone does not acquire, and all the more so riding when another is leading.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> How can you learn about riding from sitting in a wagon? One who sits does not hold the Mosirah (halter)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> Both Rav and Shmuel say that holding the halter does not acquire a Hefker animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Rav Yosef resolved from the Mishnah, like above.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> How can you learn about riding from sitting in a wagon? One who sits does not hold the halter!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Idi recited a Beraisa that says that holding the halter does not acquire a Hefker animal. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chelbo):</span> Taking the halter from the seller acquires, but this does not acquire a Hefker animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the significance of the word 'Mosirah'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Idi):</span> This is like one who is Moser (hands over) something to another person.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This applies to buying, but no one gives over Hefker!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If both were riding on an animal...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is R. Meir (according to Shmuel, who switched the opinions in the above Mishnah).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He holds that even sitting in the wagon acquires! (He would not need to teach an extra clause here to teach that riding acquires.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is Chachamim. This shows that riding acquires!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses one who conducts it with his legs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Reisha says that one was riding and one was leading. (If he conducts with his legs, both lead it!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses two kinds of leading.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that riding is better, because he both leads and holds the animal. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
