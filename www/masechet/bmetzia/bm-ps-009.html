<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DOES RIDING ACQUIRE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Support (Beraisa):</span> If two people were pulling a camel or leading a donkey, or one was pulling and one was leading, in this way, they acquire;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, only Meshichah (pulling) acquires a camel, only leading acquires a donkey.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> The Beraisa mentions pulling and leading, but not riding. (This shows that riding does not acquire!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, also riding acquires. It mentions only pulling and leading, for the Tana'im argue about these. The first Tana says that either animal is acquired through either of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the Beraisa should teach them together! If two people were pulling or riding, whether a camel or donkey...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One of the two methods does not acquire one of the two animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some say that pulling does not acquire a donkey. Others say that leading does not acquire a camel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Support (Seifa):</span> ... In this way, they acquire. (Usually, 'Mosiv' is a question, but here it is not - Rivan, in Shitah Mekubetzes.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It excludes riding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it excludes pulling a donkey or leading a camel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is R. Yehudah's opinion!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first Tana holds that one of these (pulling a donkey, or leading a camel) acquires. R. Yehudah holds that neither acquires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven was riding a donkey; and Shimon was holding the halter, Reuven acquires the donkey, Shimon acquires the halter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that riding acquires!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here also, he conducts it with his legs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he should also acquire the halter!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Indeed, (the Beraisa means that) Reuven acquires the donkey and half the halter, and Shimon acquires half the halter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Granted, Reuven acquires half the halter, for (it is like part of the donkey, and) also the other half is held by one who is able to acquire (Shimon);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, Shimon holds only half (and the donkey holds up the other half). How can he acquire?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Indeed, Reuven acquires the donkey and the entire halter, except for the part in Shimon's hand, which Shimon acquires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Even if you will say that if Levi lifts a Metzi'ah for Yehudah to acquire, Yehudah acquires, that is only if Levi intends for Yehudah to acquire;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, Shimon holds the halter only to acquire it himself. If he does not acquire (any part of what is outside his hand), will Reuven acquire through Shimon's holding?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> Indeed, Reuven acquires the donkey and the part of the halter in the donkey's mouth. Shimon acquires the part he holds. Neither acquires the rest of the halter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Avahu):</span> The Beraisa is like the simple meaning. Shimon acquires the entire halter; because he could yank it and it would come to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is wrong!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it were true, if a garment were half on the floor and half on a post, and David picked up the part on the floor, and then Moshe picked up the part on the post, would David acquire it all, because he could yank it?! (When two pick up a Metzi'ah, we do not distinguish whether one end was higher than the other!)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ABNORMAL ACQUISITION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Riding in a field or leading in a city acquires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There also, he conducts with his legs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If so, that is also leading!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses two kinds of leading.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If so, why doesn't riding in a city acquire?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Kahana):</span> It is abnormal to ride in the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection: (Rav Ashi):</span> If so, one who picks up a wallet on Shabbos does not acquire, for it is abnormal to do so!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>That is not so. What he did, he did (and he acquires). The same applies here!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The Beraisa discusses buying. The case is, the seller told him to acquire like people normally do.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">9b----------------------------------------9b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>In the following cases, it is normal to ride, and he would acquire:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is on a public road (in the city), he is a distinguished person (it does not befit him to lead it), the buyer is a woman (she is too weak to lead it), he is lowly (he rides anywhere. Average people prefer to lead it, for riding is immodest.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'Meshoch (take to your Reshus) this animal (with intent) to acquire the Kelim on it', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Reuven did not say that he transfers ownership! (His words suggest only that Shimon should intend to acquire.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if he said 'Meshoch this animal and acquire the Kelim on it', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Does pulling the animal acquire the Kelim? (The Gemara never answers the question.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> R. Elazar asked only about acquiring only the Kelim. This implies that had he said 'acquire the animal and acquire the Kelim', he would acquire;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An animal is (like) a moving Chatzer, which is invalid for Kinyan Chatzer</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the case is that the animal stood still!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Anything that does not acquire if it moves, it does not acquire if it stands still.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the animal was tied up and could not move.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rava - Rav Papa and Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> If fish jumped into a ship, would you say that the ship does not acquire them because it is a moving Chatzer?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The ship is not a moving Chatzer. It stands still, and the water moves it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> If a woman was walking in the Reshus ha'Rabim, and her husband threw a Get in her garment or basket, would she not be divorced?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The basket stands still, and she moves it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TAKING <i>PE'AH</i> FOR AN <i>ANI</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was riding on an animal and saw a Metzi'ah, and told Shimon 'give it to me':</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon took it and said 'I acquired it myself', he acquired it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said this after giving it to Reuven, Reuven acquired.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If Levi gathered Pe'ah and said 'this is for Ploni the Oni', he acquired for him;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, he must give it to the first poor person he finds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> They argue about when Levi himself is rich:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer holds that Migo (since) if Levi would make his property Hefker, Pe'ah would be fitting for him (to take), even when he is rich, it is fitting for him;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Migo he could acquire it for himself, he may acquire it for an Oni.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim hold that we may use only one Migo.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>All agree that an Oni may acquire for another Oni. Migo he could acquire it for himself, he may acquire it for another.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> Rather, you should say that they argue about when Levi is poor!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Everyone is like an Oni regarding a Metzi'ah (he may take it). In our Mishnah, if Reuven told Shimon 'Give it to me' and Shimon says that he took it for himself, he acquires it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Granted, if they argue about an Oni, our Mishnah is Chachamim (therefore, Reuven does not acquire);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>But if all agree that an Oni can acquire for another Oni, our Mishnah is not like either Tana!</p>
