<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LIMITATIONS OF THE <i>MITZVAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "Rovetz (crouching)" - not an animal that always crouches, nor an animal standing under its load;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Tachas Masa'o" refers to a load that it can stand under. Also, this excludes an unloaded animal (that must be loaded again).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If pain to animals is mid'Oraisa, he should be obligated even if it always crouches or is standing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana is R. Yosi ha'Glili, who says that pain to animals is mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> The Beraisa says that "Tachas Masa'o" refers to a load that it can stand under. We know that R. Yosi ha'Glili expounds this way!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa cannot be R. Yosi ha'Glili!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> "Tachas Masa'o" excludes an unloaded animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot mean that there is no Mitzvah to load an unloaded animal. It says "Hakim Takim"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, there is no Mitzvah to load it for free, only for pay. This is like Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, the Tana is R. Yosi. Regarding loading, he agrees with Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Ki Sir'eh" means when you will see, even from afar!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ki Sifga (when you will encounter)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Ki Sifga" means literally, when you will encounter (come close (Levush), i.e. within four Amos (Chidushei R. Yehonasan))!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Ki Sir'eh."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We fulfill both verses through seeing that is like encountering. Chachamim estimated, when it is one Ris (seven and a half Ris equals one Mil) away.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He walks with it for four Mil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> This is for pay.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SPECIAL LAWS OF ONE'S <i>REBBI</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven's own Aveidah takes precedence over that of his father or Rebbi;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>His Rebbi's Aveidah takes precedence over his father's.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because his father brought him to this world, but his Rebbi, who taught him Chachmah, brings him to life in the world to come;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If his father is a Chacham, his father's takes precedence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If his father and Rebbi were carrying burdens, he helps his Rebbi unload, and then his father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If his father and Rebbi were imprisoned, first he redeems his Rebbi, and then his father;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If his father is a Chacham, he redeems his father first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source (that his own Aveidah takes precedence)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> "Lo Yihyeh Becha Evyon" - do not make yourself poor (by abandoning your own Aveidah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Anyone who is zealous to give precedence to his own Aveidah (he never goes beyond the letter of the law) will ultimately become poor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If his father and Rebbi were carrying burdens, he helps his Rebbi unload, and then his father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> The Mishnah discusses his Rebbi who taught to him Chachmah (the reasons behind the Mishnayos and how to resolve difficulties), not the Rebbi who taught to him written Torah or the text of the Mishnayos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Yehudah says, it is whomever he learned most of his Chachmah from;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Yosi says, even if he explained only one Mishnah to him, he is considered his Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> This is like Rav Sechorah, who explained to us 'Zuhama Listron' (a ladle to push aside the froth).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>A Chacham explained to Shmuel one part of a Mishnah about opening the Mikdash.. Shmuel tore his clothing (like one does for his Rebbi) when the Chacham died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Chachamim in Bavel rise for each other and tear clothing over each other;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding an Aveidah, they give precedence (over their fathers) only to their primary Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda):</span> If the Rebbi needs a Talmid (to hear what the Talmid learned from others), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> I don't need you. You need me!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They were upset with each other, and did not see each other for 40 years. Rav Chisda fasted 40 days for having pained his Rebbi. Rav Huna fasted 40 days for having suspected that Rav Chisda asked about himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Yosef citing R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Rav Huna):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did R. Yochanan really rule like R. Yehudah? R. Yochanan taught that the Halachah follows an anonymous Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ...His Rebbi that taught him Chachmah... (this is like R. Meir)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means 'that taught him most of his Chachmah.' It is like R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT TO LEARN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Learning oral Torah is good, but it is not best.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Learning Mishnah is good, and one is rewarded for it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Learning Gemara is the greatest;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One should run to learn Mishnah more than Gemara.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Gemara is greatest, why should one run to learn Mishnah more than Gemara?!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">33b----------------------------------------33b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> In Rebbi's day, they taught that Gemara is greatest. Everyone abandoned Mishnah and engaged only in Gemara;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There was danger lest the Mishnah be forgotten. Therefore, Rebbi taught that learning Mishnah takes precedence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the source to say that Gemara is greatest?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah):</span> "Haged l'Ami Pish'am (tell to My nation their transgression)" refers to Chachamim. Their Shegagos (mistaken rulings due to not understanding the reasons behind the Mishnayos) are considered like Mezid sins;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Ul'Veis Yakov Chatosam" refers to ignoramuses. Their Mezid sins are considered Shogeg.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> Be careful in your learning. One is punished for an oversight in learning as for a Mezid sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Ha'Charedim El Devaro (those diligent to His word)" are Chachamim. "Acheichem" are people who learn only oral Torah. "Sone'eichem" are people who only learn Mishnah (they are unqualified to decide Halachah, but do so anyway). Menadeichem" are ignoramuses (Chachamim shun them like Nidos).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Nireh v'Simchaschem" - we will all rejoice.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"V'Hem Yevoshu" - Nochrim will be embarrassed, but Yisrael will rejoice.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK HA'MAFKID</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A <i>SHOMER</i> CAN GET <i>KEFEL</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven deposited with Shimon (a Shomer Chinam) an animal or Kelim, and they were stolen or lost, Shimon could swear (that he was not negligent) and be exempt. If he paid and did not want to swear, and the thief was found, the thief pays Kefel (double, or four or five if a Kosher Behemah was slaughtered or sold) to Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon swore and did not want to pay, payments of Kefel, four or five go to Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why must the Mishnah list both an animal and Kelim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must teach both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only about an animal, one might have thought that only regarding an animal Reuven allows Shimon to acquire the (deposit, in order that he will acquire the) Kefel, for guarding an animal is a burden, but if he guarded Kelim, Reuven gets it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only about Kelim, one might have thought that Reuven allows Shimon to acquire, because the fine is only Kefel, it is never more, but the payment for an animal can be four or five, and he would not allow Shimon to acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> A man cannot transfer ownership of something that is not yet in the world (i.e. Kefel)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even according to the opinion that a man can transfer ownership of something not yet in the world, that is only in cases such as fruits that will grow on a date tree, for they normally come. Here, who says that the deposit will be stolen?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>And even if it is stolen, who says that the thief will be found? And even if he is found, perhaps he will admit, and not pay the fine!</p>
