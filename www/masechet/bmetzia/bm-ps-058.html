<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SWEARING ABOUT <i>SHEKALIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Shomer Chinam does not swear...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> if people of a city made Sheluchim to take their (half-)Shekalim to the Mikdash, they were stolen or lost:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they were stolen or lost (Tosfos; Rashi - if they were taken to Beis Din) after the Terumah was taken (i.e. some of the Shekalim in the chamber in the Mikdash were taken to buy the communal Korbanos from Nisan until Shavuos), the Sheluchim swear to the Gizbarim. (We will explain that the Terumah 'covers' Shekalim en route to the Mikdash, therefore, the people of the city need not send more. This contradicts our Mishnah, which exempts a Shomer Chinam from swearing!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If not ((Rashi - the Gizbar found out that) they were lost before Terumah was taken), the Sheluchim swear to the people of the city (and they must send more Shekalim).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the coins were found or the thieves returned them, both those Shekalim and the replacements have the Kedushah of Shekalim (they can be used for communal Korbanos). The people of the city are not exempt from giving Shekalim the next year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> The case is, the Sheluchim were hired. They must swear in order to receive their wages.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, (also in the Reisha) they should swear to the people of the city (who hired them)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> (In the Reisha,)They swear to the people of the city when the Gizbarim are present, to avoid suspicion, or so people will not think they were negligent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Shomer Sachar is liable for theft or loss!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Granted, regarding Hekdesh they are exempt, but they should not be paid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> It was Ones. Armed robbers stole them, or they were lost on a boat that sank.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> The Mishnah is R. Shimon, who says that Ona'ah applies to Kodshim that have Achrayus. Likewise, a Shomer Chinam swears about them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Granted, if they were lost before Terumah was taken, there is Achrayus (more Shekalim must be given in place of them);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, if they were lost after Terumah was taken, there is no Achrayus. Why do the Sheluchim swear?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Those who take the Terumah intend that these are Terumah (also) from: Shekalim that were sent and (unknowingly) lost, Shekalim that are en route to the Mikdash; and Shekalim that will later be given. (Anyone who gave such a (half-)Shekel has a share in the Korbanos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Elazar):</span> The oath is mid'Rabanan, lest people treat Hekdesh lightly.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SHOMRIM OF HEKDESH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Shomer Sachar need not pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rav Yosef bar Chama - Beraisa):</span> If Hekdesh hired Reuven (for a certain wage each day) to guard a red heifer, a child or crops, he is not paid for Shabbos, therefore, he is not responsible for what happens on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was hired for the week, month, year or Shemitah cycle, he is paid for (the whole period, including) Shabbos, therefore, he is responsible for Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means that he must compensate for any losses on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> No, it means that if a loss occurs on Shabbos, he is not paid for Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> The Reisha taught that he is not responsible for Shabbos. This cannot mean to lose his wages, for he is not paid for Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> I cannot answer. Did you hear an answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef citing Rav Sheshes; also, R. Yochanan):</span> The case is, he made an acquisition obligating himself to pay if there will be a loss.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> Ona'ah applies to Kodshim that have Achrayus, but not to Kodshim without Achrayus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(A Tana (one who recites Beraisos)):</span> (If one swore falsely about) Kodshim that have Achrayus, he is liable, for this is considered "ba'Shem v'Chichesh";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>He is exempt for Kodshim without Achrayus, for this is considered "v'Chichesh b'Amiso."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yitzchak bar Aba):</span> Just the contrary! (One is less liable for Hekdesh than for property of people.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">58b----------------------------------------58b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">The Tana:</span> I will no longer recite the Beraisa (there is a mistake in the text).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">R. Yitzchak:</span> It is not mistaken. It means like this: one is liable for Kodshim with Achrayus, for this is included from "ba'Shem v'Chichesh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is exempt for Kodshim without Achrayus. This is excluded from "v'Chichesh b'Amiso."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THINGS TO WHICH ONA'AH DOES NOT APPLY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> Ona'ah does not apply to a Sefer Torah, animal or pearl.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Ona'ah does not apply to a Sefer Torah, because it is priceless. It does not apply to an animal or pearl, because people want (and willingly pay extra for) a good match of animals or pearls;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> People want a good match for everything!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> These are more important to people than everything else.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Up to how much is there no Ona'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> It is until double their value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah ben Beseira):</span> Also if one sells a horse, sword or shield in wartime, Ona'ah does not apply, for one's life depends on them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>VERBAL AFFLICTION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Just like Ona'ah in a sale is forbidden, also verbal Ona'ah (affliction) is forbidden:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may not ask the price of an item if he does not intend to buy it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One may not say to a sinner who repented 'remember your prior deeds!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One may not say to a convert's son 'remember your ancestors' deeds!', for it says "v'Ger Lo Soneh v'Lo Silchatzenu."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "Lo Sonu Ish Es Amiso" forbids verbal Ona'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it forbids Ona'ah in a sale!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Chi Timkeru Memkar..." discusses Ona'ah in a sale.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One may not say to a sinner who repented 'remember your prior deeds!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>One may not say to a convert's son 'remember your ancestors' deeds!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>One may not say to a convert who wants to learn 'your mouth ate forbidden foods. Will it learn Torah, which was given from Hash-m?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>One may not speak to one suffering afflictions (or sickness or whose children died) the way Iyov's friends spoke to him - "Mi Hu Naki Ovad".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If donkey-drivers ask one for grain, he may not direct them to one whom he knows does not sell;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yehudah says, one may not ask about buying something if he lacks money to buy it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One himself knows whether he intends to pain another. Regarding all such matters, it says "v'Yareisa me'Elokecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Verbal Ona'ah is worse than deceit in a sale. It says "v'Yareisa me'Elokecha" regarding the former, but not regarding the latter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Verbal Ona'ah is worse, for it afflicts the person himself, not just his property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> Verbal Ona'ah is worse, for it cannot be returned (undone).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(A reciter of Beraisos):</span> If one whitens a person's face (makes him blush), this is like bloodshed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Yes! Afterwards, the redness fades and the face turns white again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> What are people careful about in Eretz Yisrael?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> They are careful not to make people blush.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> Everyone goes to Gehinom, except for three...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> This cannot be!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, everyone who goes to Gehinom leaves, except for three: one who has Bi'ah with another man's wife, one who makes someone blush, and one who coins a derogatory nickname for someone.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Giving a bad nickname is included in making him blush!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the person is already used to the name, he does not blush. (Even so,  he does not leave Gehinom. Kesef Mishneh (Hilchos Teshuvah 3:14) - this includes one who calls him by a name that someone else gave to him.)</p>
