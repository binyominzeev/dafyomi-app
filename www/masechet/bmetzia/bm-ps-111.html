<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN ONE TRANSGRESSES <i>BAL TALIN</i> FOR WITHHOLDING WAGES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'hire workers for me', neither transgresses "Lo Salin";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven does not transgress, for he did not hire them. Shimon does not transgress, for they do not work for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon said 'it is my responsibility to pay you', he must pay them!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Levi hired David to work for himself, and set him to work on what is really Yehudah's property, Levi pays David, and can demand that Yehudah pay him the benefit he received.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Shimon said 'Reuven will pay you'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Yehudah bar Mereimar told his servant 'hire workers, and tell them that I will pay them.'  (This way, no one will transgress "Lo Salin.")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Mereimar and Mar Zutra would hire workers on behalf of each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> People of Sura (who hire workers and are unable to pay them until the market day) do not transgress "Lo Salin." The workers know that they will not be paid before this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the employer does not pay on the market day, he transgresses 'Bal Tishaheh'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Sechir Sha'os (one hired by the hour) must be paid that night or day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> A Sechir Sha'os for the day (Rashi - to work in the morning) must be paid that day. If he was hired to work at night, he must be paid that night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If he was hired for the day, he must be paid that day. If he was hired for the night, he must be paid that night or the coming day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Mishnah):</span> A Sechir Sha'os must be paid that night or day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> The Mishnah puts together the laws of two different cases;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was hired for the day, he must be paid that day. If he was hired for the night, he must be paid that night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Mishnah):</span> If one hired for a week, month, year or Shemitah cycle ends working during the day, he must be paid that day. If he ends working at night, he must be paid that night or the coming day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Tana'im argue about this. (I rule like R. Yehudah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If he was hired (by the hour and worked) during the day, he must be paid that day. If he worked at night, he must be paid that night;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, if he worked during the day, he must be paid that day. If he worked at night, he must be paid that night or the coming day.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Anyone who withholds wages transgresses five Lavim and an Aseh - "Lo Sa'ashok Es Re'acha", "v'Lo Sigzol", "Lo Sa'ashok Sachir Oni", "Lo Salin", "v'Lo Savo Alav ha'Shemesh" and the Aseh "b'Yomo Siten Secharo."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can one transgress them all? Some of these apply only during the day, and others apply only at night!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> The Tana means that there are five Lavim and an Aseh that forbid withholding wages.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OSHEK AND GEZEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between 'Oshek' (withholding wages) and theft?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> If he keeps saying 'go, come back later', this is Oshek. If he says 'I have your wages, but I will not pay you', this is theft.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Sheshes):</span> The Oshek for which one brings a Korban is similar to the case of a deposit, i.e. he denies owing (and falsely swears and then admits).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> If he says 'I already paid you', this is Oshek. If he says 'I have your wages, but I will not pay you', this is theft.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> The theft for which one brings a Korban is similar to the case of a deposit, i.e. he denies owing (and falsely swears and then admits).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Abaye):</span> If he says 'I never hired you', this is Oshek. If he says 'I already paid you', this is theft.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Rav Sheshes challenge Rav Chisda only regarding Oshek, but not regarding theft?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps Rav Chisda meant that outside of Beis Din the thief said 'I will not return to you', and in Beis Din, he denied stealing (and swore falsely).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we can similarly defend Rav Chisda regarding Oshek! (Outside of Beis Din he said 'go, come back later.' In Beis Din, he denied owing.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Regarding theft it says "(and he denied...) Oh b'Gezel", (even if he denied only now, but beforehand he did not deny);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Had it said 'Oh b'Oshek', we would say the same about Oshek (even if he denied owing wages only now, but beforehand he did not deny);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Rather, it says "Oh Oshak", which connotes that he denied owing wages from the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rava):</span> Oshek and theft are the same;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah gives it another name to obligate one who transgresses with an extra Lav.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FOR WHICH WAGES DOES ONE TRANSGRESS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who withholds wages of a worker or rental of an animal or Kelim transgresses "b'Yomo Siten Secharo" and "Lo Salin Pe'ulas Sachir Itecha Ad Boker";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is when the worker asked for his wages. If not, the employer does not transgress.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He does not transgress if he arranged with a grocer or moneychanger to pay the worker (and the employer will reimburse him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>In the time a worker should be paid (if he argues with his employer about whether he was paid), he swears and collects;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After the time he should be paid, he does not swear and collect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If witnesses saw the worker demand his wages (before the due time, and he was not paid), he swears and collects (after the time).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>"B'Yomo Siten Secharo" applies to one who hires a Ger Toshav, but not "Lo Salin Pe'ulas Sachir Itecha Ad Boker";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah? It is not the first Tana of the Beraisa of 'Achicha', nor R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">111b----------------------------------------111b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "(Do not withhold wages of a poor worker) me'Achicha" excludes Nochrim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Mi'Gerecha" refers to a convert;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Bi'Sh'arecha" refers to a Ger (Toshav) who may eat Neveilos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to include rental of an animal or Kelim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "B'Artzecha" includes anything in your land.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>All the Lavim and the Aseh apply to wages (or rental) of a Yisrael, convert, Ger Toshav, an animal or Kelim - "b'Yomo Siten Secharo" (and the Lavim before and after it) and "Lo Salin Pe'ulas Sachir" (and the other Lavin in that verse).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, "b'Yomo Siten Secharo" applies to a Ger Toshav, but "Lo Salin" does not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Only "Lo Sa'ashok" applies to rental of an animal or Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Recap of question:</span> Our Tana is not the first Tana, nor R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is not the first Tana, for he says that all the Lavim apply to a Ger Toshav!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It is not R. Yosi, for he says that only "Lo Sa'ashok" applies to rental of an animal or Kelim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Our Tana is Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> One who withholds wages of a worker or rental of an animal or Kelim transgresses "b'Yomo Siten Secharo" and "Lo Salin Pe'ulas Sachir Itecha Ad Boker";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"B'Yomo Siten Secharo" applies to a Ger Toshav, but "Lo Salin" does not.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>HOW THE <i>TANA'IM</i> LEARN THE VERSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the first Tana of the Beraisa of ''Achicha" learn?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from a Gezeirah Shavah "Sachir-Sachir" (just like "Lo Sa'ashok" (and the adjacent Mitzvos) apply to a Ger Toshav, also "Lo Salin" and the other Mitzvos in that verse);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah does not learn from the Gezeirah Shavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even so, he should say that "b'Yomo Siten Secharo" applies to rental of an animal or Kelim (this is written after "b'Artzecha", which teaches that one transgresses for them)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chananya):</span> "V'Lo Savo Alav ha'Shemesh Ki Oni Hu" - the Mitzvos of this verse only apply to people, who can become poor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does the first Tana learn from "Ki Oni Hu"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the employer does not have enough to pay all his workers, he should first pay poor workers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah learns that from "Lo Sa'ashok Sachir Oni v'Evyon".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>The first Tana needs one verse to teach that we pay a poor worker before a rich one, and another verse to teach that we pay a poor worker before a destitute one. The Torah needed to teach both of these;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Had it taught only that we pay a poor worker before a destitute one, one might have thought that this is because a destitute worker does not let shame stop him from asking for his wages, but rich and poor workers both are embarrassed to ask for their wages, so neither has precedence over the other;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Had it taught only that we pay a poor worker before a rich one, one might have thought that this is because a rich worker does not need the money so badly, and since a destitute worker needs the money more than a poor worker, he would be paid first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does our Tana learn?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he learns the Gezeirah Shavah "Sachir-Sachir", all the Mitzvos should apply to a Ger Toshav!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he does not learn the Gezeirah Shavah, how does he know that all the Mitzvos apply to rental of an animal or Kelim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, he does not learn the Gezeirah Shavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Lo Salin Pe'ulas Sachir Itecha Ad Boker" includes all cases when work was done for you (and you did not yet pay for it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, this should include wages of a Ger Toshav!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Re'acha" excludes a Ger Toshav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This should also exclude rental of an animal or Kelim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Itecha" includes them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we include animals and Kelim, and exclude a Ger Toshav, and not vice-versa?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Presumably we include animals and Kelim, for these are the money of "Re'acha".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does the first Tana of the Beraisa learn from "Re'acha"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Re'acha" excludes an Amaleki (or any Nochri).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Achicha" excludes an Amaleki!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One verse permits withholding his wages, and the other permits stealing from him. (The Halachah does not follow this opinion.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah must teach both.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it permitted only stealing from him, one might have thought that this is because he did not work for it, but one may not withhold his wages;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Had it permitted only withholding his wages, one might have thought that this is because he never received the money, but one may not steal his money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah learn from "Lo Salin Pe'ulas Sachir Itecha Ad Boker"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns Rav Asi's law (as follows).</p>
