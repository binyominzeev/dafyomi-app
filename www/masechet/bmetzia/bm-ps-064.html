<p class="dedicationbox"><br>PAST DEDICATION<br>BAVA METZIA 64 (6 Tamuz) - In loving memory of David Mizrahi (David ben Adele), whose warmth and kindness made him loved by all. Your memory is with us always. By his brother in law, Michael M. Missry. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO RECEIVED TOO MUCH MONEY (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> If Shimon never gives gifts, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> We assume that he stole from Reuven, and wants to return the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one stole money and returned it by giving too much money in a subsequent transaction with the victim, he fulfilled returning it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> If Shimon came from abroad and had no previous dealings with Reuven, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> We assume that someone else stole from Reuven, and asked Shimon to return the money in this way.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BUYING FUTURE GROWTH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> I heard Rav saying 'Kari, Kari.' What was he saying?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabanan):</span> If Reuven gave a gardener (Shimon) money for Kari (gourds) the size of a pinky, and Shimon stipulated to give (later) gourds the size of the middle finger, this is permitted only if Shimon has gourds now.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that since they grow by themselves, this is permitted even if he has none now. Rav teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This is like the following Tana.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven was going to milk his goats, shear his sheep or take the honey from his hive, and he sold to Shimon 'whatever I will milk, shear or extract', this is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he stipulated how much this will be, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Even though they will produce more milk, wool or honey by themselves, it is forbidden, since it is not there now.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A gardener may stipulate to give (later) bigger gourds even if he has no gourds now, since they grow by themselves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa forbids this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, the milk (or wool or honey) does not grow out of the milk that is here now (rather, from the seller's goat, so it is like Ribis);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, the buyer buys small gourds now. His own gourds grow bigger. A proof of this is that when the gourds are uprooted, nothing grows by itself in their place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Reuven may pay Shimon for a barrel of wine, on condition that if it spoils, Shimon suffers the loss, and if the price changes, Reuven gains or loses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sharbiya):</span> Reuven is closer to gain than to lose! (This is forbidden due to Ribis.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">64b----------------------------------------64b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Since he accepted the loss if the price declines, he is prone to gain or lose, so it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BENEFIT FROM THE BORROWER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven lent money to Shimon, he may not dwell in Shimon's yard for free, nor rent from Shimon for less than the norm, for this is Ribis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Gemara - Rav Yosef bar Minyomi):</span> Even though one who lives in Ploni's yard without Ploni's knowledge need not pay him, if he lent Ploni money, he must pay him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that this applies only to a yard normally rented out and a man who normally rents a place to stay, but if the yard is not normally rented out and the man does not normally rent a place to stay, it is permitted. Rav Yosef teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Yosef bar Minyomi):</span> Even though if Reuven lives in Ploni's yard without Ploni's knowledge, Reuven need not pay him, if Ploni told him 'lend to me money and live in my yard', Reuven must pay him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Version #1 forbids living for free even if Ploni did not suggest the deal, and all the more so, if Ploni suggested it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Version #2 forbids living for free only if Ploni suggested the deal. If not, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since Ploni never suggested it, Reuven did not lend in order to live in his yard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>People of Rav Yosef bar Chama's household would take slaves (of people who owed to them money) and work with them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava (his son):</span> Why do you do this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Rav Nachman taught that a slave is not worth the food he eats. (I feed them when I use them. I benefit the owners!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Rav Nachman said that only about his own slave Dari, who dances in bars to get drinks. Normal slaves work!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I hold like Rav Daniel citing Rav, who said that if Reuven grabbed Shimon's slave and used the slave, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Shimon is happy that people use his slaves!</p>
<p class="bas normal"></p>
