<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THINGS FOUND IN A WALL (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If something was found in a new wall, if it was closer to Reshus ha'Rabim, the finder keeps it. If it was closer to Reuven' premises, Reuven gets it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> If a knife is found, we assume that it was inserted from the direction the handle faces. (The finder keeps it only if the handle faced Reshus ha'Rabim.) We assume that a drawstring bag was inserted from the direction that the strings face.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that it depends on which half of the wall it is in!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses things held from either side, like tufts of wool or pieces of silver.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the Aveidah spans the entire width of the wall, the finder divides it with the owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the (hole in the) wall slopes. One might have thought that we assume that the Aveidah was put on the higher side and slid down. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FROM WHOM IS THE <i>AVEIDAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven rented his house to others, one may keep what he finds even in the house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should assume that it belongs to the last tenants!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If coins were found (in Yerushalayim) in front of people who sell animals, we always assume that the coins were used to redeem Ma'aser Sheni. (One must spend such coins on food and eat it in Yerushalayim. Most such coins are spent to buy Korbanos Shelamim.) Coins found in Har ha'Bayis are (assumed to be) Chulin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In other markets in Yerushalayim, during the festivals (when all Yisrael come to Yerushalayim with Ma'aser coins), they are Ma'aser. At any other time, they are Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shemayah ben Ze'ira):</span> This is because the markets of Yerushalayim are swept daily. (Surely, the coins were dropped the day they were found. Har ha'Bayis is not swept, so we follow the majority usage.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Similarly, (had the Aveidah been left by prior tenants, the next tenant would have found it. We should assume that) what was found now was left by the last tenant!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> The case is, the house was rented to three (people, even) Yisre'elim. The loser surely despaired.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This shows that the Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Elazar (who permits keeping an Aveidah found in a public place, because the loser despairs) even when most of the city are Yisre'elim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (and Answer #2 - Rav Menasya bar Yakov):</span> The house was rented to three Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> Even if it was rented to three Yisre'elim, perhaps the Halachah does not follow R. Shimon. Here, the loser despairs, for he is sure that one of the other two took it, and they deny it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>This is like Rav Nachman taught elsewhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If two people were standing together and Levi saw a coin fall from one of them, he must return it;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">26b----------------------------------------26b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The loser does not despair. He is sure that his companion took it, and he plans to confront him and get it back.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If three people were standing together; and Levi saw a coin fall from one of them, he may keep it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The loser despairs, for (he is sure that one of the other two took it, and) whoever he confronts can deny that he found it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rava):</span> If the Aveidah (that fell from one of three people) is worth at least three Perutos, he must return it. Perhaps they are partners (and each owns at least a Perutah), and they do not despair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rava):</span> If the Aveidah is worth at least two Perutos, he must return it. Perhaps they were all partners, and one of them pardoned his share to the others.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE <i>MITZVOS</i> INVOLVED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven saw a coin fall from Shimon, and he picked it up before Shimon despaired, intending to steal it, he transgresses all of the following: "Lo Sigzol", "Hashev Teshivem", and "Lo Suchal Lehis'alem";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if he returns it after Shimon despaired, this is only a gift. It does not correct his transgressions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he picked it up before Shimon despaired, intending to return it, and after Shimon despaired, he intended to steal it, he transgresses "Hashev Teshivem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he waited to pick it up until Shimon despaired, he transgresses only "Lo Suchal Lehis'alem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven saw a coin fall from Shimon and fall in sand, if Reuven picked it up, he need not return it, for Shimon despaired.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if Shimon takes a sifter and sifts the sand, he despaired from his coin. He is trying to find what others have lost.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MONEY FOUND IN A STORE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven found something (without a Siman) in Shimon's store, Reuven keeps it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he found it between Shimon's box (where he puts the money) and Shimon, it is Shimon's.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven found money in front of the table of a moneychanger (Levi), Reuven keeps it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he found it between the chair (on which the table rests) and Levi, it is Levi's.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Shimon sold or sent Peros to Reuven, and there were coins inside, Reuven keeps them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the coins were wrapped up, he announces (to return them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Elazar):</span> (Reuven may keep) even money on the table.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Reuven may keep money found in front of the table;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He may not keep money on the table!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Mishnah):</span> Money found between the chair and Levi, it is Levi's.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Reuven may keep money on the table!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The inferences contradict one another. We cannot determine which is correct. The Mishnah neither supports nor refutes R. Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Elazar's source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> He had difficulty with the Mishnah. Rather than teaching that money between the chair and Levi is Levi's, it should have taught that money on the table is Levi's!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Alternatively, it could have said that Reuven keeps what he finds in a moneychanger's store, like the Reisha, which says 'Reuven may keep something he found in Shimon's store';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since it did not say either of these, we must say that Reuven keeps it.</p>
