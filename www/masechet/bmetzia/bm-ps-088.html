<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>BEING <i>KOVE'A</i> FOR <i>MA'ASER</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> There is no obligation to tithe Peros unless they entered through the door of the house - "Bi'arti ha'Kodesh Min ha'Bayis";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even entering a Chatzer is <i>Kove'a</i> Peros for Ma'aser (forbids eating them casually before tithing) - "v'Achlu vi'Sh'arecha"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yochanan learn from "Min ha'Bayis"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that a Chatzer is Kove'a only if it resembles a house, i.e. it is guarded.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yanai learn from "vi'Sh'arecha"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that a house is Kove'a only if it entered through the gate (the normal entrance), to exclude if it entered through the roof or Karfef (storage area).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (against both - Rav Chanina Chuza'ah - Beraisa):</span> "K'Nafshecha" - a worker is like the landowner. Just like the owner may eat without tithing, also a worker.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A buyer must tithe before eating. (A sale is Kove'a, like final processing.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This applies even in the field! (Rashi - final processing is Kove'a no less than a sale; Tosfos - the Amora'im said Stam that Peros are exempt until they enter the house or Chatzer, i.e. even if one bought them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> No. The case is, a fig tree is in a garden, and the foliage extends into a Chatzer (or according to R. Yanai, into a house).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, also the owner must tithe before eating!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. The owner's primary concern is the tree itself. Since the tree is in the garden, the fruit is Kavu'a only when all of it is brought inside;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The buyer cares only about what he bought. Since that is in the Chatzer (or house), it is Kavu'a.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Mid'Oraisa, one need not tithe bought Peros!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The stores of Beis Hino were destroyed three years before Yerushalayim because they stuck to Torah law (and neglected a Rabbinical enactment).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">88b----------------------------------------88b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Aser... V'Achalta (you must tithe what you will eat)", but not what you sell;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"(Tithe) Tevu'as Zar'echa (what you grew)", but not what you buy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, a sale is Kove'a the Peros mid'Rabanan. Mid'Oraisa, it is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (If a buyer is exempt, also a worker is.) What does "k'Nafshecha" teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "K'Nafshecha" - just like if one muzzles himself he is exempt (from lashes), also if he muzzles a worker.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Zutra - Mishnah):</span> The final processing for Ma'aser for gourds and pumpkins is from when Yifkesu.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Asi):</span> This is when the flower falls off the top.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is even in the field!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is in the house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so (the Chidush is, that it is exempt until then), it should not say 'from when Yifkesu', rather, 'not until Yifkesu'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That would connote until all the flowers fall off. 'From when Yifkesu' connotes once they start to fall off.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Nachman - Beraisa):</span> After final processing of Tevel (untithed Peros), one who eats it is liable. The final processing is Hachnasah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Hachnasah means gathering it, even in the field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, it is bringing it into the house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Yanai said that entering the house is Kove'a only for grapes and olives (which one plans to eat. He does not pile them up in the field.) For grain (which one piles up in the field), the Torah explicitly says ("ka'Dagan Min ha'Goren" - Bamidbar 18:27) that it becomes Kavu'a there!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>EATING DETACHED <i>PEROS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>We have learned that a person eats attached Peros, and ("Lo Sachsom Shor b'Disho" teaches) that an animal eats detached Peros (when they work);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a person eats detached Peros?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>No verse permits an ox to eat attached Peros, yet the Torah permits it to eat detached Peros. The Torah explicitly permits man to eat attached Peros, all the more so he may eat detached!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from an ox, for one may not muzzle it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches that it is also forbidden to muzzle man!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There is no Mitzvah to help animals survive, yet one may not muzzle them. We are commanded about man "v'Chei Achicha Imach", all the more so one may not muzzle him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "K'Nafshecha" - (the law of) a worker is like the owner himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like if one muzzles himself he is exempt, also if he muzzles a worker.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Question (b) remains. What is the source that a person may eat detached Peros?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It says "Kamah" twice. Only one is needed to permit man to eat attached Peros, so the other is used to permit detached.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Ami):</span> We do not need an extra verse for this. "B'Cherem Re'echa" includes when he was hired to carry detached grapes!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ANIMALS EAT ATTACHED <i>PEROS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that an animal eats attached Peros?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>No verse permits man to eat detached Peros, yet the Torah permits him to eats attached. The Torah commands us to let an ox eat attached Peros, all the more so it eats detached!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from man, for we are commanded to help him survive!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches that we are commanded to help animals survive!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may muzzle man, yet we are commanded to help him survive. One may not muzzle animals, all the more so we are commanded to help them survive!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Chei <i>Achicha</i> Imach" - we are commanded to help man survive, not animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Question (a) remains. What is the source that an animal eats attached Peros?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It says "Re'echa" twice. Only one is needed to teach that man eats attached Peros, the other is used to teach that animals eat attached Peros.</p>
