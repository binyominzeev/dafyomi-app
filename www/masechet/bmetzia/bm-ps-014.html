<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE BERAISA REFUTES SHMUEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Shmuel establishes the Mishnah like R. Elazar. The Beraisa refutes him like it refutes R. Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Also, Shmuel said that one who finds a Hakna'ah document should return it, for we are not concerned for repayment. The Beraisa says that we do not return a document with Achrayus, even when both admit. This implies that we are concerned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All the more so, when the borrower does not admit, we are concerned!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Chachamim hold that every document should have Achrayus. If it is not mentioned in the document, we attribute this to a mistake of the scribe, and we consider it as if Achrayus is written in the document.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava bar Isi):</span> This contradicts another teaching of Shmuel!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> A scribe must consult (with Reuven, the seller of a field) before writing the following provisions in the document (in case a creditor will take the field from the buyer (Shimon)):</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Improvements (if Shimon improved the field and it was taken, Reuven compensates him);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Idis (Shimon will be compensated from highest quality land);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>A lien (on Reuven's property to repay Shimon if the land is taken).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> One of these teachings was mistakenly said in Shmuel's name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. Regarding a loan, every document should have Achrayus. One lends money only on condition to get it back;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding a sale, the scribe must consult. People sometimes buy land for a day (i.e. without assurance that they will keep it a long time).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Avuha bar Ihi bought an upper story from his sister. His sister's creditor took it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> Did she write for you Achrayus?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Avuha:</span> No.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> You receive no compensation.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Avuha:</span> You hold that if Achrayus is not mentioned in the document, this is a scribal mistake!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> That refers to a loan. Regarding a sale, people sometimes buy land for a day.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LAWS THAT MIGHT DEPEND ON WHETHER OR NOT ONE SOLD WITH <i>ACHRAYUS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Abaye):</span> If Reuven sold a field to Shimon with Achrayus, and Reuven's creditor (Levi) took it, Reuven can take Levi to Beis Din to contest this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Levi cannot say 'you have no claim against me (since I did not take from you)', because Reuven must compensate Shimon for what Levi took.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Abaye):</span> Even if Reuven sold without Achrayus, he can take Levi to Beis Din. (Even though Reuven need not compensate Shimon,) he can say 'I don't want Shimon to bear a grudge against me.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Abaye):</span> If Reuven sold a field to Shimon without Achrayus, and people protested (said that the field belongs to them), before Shimon makes a Chazakah, he can withdraw from the sale. After making a Chazakah, he cannot.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven can say 'you knew that you were taking a risk.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is it considered that Shimon made a Chazakah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is from when he walks around the borders.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Even if Reuven sold with Achrayus, Shimon cannot retract after making a Chazakah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven can say 'if and when Beis Din rules that it is theirs, I will compensate you.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>COMPENSATION FOR IMPROVEMENTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If Reuven sold a field to Shimon, and it was found that it was not Reuven's, Shimon receives what he paid, and is also compensated for Shevach (improvements that he made to the land).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Shimon receives what he paid, but he is not compensated for Shevach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (According to Shmuel), if Reuven stipulated that he will compensate him for Shevach if it is taken, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shmuel exempts from compensating for Shevach because he did not stipulate, here he stipulated (he is liable)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps Shmuel's holds that since Shimon never truly received land, it is as if he lent Reuven the money. If Reuven will compensate him, it will look like interest, so even if he stipulated, he does not pay?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav Huna was unsure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> Shimon receives what he paid. He is not compensated for Shevach, even if Reuven stipulated;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since Shimon never received land, it would look like Ribis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> It was enacted that the following are not paid from Meshubadim: Peros that were eaten (this will be explained), Shevach to land, and food for the widow and daughters.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They are not paid from Meshubadim, but they are paid from Bnei Chorin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> 'Shevach to land' refers to when it was found to be stolen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. It is when a creditor took it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah teaches Peros that were eaten. A creditor who takes land does not take Peros!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> A creditor takes Shevach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He only takes Shevach, but not Peros!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We must say that the Mishnah discusses Peros in a case when the land was stolen. Presumably, the same applies to Shevach!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. Peros are in a case when the land was stolen. Shevach is when a creditor took it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Compensation for Shevach: if Yehudah stole David's field, when it is taken, he collects principal (what he paid) even from Meshubadim, and Shevach from Bnei Chorin (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it is like the Beraisa says, who should pay the thief?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Yehudah stole David's field and sold it to Moshe, who improved it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> The Beraisa must be corrected. We can correct it to discuss a creditor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Evaluation of Peros: Yehudah stole David's field. Behold, it leaves his hand; he collects principal from Meshubadim, and Peros from Bnei Chorin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it is like the Beraisa says, who should pay the thief?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Yehudah stole David's field and sold it to Moshe; who improved it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Rava):</span> The case is, Yehudah stole David's field laden with Peros. He ate the Peros and dug pits in the field. David collects principal (the decreased value of the land due to the pits) even from Meshubadim, and the value of the Peros from Bnei Chorin.</p>
