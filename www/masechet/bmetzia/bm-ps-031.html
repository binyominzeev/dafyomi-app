<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT IS CONSIDERED LOST? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If one found a garment or axe on a paved road, or a cow running through a vineyard, it is an Aveidah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A garment or axe next to the fence, or a cow grazing in the vineyard (Gra - in the grass) is not an Aveidah</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If this persisted for three straight days, it is an Aveidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If Reuven saw water coming to flood Shimon's field. he should block it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "L'Chol Aveidas Achicha" includes land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (R. Chananyah - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven saw water coming to flood Shimon's field, he should block it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Perhaps this is only when there are (detached) sheaves in the field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, surely he must save them! (They are like the examples of Aveidos in the Torah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, the sheaves need to remain attached a bit longer. One might have thought that they are considered like land (and Hashavas Aveidah does not apply to them). The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A donkey or cow...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The inferences contradict each other!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says that if it was grazing on the path, it is not an Aveidah. This implies that if it was running on the path or grazing in a vineyard, it would be an Aveidah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Then it says that a cow running through vineyards is an Aveidah. This implies that if it was running on the path or grazing in a vineyard, it would not be an Aveidah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Each case teaches about a similar case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was grazing on the path, it is not an Aveidah. The same applies if they were grazing in a vineyard!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it was running through vineyards, it is an Aveidah. The same applies if it was running on a path!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> If each case teaches about a similar case, it should teach the bigger Chidush each time!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It should teach that running on the path is an Aveidah, and all the more so, running in a vineyard!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It should teach that grazing in a vineyard is not an Aveidah, and all the more so, grazing on the path!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Running is an Aveidah if it is heading away from the city, but not if it is heading to the city;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A grazing animal is not an Aveidah, but it is a loss for the landowner!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It says that grazing on the path is not an Aveidah. Grazing in a vineyard is an Aveidah, i.e. a loss to the vineyard;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It says that a cow running through vineyards is an Aveidah. Grazing in a vineyard is not an Aveidah. This refers to the animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It gets wounded when running through a vineyard, but not when grazing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Grazing in a vineyard is an Aveidah, i.e. to the vineyard!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Kusi's vineyard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is a potential loss of the animal. Perhaps the Kusi will kill it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is in a place where they warn before killing the animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he already warned about it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, the owner knowingly gives up his animal. We are not commanded to save it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>MITZVOS</i> THAT MUST BE PERFORMED REPEATEDLY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he returned it and it got lost again, he returned it and it got lost again...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that "Hashev" teaches that it must be returned once, and "Teshivem" teaches a second time (but no more)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "Hashev" connotes even 100 times;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Teshivem" teaches that one may return not only to his house, rather, even to his garden or fallen house.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it is guarded there, obviously, it is returned!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If it is not guarded there, why is it considered returned?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, it is guarded. The Beraisa teaches that the owner need not know that it was returned;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> All thieves and Shomrim must inform the owners when returning the object. Only an Aveidah may be returned without the owner's knowledge, for the Torah included many ways to return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that "Shale'ach (send)" obligates sending (a bird crouching on eggs or chicks) once, and "Teshalach" teaches a second time (but no more)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "Shale'ach" connotes even 100 times;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Teshalach" obligates sending the bird even if he needs it for a Mitzvah (e.g. Taharas Metzora).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that "Hoche'ach" obligates rebuking once, and "Tochi'ach" teaches a second time (but no more)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "Hoche'ach" connotes even 100 times;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Tochi'ach" teaches that even a Talmid must rebuke his Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LOADING AND UNLOADING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Azov Ta'azov Imo" obligates helping to unload only if the owner helps!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Azov Ta'azov" obligates even if the owner cannot help.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Hakem Takim Imo" obligates helping to load only if the owner helps!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Hakem Takim" obligates even if the owner cannot help.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the Torah write both Mitzvos, loading and unloading?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Both are needed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only unloading, one might have thought that this is due to pain to the animal and a monetary loss to the owner (the animal gets weaker), but these do not apply to loading;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only about loading, one might have thought that that is because he is paid, but there would be no Mitzvah to unload for free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon says that also loading is for free. How can he answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He says that there is no indication which verse discusses loading and which discusses unloading. Had the Torah written only one, we would assume there is a Mitzvah only to unload.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the Torah write both these Mitzvos and the Mitzvah of returning an Aveidah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All are needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only loading and unloading, one might have thought that that it because there is pain both to the owner and animal, but regarding an Aveidah, there is pain only to the owner;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only returning an Aveidah, one might have thought that that it because the owner is not there (to save his object), but regarding loading and unloading, the owner is there, so he could hire people to help him!</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHAT WE EXPOUND FROM OTHER DOUBLED EXPRESSIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa) Question:</span> Perhaps "Mos Yamus ha'Makeh (the murderer will be killed)" is only like the Torah said, with a sword. What is the source that if we cannot kill him this way, we kill him any way we can?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Mos Yumas' - in any event.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "Hakeh Takeh" (you will destroy the city in which the majority of people served idolatry) is only like the Torah said, by burning. What is the source that if we cannot burn it, we destroy it any way we can?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Hakeh Takeh" - in any event.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "Hashev Tashiv (you will return)" discusses only a security taken with permission of Beis Din. What is the source for a security taken without permission of Beis Din?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Hashev Tashiv" - in any event.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "Chavol Tachbol" discusses returning only a security taken with permission of Beis Din. What is the source for a security taken without permission of Beis Din?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Chavol Tachbol" - in any event.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are both verses needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One (the latter) teaches about a day garment (one must return it before morning). The other teaches about a night garment (one must return it before nightfall).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "Paso'ach Tiftach (open your hand to give)" applies only to poor people of your city. What is the source that it applies even to poor people of another city?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Paso'ach Tiftach" - in any case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "Nason Titen" is only if you can give a big gift. What is the source that it applies even to a small gift?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Nason Titen" - in any case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "Ha'anek Ta'anik" (you will bestow a gift to a Yisrael slave when he goes free) is only if your house was blessed while he worked for you (like the verse says). What is the source that it applies even if it was not blessed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ha'anek Ta'anik" - in any event.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Elazar ben Azaryah, who says that you do not give him if the house was not blessed - why does the Torah say "Ha'anek Ta'anik"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah speaks like people do.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "Ha'avet Ta'avitenu (you will lend him)" is only if he has no money and does not want a gift. What is the source that it applies if he has money, but does not want to use it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ha'avet Ta'avitenu" - in any event.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Shimon, who says that if he has money and does not want to use it, we do not lend him - why does it say "Ha'avet Ta'avitenu"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah speaks like people do.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>HOW MUCH IS THE FINDER COMPENSATED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven lost one Sela of earnings, he may not demand compensation of one Sela. Rather, he is paid like a worker.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He is paid like an idle worker (the amount he would want to receive to consent to neglect his work and be idle).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He did not rest. He returned an Aveidah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> He is paid like a worker would want to receive to engage in light labor (such as returning an Aveidah) instead of his job.</p>
