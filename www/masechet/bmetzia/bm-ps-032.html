<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THINGS THAT MUST BE DONE IN FRONT OF <i>BEIS</i> <i>DIN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If there is a Beis Din there, he stipulates in front of them...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rav Safra and Isar had a joint business venture. Rav Safra, in front of two people, took half the merchandise without telling Isar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rabah bar Rav Huna:</span> Bring two of the three people in front of whom you divided, or two witnesses that saw you divide in front of three people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Safra):</span> What is the source that three are required?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Rav Huna - Mishnah):</span> If there is a Beis Din there, he stipulates in front of them. If not, he cannot stipulate. He is exempt from returning, because he would lose money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Safra):</span> To take money from the loser and give it to the finder requires Beis Din. I only took what is mine. I merely clarify that this is my portion. Two witnesses suffice!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> A widow can sell (from the estate for her food) not in front of Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> Rav Yosef bar Minyomi explained that the Mishnah teaches that she does not need a Beis Din of expert judges, but she must sell in front of three people!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHICH ANIMALS ARE CONSIDERED LOST</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one found an animal in a pen, he need not return it. If he finds one in the Reshus ha'Rabim, he must return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If it was in a cemetery, a Kohen may not become Tamei to return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If a man told his son (a Kohen) to become Tamei, or if he told him not to return an Aveidah (when this was permitted), the son may not listen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If Reuven helped Shimon load or unload even four or five times, Reuven must still help - "Azov Ta'azov";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon said, the Mitzvah is upon you, you can unload it yourself, Reuven is exempt - it says "Imo (with him)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Shimon is too old or sick to help, Reuven must do it himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The Torah only commands to unload, not to load; R. Shimon says, even to load.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yosi ha'Glili says, if the animal was overloaded, Reuven is exempt - "Tachas Masa'o (under its burden)" - a burden fit for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rava):</span> The Mishnah discusses a pen that does not induce animals to flee, nor does it guard them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It does not induce animals to flee, for the Mishnah says that he need not return it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It does not guard them. If it did, there would be no need to teach this;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One returns animals found outside to a guarded pen. All the more so, one need not return animals found in a guarded pen!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Mishnah):</span> If one found an animal in a pen, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> This is when it is within the Techum (2000 Amos around the city, where one may go on Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> When it is in the Reshus ha'Rabim, even within the Techum, he must return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Mishnah):</span> If one found an animal in the Reshus ha'Rabim, he must return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> This is when it is outside the Techum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> When it is in a pen, even outside the Techum, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN NOT TO LISTEN TO PARENTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it was in a cemetery, a Kohen may not become Tamei to return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that if a man told his son to become Tamei, or not to return an Aveidah, the son may not listen?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ish Imo v'Aviv Tira'u v'Es Shabsosai Tishmoru Ani Hash-m" - you are all obligated to honor Me.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> That is only due to the verse. Without it, we would say that he should listen!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Honoring parents is an Aseh, and neglecting an Aveidah is forbidden by a Lav and Aseh. An Aseh does not override a Lav and an Aseh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Honor of parents is equated to honor of Hash-m. It says "Kaved Es Avicha v'Es Imecha", and "Kaved Es Hash-m." Therefore, one might have thought that he should listen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The verse teaches that he may not.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>IS LOADING FOR FREE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Torah only commands to unload, not to load;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon says, even to load.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'not to load'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it means that it is not a Mitzvah to load at all, why is it different than unloading?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We learn unloading from "Azov Ta'azov." Likewise, we learn loading from "Hakim Takim"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Torah commands only to unload for free, but not to load for free. R. Shimon says, even to load for free..</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Unloading is for free, but loading is for pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, both are for free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If both were for free, the Torah should have written only loading, and we could learn unloading from a Kal va'Chomer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Loading does not save the owner from a loss, nor does it save the animal from pain, yet one is obligated. All the more so one must unload, which saves the owner from a loss and saves the animal from pain!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, unloading was written to teach that unloading is for free, but loading is for pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Shimon argues. He says that we cannot tell which verse discusses which. If only one verse were written, we would assume that it teaches unloading!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim hold that the verses are clear, for it says "Rovetz Tachas Masa'o (crouching under its load)", and "Nofelim ba'Derech" (the animal and its load are on the ground)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon holds that "Nofelim ba'Derech" could mean that the animal fell and the burden is on it.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">32b----------------------------------------32b</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>PAIN TO ANIMALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> From both Tana'im we learn that the Torah commands to minimize pain to animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even R. Shimon argues only because we cannot tell which verse discusses which. If we knew, he would make the Kal va'Chomer like Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Kal va'Chomer is due to pain to animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it is due to monetary loss of the owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One must load even though it does not save the owner from a loss. All the more so one must unload, which saves the owner from a loss!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Sometimes loading save the owner from a loss. A delay loading would reduce the time he has to sell his goods in the market, or robbers will take everything he has!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rava - Mishnah - R. Yosi ha'Glili):</span> If the animal was overloaded, Reuven is exempt - "Tachas Masa'o (under its burden)" - a burden fit for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Chachamim obligate helping even in this case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is mid'Oraisa, due to pain to animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps Chachamim simply do not expound "Tachas Masa'o"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (that pain to animals is not (forbidden) mid'Oraisa - Mishnah):</span> If Shimon said 'the Mitzvah is upon you. You can unload it yourself', Reuven is exempt. We learn from "with him".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If pain to animals were mid'Oraisa, whether or not Shimon helps, Reuven would be obligated!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, pain to animals is mid'Oraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah teaches that Reuven is exempt from unloading for free. He must unload, but he can demand payment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When Shimon helps, Reuven must unload for free. When he does not help, Reuven unloads for pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rava - Beraisa):</span> One must help with a Nochri's animal like with a Yisrael's.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand this if pain to animals is mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is not, what is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is to avoid resentment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (for rejection - Beraisa):</span> If it was carrying forbidden wine, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand this if pain to animals is not mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is mid'Oraisa, what is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Beraisa means, he is exempt from loading forbidden wine (but he is commanded to unload it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rava - Beraisa):</span> If a Nochri's animal bears a Yisrael's burden, "v'Chadalta (you refrain)".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If pain to animals is mid'Oraisa, he should be obligated!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Beraisa discusses loading.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If a Yisrael's animal bears a Nochri's burden, "Azov Ta'azov (help him)."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If pain to animals is not mid'Oraisa, he should be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is liable due to pain to the Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he should be obligated also in the Reisha!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Reisha discusses a Nochri donkey-driver. The Seifa discusses a Yisrael donkey-driver.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa does not specify. Why should we assume that this is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Normally, one goes with his animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Beraisa cannot discuss loading. The verses cited ("v'Chadalta" and "Azov Ta'azov") are written regarding unloading!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the Tana is R. Yosi ha'Glili, who says that pain to animals is not mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rava - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven's friend needs help unloading and Reuven's Sonei (one he hates) needs help loading, Reuven helps his Sonei, to overcome his Yetzer Ra (evil inclination).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If pain to animals is mid'Oraisa, unloading should take precedence!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even though pain to animals is mid'Oraisa, it is more important to overcome his Yetzer Ra.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The "Sonei" discussed (in the Torah) is a Yisrael, not a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If pain to animals is mid'Oraisa, it should make no difference!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa does not refer to "Sonei" written in the Torah, rather, to 'Sonei' in the Beraisa.</p>
