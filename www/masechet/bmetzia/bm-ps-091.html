<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LASHES FOR MUZZLING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If Reuven muzzled a threshing cow through his voice (he yelled to stop it from eating) or caused diverse species to lead a wagon, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> He is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan holds that moving one's mouth (to make voices) is considered an action. Reish Lakish says that it is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan - Mishnah):</span> ...We do not say that one may make Temurah (say that a Chulin animal should be in place of a Korban), rather, if one did, he receives forty lashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> That is according to R. Yehudah, who says that one is lashed even for a Lav without an action.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah cannot be R. Yehudah. The Reisha says 'anyone can make Temurah, both men and women.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does 'anyone' come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes an heir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> This is unlike R. Yehudah. He says that an heir cannot make Temurah or do Semichah (lean on the neck of the Korban)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana holds like R. Yehudah about lashes, and argues with him about heirs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven muzzled Shimon's cow (which he was renting or borrowing) and threshed with it, he is lashed and pays four Kavim (the estimated amount it would have eaten). For muzzling a donkey, he is lashed and pays three Kavim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The general rule is, one does not pay and receive lashes for one transgression!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The Beraisa is R. Meir, who says that one pays and is lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Torah disqualifies an Esnan (a harlot's hire) from being a Korban, even if a man hired his mother. (Even though he is liable to death for Bi'ah with her, so Beis Din cannot make him pay, if he pays, it is disqualified. It is called an Esnan because he truly owes her. To fulfill his obligation (b'Yedei Shamayim) he must pay. Similarly, even though Beis Din cannot make Reuven pay (since he is lashed for muzzling), he is liable to pay four Kavim. (Some say that if Shimon took the money, Beis Din does not make him return it.))</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> From the moment he was Moshech the cow (to begin his rental or borrowing), he is obligated to feed it. He is not liable for lashes until he threshes with it. (Since the obligations come at different times, he pays and is lashed.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CROSSBREEDING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> D'Vei Rav Papa bar Aba asked me if one may knead a dough with milk. I answered 'no.' This was correct.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may not knead a dough with milk. If one did, it is forbidden; lest he eat it with meat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We may not smear an oven (for baking bread) with lard. If one did, the first bread cooked inside is forbidden (unless the oven was heated up beforehand).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> D'Vei Rav Papa bar Aba asked me if one may put diverse species in a pen together. I answered 'no.' This was incorrect.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> To kill or lash people for forbidden Bi'ah, the witnesses must see them act like adulterers. To be liable for crossbreeding animals, one must bodily mate the male with the female.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Achdevoy bar Ami - Beraisa):</span> Had it said only "Behemtecha Lo Sarvi'a", one might have thought that the Torah forbids holding a (female) animal when it mates (even with a male of the same species). The verse adds "Kilayim" (to teach that the Isur applies only to diverse species).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This teaches that one is liable for Kilayim just for holding the female!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. 'Holding' (in the Beraisa) is a polite way of saying 'bodily mating (a male with a female)'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Within one species, one may bodily mate a male with a female. We are not concerned lest this arouse his lust.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">91b----------------------------------------91b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is occupied with his job.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Achdevoy bar Ami - Beraisa):</span> Had it said only "Behemtecha Lo Sarvi'a", one might have thought that the Torah forbids holding a (female) animal when it mates (even with a male of the same species). The verse adds "Kilayim".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This forbids holding the female regarding Kilayim, but it is permitted within one species;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Within one species, only holding the female is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. 'Holding' is a polite way of saying 'bodily mating'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (d'Vei Ravna Nechemyah Reish Galusa):</span> May one put a species in a pen with its own and a different species?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we assume that it will mate with its own species?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, are we concerned lest it mate with the other species?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> I told him that this is forbidden. This is not the Halachah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I was stringent (for him), lest his slaves come to lewdness.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW MUCH MUST AN EMPLOYEE WORK IN ORDER TO EAT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a worker was working only with his hands, or only with his legs, even just with his shoulders, he eats;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, he eats only if he works with his hands and legs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is (Chachamim's) reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ki Savo b'Cherem Re'echa" - whatever work you do there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> He eats only if he works with his hands and legs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yosi's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from an ox. An ox eats only when it works with its hands (forelegs) and (hind) legs. The same applies to a person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> According to R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah, if a chicken threshes, may one muzzle it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since it works with its full strength, he must let it eat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps one must let an animal eat only when it works with four limbs?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHICH TYPES OF FOODS MAY AN EMPLOYEE EAT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Workers (to stomp grapes) who did not yet traverse the length and width of the winery may eat grapes, but may not drink wine (they are working with grapes, but they have not yet made wine);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After traversing the length and width of the winery, they may eat grapes and drink wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was working with dates, he may not eat grapes, and vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A worker may withhold from eating until he reaches the place of good Peros;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Letter of the law, workers may eat only while working. To reduce the time they are idle from work, Chachamim permitted them to eat while walking from row to row or returning from the winepress;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A donkey may eat while they unload it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> If Reuven is working on one vine, may he eat from another vine?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we require only that he eat from the same species that he harvests for the owner, he may eat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he may eat only from what he is harvesting?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he may eat only from the vine he works on, how can an ox eat while working with attached Peros? (Rashi - the workers harvest vines near the wagon it pulls. Its head is far ahead, near different vines! Tosfos - when threshing attached Peros, it cannot eat from the stalk it threshes!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> It may eat from a very long vine or stalk (that stretches to where its head is).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was working with dates, he may not eat grapes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Dates and grapes are different species on separate trees. In a corresponding case of the same species (dates and dates) on separate trees, he may eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> No. The date branches are draped over the vines (or vice-versa); it is like eating from the same tree. (We may infer only that he may eat dates of the same tree, which is no Chidush.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> A worker may refrain from eating until he reaches a place of good Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one may eat from a different vine than the one he is working on, he may immediately eat from the good Peros!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, he must wait until he gets there so he does not detract time from his work.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Clarification:</span> This is obvious! The question was, may his wife or children bring him from other vines? (He would not detract from his work.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Mishnah):</span> Letter of the law, workers may eat only while working. To reduce the time they are idle from work, Chachamim permitted them to eat while walking from row to row or returning from the winepress.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Suggestion:</span> Walking is like working (on the vine he approaches), and even so, mid'Oraisa he may not eat (for one may eat only from the vine he is working on, and he is not there yet). He eats only due to the enactment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Walking is not like working, therefore, mid'Oraisa he may not eat. However, when working, he may eat even from vines that he is not working on.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Suggestion:</span> Walking is like not like working, therefore, mid'Oraisa he may not eat. If it were like working, he would be entitled to eat (even though he is not working on this (or any other) vine now!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Walking is like working. Even so, mid'Oraisa he may not eat, because a worker may eat only from the vine he is working on.</p>
