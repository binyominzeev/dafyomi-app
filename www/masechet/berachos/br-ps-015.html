<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PREPARATIONS FOR PRAYER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> To accept Ol Malchus Shamayim to the fullest extent, one should relieve himself, wash his hands, put on Tefilin, say Keri'as Shema and pray.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> If one does the above, it is as if he built a Mizbe'ach and offered a Korban on it -- "Erchatz b'Nikayon Kapai va'Asovevah Es Mizbachacha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Don't you also consider it as if he immersed? It says "Erchatz b'Nikayon" (connoting, I will wash my whole body), not "Architz Kapai"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> A Chacham came from Eretz Yisrael, he says that one who does not have water should clean his hands in dirt, pebbles or chips of wood!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> That is correct -- it does not say "I will wash in water," rather, "b'Nikayon" -- in anything that cleanses!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Chisda would curse one who delays praying (some explain - until after the allowed time) until he can wash his hands with water.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(Some delete from the text everything until the next Mishnah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>[This refers only to delaying Keri'as Shema (which must be said within the first three hours of the day), but one should travel to wash with water before Tefilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How far should one go to get water?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He should go up to a Parsah (four Mil);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is only if he was traveling, and in the direction that he was traveling; for one who must backtrack (or go to the side, or one who was not travelling) he must go only until one Mil.]</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MUST ONE PRAY AUDIBLY TO HIS OWN EARS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said Keri'as Shema inaudibly (to his own ears), he was Yotzei;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi says, he was not Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi says, if he did not articulate the letters properly, he was Yotzei;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah says, he was not Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If one said it out of order, he was not Yotzei;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If one erred, he should return to the place where he erred.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is R. Yosi's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Shema" teaches that one must say the words audibly to his own ears.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana expounds "Shema" -- "hear" in any language you understand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi learns both of these from "Shema."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>("Cheresh" usually refers to a deaf-mute; in this discussion, it refers to a deaf person who can speak.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #1):</span> A Cheresh should not take Terumah; if he did, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Tana holds that such a person is Yotzei, but only b'Di'eved?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> It is R. Yosi:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said Keri'as Shema inaudibly (to his own ears), he was Yotzei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, he was not Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> R. Yosi says that he is not Yotzei regarding Keri'as Shema, for it is mid'Oraisa -- but mid'Oraisa, Terumah can be taken silently;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Mid'Rabanan, one must recite a Berachah -- granted, he cannot hear his own Berachah, but this does not invalidate the Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Perhaps Mishnah #1 is not like R. Yosi, rather, like R. Yehudah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah said that he fulfills Keri'as Shema -- perhaps this is only b'Di'eved!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> It says, "If one said..." (and not "one may say"), connoting b'Di'eved!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, R. Yehudah permits even l'Chatchilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says, "If one said...," to teach the extremity of R. Yosi's opinion, that even b'Di'eved he was not Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, who is the Tana of the following?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> One may not say Birkas ha'Mazon silently; if he did, he was Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is not R. Yehudah, he permits l'Chatchilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It is not R. Yosi, he says that one is not Yotzei even b'Di'eved!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and support for Answer (m)):</span> Rather, you must say that it is like R. Yehudah, he permits only b'Di'eved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, who is the Tana of the following?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah brei d'R. Shimon ben Pazi - Beraisa #2):</span> A Cheresh may take Terumah l'Chatchilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is not R. Yehudah, he permits only b'Di'eved; it is not R. Yosi, he says that one is not Yotzei even b'Di'eved!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Beraisa #2 (which permits l'Chatchilah) is like R. Yehudah himself; Mishnah #1 and Beraisa #1 are R. Yehudah in the name of his Rebbi (who is Machshir b'Di'eved):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah citing R. Elazar ben Azaryah):</span> One who says Shema must say the words audibly to his own ears -- "Shema Yisrael..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> But it says, "Asher Anochi Metzavcha ha'Yom <i>Al Levavecha</i>" -- intent in the heart suffices!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Yehudah could agree with R. Elazar ben Azaryah, Beraisa #2 is like R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MUST ONE PRAY AUDIBLY TO HIS OWN EARS? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #2):</span> Anyone may recite Megilas Esther (and discharge the obligation for adults who hear him), except for a Cheresh, Shoteh (lunatic), or Katan (minor);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah permits a Katan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the first Tana, who invalidates a Cheresh even b'Di'eved?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Masnah):</span> It is R. Yosi:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said Keri'as Shema inaudibly (to his own ears), he was Yotzei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, he was not Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Perhaps the Mishnah is not R. Yosi (who says that even b'Di'eved, he was not Yotzei), rather, it is R. Yehudah, who permits b'Di'eved!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">15b----------------------------------------15b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be -- Cheresh is taught with [and thus certainly has the same law as] a Shoteh and Katan, who certainly are invalid even b'Di'eved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps the law of Cheresh is not exactly the same law as that of a Shoteh and Katan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot establish the first Tana to be R. Yehudah, for R. Yehudah argues in the Seifa (he permits a Katan)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps the entire Mishnah is R. Yehudah; it discusses two kinds of minors, and the Mishnah is abbreviated and means as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Anyone may recite the Megilah, except for a Cheresh, Shoteh, or Katan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This refers to a minor below the age of Chinuch (training in Mitzvos), but a minor at (or above) the age of Chinuch may recite l'Chatchilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This is like R. Yehudah, who is permits a Katan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Mishnah #2 like R. Yehudah, and R. Yehudah (in our Mishnah) permits only b'Di'eved, then who is the Tana of the following?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah brei d'R. Shimon ben Pazi - Beraisa #2):</span> A Cheresh may take Terumah l'Chatchilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is not R. Yehudah, he permits only b'Di'eved; it is not R. Yosi, he says that one is not Yotzei even b'Di'eved!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> If R. Yehudah permits l'Chatchilah, and Beraisa #2 is like Rebbi Yehudah, who is the Tana of Beraisa #1?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> One may not say Birkas ha'Mazon silently; if he did, he was Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It is not R. Yehudah, he permits l'Chatchilah; it is not R. Yosi, he says that one is not Yotzei even b'Di'eved!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to both questions):</span> Really, Beraisa #2 is like R. Yehudah. He permits l'Chatchilah. Beraisa #1 and Mishnah #2 are like R. Yehudah in the name of his Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah citing R. Elazar):</span> One must say Shema audibly to his own ears -- "Shema Yisrael..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> It says "Al Levavecha" -- intent suffices!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Yehudah could agree with R. Elazar, Beraisa #2 is like R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah in the name of R. Elazar ben Azaryah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah (in our Mishnah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>He must teach both of these:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had he taught only that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah, one might have thought that even l'Chatchilah it need not be audible to his ears;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had he taught only that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah in the name of R. Elazar, one might have thought that Shema must be audible to his ears, and a Cheresh cannot be Yotzei even b'Di'eved;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> They argue about Keri'as Shema, but regarding other Mitzvos, all agree that he was not Yotzei -- "Haskes u'Shema Yisrael" (you must hear yourself).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa #1):</span> One may not say Birkas ha'Mazon silently; if he did, he was Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Rav Yosef taught that they argue about Keri'as Shema, for it says "Shema Yisrael" but regarding other Mitzvos, all agree that he was Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it says "Haskes u'Shema Yisrael"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to Divrei Torah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ARTICULATING THE LETTERS PROPERLY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> If he did not articulate the letters properly...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Tavi):</span> The Halachah follows the leniencies of both Tana'im (he was Yotzei if he did not hear himself, like R. Yehudah; he was Yotzei if he did not articulate the letters, like R. Yosi).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Tavi) Question:</span> "Shalosh Henah Lo Sisbanah She'ol v'Otzer Rechem" -- what is the connection of the womb to the grave?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Just like the womb is a place of entry (of seed) and exit (of offspring), the grave is a place of entry (of a Mes) and exit (the dead will be revived).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Kal va'Chomer teaches this -- entry into the womb is done silently, exit is noisy; entry to the grave is noisy (crying and eulogies), all the more so the exit will be noisy!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This refutes those who say there is no source in written Torah for Techiyas ha'Mesim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yoshiyah - Beraisa):</span> "U'Chesav<i>tam</i>" -- everything must be written (in Tefilin and Mezuzos), even the commands "u'Keshartam... u'Chesavtam."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This is like R. Yehudah, who says regarding Sotah that the curses are written in the scroll, but not the commands;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There, he expounds, "v'Chasav Es ha'Alos ha'Eleh," to exclude the commands; here, it says only "u'Chesavtam," even commands are included.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is "u'Chesav<i>tam</i>" needed to include the commands? Regarding Sotah, "v'Chasav" would have included the commands, R. Yehudah excludes them only because it says "ha'Eleh," and this is not written here!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought to learn from Sotah, for it says "v'Chasav" in both places -- therefore, it must say "u'Chesavtam."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ovadyah - Beraisa):</span> "V'Limad<i>tem</i>" -- your recital must be Tam (pure), you must leave space between words that could blend one into the other;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Some examples are "Al Levavecha," "ha'Kanaf Pesil" (the second word begins with the final letter of the previous word).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Gehinom is cooled off for one who articulates the letters -- "b'Fares Shakai Melachim Bah Tashleg b'Tzalmon" -- we read "b'Faresh... b'Tzalmaves" (if you will say the words clearly, Hash-m will cool off Gehinom).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> "K'Nechalim Nitayu... ka'Ahalim Nata" -- why are springs and tents mentioned together? (Rashba - we ask why this follows the verse, "Mah Tovu Ohalecha Yakov," which discusses tents -- "ka'Ahalim" refers to spices.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Just like springs bring a person (who immerses in them) from Tum'ah to Taharah, tents (Batei Medrash, in which one learns Torah) bring a person from liability (in judgment) to merit.</p>
