<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Even if a person said the nighttime Shema in synagogue, he should repeat it before sleeping.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Asi):</span> He learns from "Rigzu v'Al Techeta'u Imru bi'Levavchem (i.e. Shema, which mentions "Al Levavecha," should be) Al Mishkavtem (said upon going to sleep) v'Domu Sela";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> A Chacham need not repeat it (it suffices that he is always learning).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Even a Chacham should say verses arousing mercy, such as "b'Yadcha Afkid Ruchi Padisah Osi Hash-m Kel Emes."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Levi bar Chama):</span> A person should always arouse his Yetzer Tov to fight his Yetzer ha'Ra -- "Rigzu v'Al Techeta'u";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he does not overpower his Yetzer ha'Ra, he should learn Torah -- "Imru bi'Levavchem";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he still does not overpower it, he should recite Shema -- "Al Mishkavchem";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he still does not overpower it, he should think about the day of death -- "v'Domu Sela."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Levi bar Chama):</span> "V'Etnah Lecha Es Luchos ha'Even veha'Torah veha'Mitzvah Asher Kasavti Lehorosam" -- "Luchos" are the Ten Commandments, "Torah" is the written Torah (Chumash), "Mitzvah" is Mishnah, "Asher Kasavti" is Nevi'im and Kesuvim, "Lehorosam" is Gemara;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that all of these were given at Sinai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Anyone who reads Shema before sleep is like one who bears a double-edged sword (to kill Mazikin) -- "Romemos Kel bi'Gronam v'Cherev Pifiyos b'Yadam."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the verse refers to Keri'as Shema?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar Zutra):</span> Before this it says "Yalzu Chasidim b'Chavod Yeranenu Al Mishkevosam."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Mazikin avoid one who reads Shema before sleep -- "u'Venei Reshef Yagbihu Uf";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Uf" is Torah -- "Ha'sa'if Einecha v'Einenu" (if you close your eyes from Torah, you will forget it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Reshef" is Mazikin -- "Mezei Ra'av u'Lechumei Reshef."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>AFFLICTIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> One who learns Torah is not beset by afflictions -- "u'Venei Reshef Yagbihu Uf";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Uf" is Torah -- "Ha'sa'if Einecha v'Einenu."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even children learning Chumash know that -- "Im Shamo'a Tishma... Kol ha'Machalah Asher Samti b'Mitzrayim Lo Asim Alecha"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If one could engage in Torah and does not, he is beset by ugly afflictions -- "Ne'elamti Dumiyah Hechesheisi mi'Tov u'Ch'evi Nekar";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Tov" is Torah -- "Ki Lekach Tov Nasati Lachem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> Hash-m's ways are unlike the ways of people:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When a person sells something, he is sad, the buyer is happy -- Hash-m gave Torah to Yisrael and was happy (He wants us to keep it) -- "Ki Lekach Tov Nasati Lachem Torasi Al Ta'azovu."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If afflictions come upon a person, he should inspect his deeds -- "Nachpesah Derachenu v'Nachkorah v'Nashuvah Ad Hash-m";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he inspected his deeds and did not find sin, he should attribute the afflictions to Bitul Torah -- "Ashrei ha'Gever Asher Teyasrenu Kah umi'Torascha Selamdenu." (Emes l'Yakov -- other sins would not bring afflictions unless they were b'Mezid, he would have found them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he attributed the afflictions to Bitul Torah, but cannot find any, they are afflictions of love (not on account of sin, rather, to increase his reward in the World to Come - Rashi; Maharsha - to atone for others) -- "Ki Es Asher Ye'ehav Hash-m Yochi'ach."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Anyone whom Hash-m likes, He crushes him with afflictions -- "v'Hashem Chafetz Dak'o Hecheli";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they atone for him even if he does not accept them with love!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Im Tasim Asham Nafsho" -- just like a Korban Asham must be offered willingly, afflictions must be accepted willingly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he accepts them, what is his reward?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yir'eh Zera Ya'arich Yamim" (he will have children and live a long life);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, he will remember his learning -- "v'Chefetz Hash-m b'Yado Yitzlach."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yakov bar Idi or R. Acha bar R. Chanina):</span> Afflictions of love are those that do not cause Bitul Torah -- "Ashrei ha'Gever Asher Teyasrenu Kah umi'Torascha Selamdenu";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(The other of R. Yakov bar Idi and R. Acha bar R. Chanina):</span> They are those that do not cause Bitul Tefilah -- "Baruch Elokim Asher Lo Hesir Tefilasi v'Chasdo me'Iti."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba brei d'R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Both of these are afflictions of love -- "Ki Es Asher Ye'ehav Hash-m Yochi'ach";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it says "umi'Torascha Selamdenu" (You (Hash-m) will teach him, i.e. he will still be able to learn)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We read this "Selamdeinu" (the Torah teaches us that one who is afflicted is fortunate; Maharshal -- we read it "Limadtanu," You taught this to us);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a master knocks out the tooth or eye of his slave, a single limb, the slave goes free; afflictions scour the entire body, all the more so they free him (from liability for his sins).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The Torah discusses Bris Melach -- "v'Lo Sashbis Melach Bris" (all Korbanos must be salted), and a Bris concerning afflictions (the curses in Ki Savo) -- "Eleh Divrei ha'Bris";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like salt makes meat tastier, also afflictions purge a person of his sin (some texts -- afflictions likewise turn his sins into merits - Etz Yosef).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Hash-m gave three great gifts to Yisrael, all came through afflictions -- Torah, Eretz Yisrael and the World to Come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Torah was given through afflictions?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ashrei ha'Gever Asher Teyasrenu Kah umi'Torascha Selamdenu."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We know that Eretz Yisrael was given through afflictions, for it says "Ki ka'Asher Yeyaser Ish Es Beno," and then "Hash-m Elokecha Mevi'acha El Eretz Tovah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We learn that the World to Come was given through afflictions, for it says "Ki Ner Mitzvah v'Sorah Or v'Derech Chayim Sochechos Musar."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>AFFLICTIONS BRING ATONEMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(A reciter of Beraisos):</span> If one engages in Torah and Chesed and buries his children, all of his sins are pardoned.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> I understand your source for Torah and Chesed -- it says "b'Chesed v'Emes Yechupar Avon";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Emes" refers to Torah -- "Emes Keneh v'Al Timkor."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>What is the source that burying one's children brings pardon?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (an elder citing R. Shimon):</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Avon-Avon";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "b'Chesed v'Emes Yechupar Avon," and "u'Meshalem Avon Avos El Cheik Beneihem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Tzara'as and [loss of] children are not afflictions of love.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Any of the four appearances of Tzara'as is like a Mizbe'ach to bring atonement for a person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Tzara'as is like a Mizbe'ach of atonement, it is not afflictions of love.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #2:</span> It is afflictions of love for people in Chutz la'Aretz, but not for people in Eretz Yisrael (Rashi - they must leave the city; Tosfos - they must be careful about Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Maharsha - Answer #2:</span> It is afflictions of love for others (who are forgiven through the suffering of Tzadikim), not for the Tzadikim stricken with the Tzara'as. (End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> It is afflictions of love if it is in a covered place, not if it is exposed (then one is greatly embarrassed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Yochanan really hold that [loss of] children is not an affliction of love?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He used to console people by saying, "This is a bone from my tenth son (all of them died. Tosfos - surely, he only said this to others because it is afflictions of love; Rashi - surely, afflictions of a Tzadik like R. Yochanan are of love)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If one had children and lost them, this is an affliction of love (the mourning atones for him); if one never had children, this is not an affliction of love.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>REMEDYING AFFLICTIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Chiya bar Aba fell sick; R. Yochanan came to visit him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Do you cherish afflictions?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> I do not desire them nor their reward (because they are causing Bitul Torah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yochanan took his hand, and R. Chiya recovered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The same dialogue occurred when R. Yochanan fell sick, and R. Chanina resuscitated him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't R. Yochanan cure himself?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A prisoner cannot free himself from prison.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Elazar fell sick; R. Yochanan came to visit him, and saw that the house was dark. He uncovered his arm, illuminating the house (R. Yochanan had a great radiance); he saw that R. Elazar was crying.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> If you are crying because you did not learn enough Torah, do not cry -- we learned that it does not matter whether one learns a lot or a little, as long as his intentions are for the sake of Shamayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If you are crying because you were poor, do not cry -- not everyone merits two worlds of wealth (Torah and monetary)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If you are crying because you lost children, do not cry -- this is a bone from my tenth son!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> I cry because your beauty (Maharsha - the last remnant of the beautiful people of Yerushalayim) will eventually rot in the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Yochanan agreed that it is worthy to cry over this; he also cried. He asked, "Do you cherish afflictions?" R. Elazar said that he does not desire them nor their reward; R. Yochanan resuscitated him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Four hundred barrels of Rav Huna's wine spoiled; he came to Rav Yehudah and Rabanan, they told him to examine his deeds.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> Do you suspect that Hash-m would punish you without reason?!</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> This is like people say, one who steals from a thief tastes theft.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Rav Huna's wine became good again.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>PROPER CONDUCT REGARDING PRAYER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Aba Binyamin):</span> I always exerted myself about two things:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>That my Tefilah should be near my bed.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This is meant literally.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Yehudah taught that when one prays, nothing should separate him from the wall in front -- "va'Yasev Chizkiyahu Panav El ha'Kir va'Yispalel"!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It means, "my Tefilah should be close to my bed," i.e. to say Keri'as Shema and pray right after rising, before working (Rashi - or learning).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>That my bed should be north-south.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Anyone who put his bed between north-south merits to have sons -- "u'Tzefuncha Temalei Vitnam Yibe'u Vanim." (Ramban (Igeres ha'Kodesh)- this refers to having relations at the intermediate time, between the extremes of north (cold, i.e. hunger) and south (heat, i.e. satiation).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Aba Binyamin):</span> If two people enter a synagogue together to pray, and one leaves before the other finishes, the Tefilah [of the first] is torn up -- "Toref Nafsho b'Apo ha'Lema'ancha Te'azev Aretz";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, it causes the Shechinah to depart from Yisrael -- "v'Yetak Tzur mi'Mekomo."</p>
