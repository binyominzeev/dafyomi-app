<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Ada):</span> Rav Acha learns (about the harp over David's bed) from "Urah Chevodi Urah ha'Nevel v'Chinor A'irah ha'Shachar."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 4:i, 3b - R. Zeira):</span> Moshe and David both knew when midnight is.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did David need the harp to start playing then?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was to wake him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Moshe knew, why did he say, "ka'Chatzos"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He was concerned lest Pharaoh's astrologers will err, and say that Moshe lied.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It was taught -- train yourself to say, "I do not know," lest you will be caught saying a falsity.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Moshe was speaking to Yisrael at midnight of the 14th; he told them "ka'Chatzos," i.e. at this same time tomorrow, Hash-m will kill the firstborns.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DAVID'S <i>CHASIDUS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Levi or R. Yitzchak):</span> "L'David Shamrah Nafshi Ki Chasid Ani" -- David considers himself a Chasid (one who goes beyond the letter of the law) because "other kings sleep until three hours of the day, and I rise at midnight to praise You."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Levi and R. Yitzchak):</span> David considers himself a Chasid because "other kings sit amidst grandeur, and my hands are dirty with blood, Shefir (the outer skin of an aborted fetus) and Shilya (fetal sac), in order to be Metaher women to permit them to their husbands";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Also -- I consult with my Rebbi, Mefiboshes, about everything -- I do not refrain on account of shame (even though sometimes he tells me that I erred)!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua brei d'Rav Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> He learns from "va'Adabrah v'Edosecha v'Lo Evosh."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> His real name was Ish Boshes -- he is called Mefiboshes because he shamed David in Halachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This is why David merited that Kal'ev descended from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> His real name was Daniel -- he is called Kal'ev because he was HiChLim (shamed) Mefiboshes in Halachah -- "Chacham Beni v'Samach Libi v'Ashivah Chorfi Davar."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did David really call himself a Chasid?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi) Question:</span> "Lulei He'emanti Lir'os b'Tuv Hash-m b'Eretz Chayim" -- why are there dots on top of "Lulei"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> David told Hash-m, "I know that You pay a good reward to Tzadikim in the World to Come, but I do not know whether or not I will have a share among them, for perhaps I will lose my portion on account of sin!"</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (R. Yakov bar Idi):</span> Hash-m promised Yakov, "... u'Shemarticha b'Chol Asher Telech," yet it says, "va'Yira Yakov Me'od"!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was concerned that he sinned and thereby forfeited Hash-m's promise.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Ad Ya'avor Amcha Hash-m Ad Ya'avor Am Zu Kanisa" -- these refer to the two times Yisrael entered Eretz Yisrael, in the days of Yehoshua and the days of Ezra;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>The verse equates them -- Yisrael should have entered the second time amidst miracles like the first time; they did not, because they sinned.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE TIME FOR SAYING THE NIGHTTIME <i>SHEMA</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> The time extends until midnight.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom do Chachamim hold?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they hold like R. Eliezer (that the Mitzvah is when most people go to sleep), they should say as he says (until four hours);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">4b----------------------------------------4b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they hold like R. Gamliel (it is as long as people are sleeping), they should say as he says (until dawn)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, they hold like R. Gamliel; they say "until midnight" to distance people from transgressing (lest one not say the nighttime Shema before dawn).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Chachamim made a protective fence, lest a person come home from the field and say, "I will eat and sleep a bit, and later I will say Shema and pray" -- perhaps he will sleep the entire night!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, when a person comes from the field, he should go to the synagogue; he should read (Torah, Nevi'im or Kesuvim) or learn Mishnayos, whatever he is accustomed to learning. [In the proper time] he will read Shema and pray -- afterwards, he will eat his bread and bless;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Anyone who transgresses Chachamim's words is Chayav Misah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say specifically concerning this decree that anyone who transgresses Chachamim's words is Chayav Misah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is common that people are overcome by sleep.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Tana holds that Ma'ariv is mandatory, he says this to argue with the opinion that it is optional.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He will read Shema and pray...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>This supports R. Yochanan:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> A Ben Olam ha'Ba is one who is Somech Ge'ulah l'Tefilah (starts Shemoneh Esreh right after the Keri'as Shema and its Berachos, which discuss redemption) at Ma'ariv.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Tefilos (Shmoneh Esreh) were fixed in the middle (after the morning Shema, and before the nighttime Shema).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about reasoning, or about a verse:</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Possibility #1:</span> They argue about reasoning -- R. Yochanan holds that the redemption (from Mitzrayim) was also at night (therefore, we must be Somech Ge'ulah l'Tefilah), R. Yehoshua ben Levi holds that since it was not complete until the day, the Ge'ulah at night is not so important.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Possibility #2:</span> They argue about a verse, "uv''Shochbecha uv''Kumecha" -- R. Yochanan holds that this equates lying down to rising;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like when we rise, [the morning] Shema is before Tefilah, also when we lie down (and say the nighttime Shema);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua ben Levi equates lying down to rising differently -- just like when we rise, Shema is closer to sleep than Tefilah (i.e. before Tefilah), also when we lie down (saying Shema is closer to sleep, i.e. after Tefilah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar brei d'Ravina):</span> At night one makes two Berachos before Shema and two afterwards;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If so, one is not being Somech Ge'ulah l'Tefilah, because the second Berachah after Shema, "Hashkiveinu," does not mention Ge'ulah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the Chachamim appended it to the first Berachah (of Ge'ulah) after Shema, it is like part of Ge'ulah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> We must give such an answer to explain how one is Somech Ge'ulah l'Tefilah at Shacharis!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One must say "Hash-m Sefasai Tiftach..." before Shemoneh Esreh; afterwards, one must say "Yiheyu Leratzon...."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that since the Chachamim appended it to Tefilah, it is like part of Tefilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Likewise, since the Chachamim appended "Hashkiveinu" to the Berachah of Ge'ulah, it is like part of Ge'ulah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>TEHILAH L'DAVID</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avina):</span> Anyone who says "Tehilah l'David" ("Ashrei Yoshvei Veisecha") three times a day is guaranteed to have a share in Olam ha'Ba.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is because it is written according to the Alef-Beis (and declares the praise of Hash-m in a full manner; Penei Yehoshua -- it strengthens one's belief that the entire world is just for the sake of Torah, which was given through the Alef-Beis).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the same should apply to "Ashrei Temimei Derech" (Tehilim 119), which is written according to an eight-fold Alef-Beis!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is because it says "Pose'ach Es Yadecha..." (Hash-m feeds the entire world).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the same should apply to Hallel ha'Gadol (Tehilim 136), which says "Nosen Lechem l'Chol Basar"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is because it has both of these attributes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> Why is there no verse in Ashrei beginning with "Nun"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Nun" alludes to the downfall of the haters (this is a euphemism) of Yisrael -- "Naflah Lo Sosif Kum Besulas Yisrael";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In Eretz Yisrael, they explain "Naflah Lo Sosif" (Yisrael fell, she will not continue to fall); "Kum Besulas Yisrael" -- now, she will rise.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Nevertheless, David mentions (in Ashrei) supporting the fallen -- "Somech Hash-m l'Chol ha'Noflim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar bar Avina):</span> Regarding Micha'el it says, "va'Ya'af Elai Echad Min ha'Serafim" (one jump), whereas "veha'Ish Gavri'el... Mu'af bi'Af" (he required two jumps).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the first verse refers to Micha'el?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Echad-Echad" -- "Micha'el Achad ha'Sarim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Micha'el gets to his destination in one jump, Gavri'el requires two jumps, Eliyahu requires four, the Malach ha'Maves requires eight;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>At the time of a plague, the Malach ha'Maves only needs one.</p>
