<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TEFILAS HA'DERECH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yakov):</span> Anyone who journeys must say Tefilas ha'Derech.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Tefilas ha'Derech?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "May it be Your will to lead me, direct me, and support me towards peace, to save me from any enemies or ambush on the way, to bless my endeavors, and grant me grace, kindness and mercy in Your eyes and the eyes of all who see me; Baruch Atah Hash-m Shome'a Tefilah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> When one prays, he should pray for the public as well.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How should he say Tefilas ha'Derech?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "May it be Your will to lead <i>us</i>..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is the earliest one may say Tefilas ha'Derech?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yakov):</span> He may say it once he is on the road.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Question:</span> When is the latest time to say Tefilas ha'Derech?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It should be said before going a Parsah (about four kilometers).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Bahag) Question:</span> What is the smallest trip for which Tefilas ha'Derech should be said?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is said for a trip of at least a Parsah. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is it said?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> It is said while standing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> It may be said even while travelling.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Rav Chisda and Rav Sheshes were travelling; Rav Chisda stood up (to say Tefilas ha'Derech).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes (who was blind, to his servant):</span> What is he doing?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">His servant:</span> He is praying.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes (to his servant):</span> Help me to stand and I will also pray -- I agree that this is better, and there is no reason not to (I want to wait for Rav Chisda anyway).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between saying the "short prayer" said when in danger and saying Havinenu?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Havinenu is preceded by and followed by three blessings; one who says Havinenu is exempt from Tefilah when he gets home;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The short prayer is not preceded or followed by other blessings; one who says it must pray when he gets home.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>The Halachah is, Havinenu must be said while standing, the short prayer may be said while standing or travelling.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PRAYING WHILE TRAVELLING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was riding on a donkey...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one was riding on a donkey and the time for prayer came:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there is someone else to watch his donkey, he must come down to pray;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If not, he may sit stationary and pray.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rebbi says, in either case he may sit stationary and pray, for his mind is not settled (he is bothered by the delay in his journey).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah follows Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A blind person, or one who does not know the direction (towards the Mikdash) should direct his thoughts to his Father in Heaven -- "v'Hispalelu El Hash-m";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who is in Chutz la'Aretz should face towards Eretz Yisrael -- "v'Hispalelu Elecha Derech Artzam";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who is in Eretz Yisrael should face towards Yerushalayim -- "v'Hispalelu El Hash-m Derech ha'Ir Asher Bacharta";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One who is in Yerushalayim should face the Mikdash -- "v'Hispalelu El ha'Bayis ha'Zeh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>One who is in the Mikdash should face the Kodesh ha'Kodashim -- "v'Hispalelu El ha'Makom ha'Zeh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>One who is in the Kodesh ha'Kodashim should face the Beis ha'Kapores (the wall in back of the Aron);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>One who is in back of the Beis ha'Kapores should [face west, towards Beis ha'Kapores, but] consider himself as if he was in front of it (R. Yonah - with most of Yisrael, who face east).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Wherever one is, he faces towards Beis ha'Kapores; all of Yisrael face one place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin):</span> We learn from "... Tzavarech Banuy l'<i>Salpiyos</i>" -- the Tel (mound) towards which all Piyos (mouths) turn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>When Shmuel's father and Levi wanted to travel, they would pray [Shemoneh Esreh] early (Tosfos - between dawn and sunrise; Rashi (according to Tosfos) - before dawn);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When the time for Shema came, they would say Shema.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom did they conduct themselves?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They conducted themselves like the following Tana:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one must travel early, [he first performs the Mitzvos of the day, such as] he hears a Shofar, shakes a Lulav, or hears Megilas Esther before leaving; when the time for Shema comes, he says Shema;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one rises early to ride in a wagon or boat, he prays first; when the time for Shema comes, he says Shema;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, in either case he says Shema (in the proper time) and then prays, in order to be Somech Ge'ulah l'Tefilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first Tana holds that praying while standing is more important than being Somech Ge'ulah l'Tefilah, R. Shimon holds that being Somech Ge'ulah l'Tefilah is more important.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>On the Shabbos before the festival, Mereimar and Mar Zutra would gather ten people and pray, and then expound in the Beis Medrash. (The Talmidim would leave one at a time to pray.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rav Ashi would pray by himself amidst his Talmidim (while the translator was broadcasting a long part of his discourse), while sitting; after the class, he would go home and pray again, standing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Talmidim:</span> Why don't you do like Mereimar and Mar Zutra?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> It would be a burden to delay the class so long.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Talmidim:</span> Why don't you do like Shmuel's father and Levi (pray before Shema)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> We do not find that previous Chachamim did so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE ENACTMENT TO SAY MUSAF</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer ben Azaryah):</span> The enactment to say Musaf applies only in a Tzibur;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, it applies even to an individual.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, R. Eliezer ben Azaryah exempts an individual from Musaf in any place where there is a Tzibur (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> R. Yehudah says just like the first Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about an individual in a place where there is no Tzibur -- the first Tana exempts, R. Yehudah obligates.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna bar Chinena):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> That is correct -- Shmuel said that the only time he ever prayed Musaf by himself in Neharde'a was the day that the king's army came and prevented Chachamim from praying;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">30b----------------------------------------30b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>That day, he was an individual in a place without a Tzibur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina Kara (see Rashi to Taanis 27b)):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">R. Yanai:</span> That is wrong -- the Halachah does not follow R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> I saw R. Yanai pray (without a Tzibur) twice (in succession, i.e. Shacharis and Musaf).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Perhaps he repeated the same prayer because he did not have proper intention the first time!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> A great Chacham testified about this, surely he knew that he prayed Musaf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Even though there were 13 synagogues in Tiverya, R. Ami and R. Asi would pray only where they learned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CORRECTING AN OMISSION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Chiya bar Aba prayed twice (in succession).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> Why did you do this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps you did not have good intention the first time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> [Surely this did not happen --] R. Elazar taught that one should estimate whether or not his mind is settled enough to have intention -- if not, he should not pray!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> You forgot to mention Rosh Chodesh (in Ya'aleh v'Yavo), therefore you prayed again.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> If one forgot to mention Rosh Chodesh in Ma'ariv, he does not go back, for he can say it in Shacharis;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he forgot to mention it in Shacharis, he does not go back, for he can mention it in Musaf; if he forgot to mention it in Musaf (Rashi - he prayed a regular Shemoneh Esreh), he does not go back, for he can mention it in Minchah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> Indeed, that was the reason;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan taught, the Beraisa only exempts one who is praying with a Tzibur (Rashi - for one who will hear the Shali'ach Tzibur mention Rosh Chodesh; Bahag - it only exempts a Shali'ach Tzibur, to avoid burdening the Tzibur), but an individual must pray again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one will pray twice in succession (Shacharis and Musaf; alternatively, if he must repeat Shemoneh Esreh), how long must he pause between prayers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna and Rav Chisda):</span> He must pause until his mind is settled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One of them expressed this "until his mind <i>Tischonen</i>," as we find in the verse, "va'Eschanan El Hash-m";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The other expressed this "until his mind <i>Tischolel</i>," as we find, "va'Yechal Moshe."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Anan citing Rav):</span> If one forgot to mention Rosh Chodesh in Ma'ariv, he does not go back, for [Kedushas Rosh Chodesh applies primarily during the day, since] Beis Din is not Mekadesh the month at night, only during the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> Presumably, Rav's law applies only to one who forgot on the first night of Rosh Chodesh when the [previous] month was full (30 days), for then [there are two days of Rosh Chodesh, the primary one is the second,] he will mention Rosh Chodesh the next night;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the month was short (29 days), he must repeat Shemoneh Esreh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> Rav explained, the reason is because Beis Din is not Mekadesh the month at night, only during the day -- this applies whether the month was full or short.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK EIN OMDIM</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>SUBMISSIVENESS BEFORE PRAYER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One stands to pray only out of submissiveness;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chasidim of old would wait one hour (where they would pray) before praying [Shemoneh Esreh], in order to direct their thoughts to Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Even if the king greets one during prayer, he should not answer; even if a snake wraps itself around his heel, he should not interrupt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> We learn from "v'Hi Maras Nefesh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps Chanah was different, for she was very pained!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> We learn from "va'Ani... Avo Veisecha... b'Yir'asecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps David would afflict himself to arouse mercy, but others need not do so!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> We learn from "Hishtachavu la'Shem <i>b'Hadras</i> Kodesh" -- we read this "b'Cherdas" (with fear).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps we explain it like it is written, "b'Hadras," to teach that one should beautify himself for prayer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Yehudah would adorn himself with his garments before praying.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> We learn from "<i>Ivdu</i> Es Hash-m b'Yir'ah v'Gilu bi'Re'adah" (this refers to Avodah of the heart, i.e. prayer);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "v'Gilu bi'Re'adah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Where there is Gilah (rejoicing) there must be trembling.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rabah saw that Abaye was overly jovial -- he rebuked him, "It says, 'v'Gilu bi'Re'adah'!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> I am wearing Tefilin (so all can see that I have accepted the authority of my Master over me).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>R. Zeira saw that R. Yirmeyah was overly jovial -- he rebuked him, "b'Chol Etzev Yiheyeh Mosar"!</p>
