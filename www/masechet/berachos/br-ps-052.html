<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Beis Shamai does not hold that the Berachah on the day is more important!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> On Motza'i Shabbos one blesses on wine, light, spices, and Havdalah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he has only one cup, he [waits until after he eats, and] says all of them after Birkas ha'Mazon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this Beraisa is like Beis Hillel, not like Beis Shamai!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says that we bless on light before spices -- this is like Beis Shamai:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai agree that Birkas ha'Mazon is first, and Havdalah is last -- they argue about light before spices; Beis Shamai puts light first, Beis Hillel puts spices first.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do you know that the Beraisa is like Beis Shamai according to R. Yehudah? Perhaps it is Beis Hillel according to R. Meir (the Tana of our Mishnah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It cannot be like R. Meir -- in our Mishnah, Beis Shamai's order is light, Birkas ha'Mazon, spices, and Havdalah, Beis Hillel's order is light, spices, Birkas ha'Mazon, and Havdalah, but the Beraisa says that if he has only one cup, he says all the others after Birkas ha'Mazon!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The Beraisa is like Beis Shamai according to R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>Question (a) has not yet been answered!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beis Shamai distinguishes between [Kidush, at] the beginning of a [Kodesh] day from [Havdalah, at] the end of a day:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We like to start it (through Kidush) as soon as possible;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We like to end it (through Havdalah) as late as possible, so it should not seem that it is a burden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [In the Beraisa, why does Beis Shamai require leaving the wine for Birkas ha'Mazon?] Beis Shamai does not say that Birkas ha'Mazon requires a cup of wine!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If wine was brought during the meal, and there is enough only for one cup, [if he wants] he blesses on the wine, and afterwards Birkas ha'Mazon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He blesses on it and drinks it (and says Birkas ha'Mazon without a Kos)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, he blesses on it and leaves it [to say Birkas ha'Mazon on it].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learned that one who blesses must taste [from the food or drink]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, he tastes from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learned that one who tastes from a Kos is Pogem it (disqualifies it from being used for Birkas ha'Mazon, Kidush or Havdalah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [That is only if he drinks directly from the cup; here,] he takes some in his hand and tastes it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learned that a Kos Shel Berachah has a Shi'ur (Revi'is) -- if he tastes it, a Shi'ur will not remain!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, there was more than a Shi'ur to begin with.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It says, "If there is enough for only one cup"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There was not enough for two, but there was more than one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (of Answer #1 - R. Chiya - Beraisa):</span> He blesses on it and drinks it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Tana'im argue about the opinion of Beis Shamai.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CONCERN FOR <i>TUM'AH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> [First we wash...]</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Beis Shamai says, first we wash the hands, then we mix the wine -- we decree not to mix first, lest his hands will be Metamei water on the outside of the cup, and this will be Metamei the cup!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [Stam (unwashed) hands are considered Teme'im, and thus] even without liquid on the outside, Stam hands would be Metamei the cup!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Stam hands are considered a Sheni [l'Tum'ah], the only way a Sheni makes Chulin a Shelishi (or is Metamei a Kli) is through liquids. (Chachamim decreed that even a Sheni is Metamei liquids, and that Tamei liquids are Metamei Kelim, on account of Ma'ayanos (bodily fluids) of a Zav, which are Avos ha'Tum'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Beis Hillel says, first we mix the cup, then we wash the hands (we are not concerned if the outside of the cup becomes Tamei, for this is not Metamei the contents);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We decree not to wash first, lest the outside of the cup is Tamei, the hands will touch it while they are still wet, the cup will be Metamei them through the liquid, he will eat with Tamei hands!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if the hands are dry, the cup can be Metamei them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [We are concerned only for a cup that became Tamei through liquids -- the Halachah is that such] a cup is not Metamei a person.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Tamei cup is Metamei the liquid inside! (Why it is permitted to use a Tamei cup?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the outside of the cup became Tamei through liquids -- the inside is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Tamei liquid touched the outside of a vessel, the outside is Tamei, the inside, brim, and handles are Tehorim;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">52b----------------------------------------52b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If a Tamei liquid touched the inside, the entire vessel is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for their argument?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beis Shamai forbids using a cup whose outside became Tamei through liquids -- this is a decree, lest drops spill on the outside, which will be Metamei the hands;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>[Since we assume that the cup is Tahor,] there is no concern that the cup will be Metamei hands that are still wet (from washing).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel does not decree against using a cup whose outside became Tamei through liquids, for drops seldom spill on the outside;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since one may use a cup whose outside is Tamei, we are concerned lest the cup will be Metamei wet hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Also, one must eat immediately after washing the hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Beis Hillel need a second reason!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He addresses Beis Shamai according to Beis Shamai's reasoning:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You decree not to use a cup whose outside is Tamei, on account of drops -- nevertheless, you should agree that it is better to wash after mixing, for one must eat immediately after washing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> One cleans his hands...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> One cleans his hands with a napkin and leaves it on the table, for if he would leave it on the pillow, perhaps drops on the napkin will become Teme'im from the pillow, and they will be Metamei his hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The pillow itself could be Metamei the napkin!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Kli is not Metamei another Kli.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The pillow itself could be Metamei the person!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Kli is not Metamei a person.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel says, he leaves it on the pillow -- if he would leave it on the table, drops on the napkin might become Teme'im from the table and be Metamei the food.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The table itself should be Metamei the food on it!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the table is a Sheni l'Tum'ah, it is Metamei Chulin only through liquids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of their argument?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beis Shamai forbids using a table that is a Sheni [even for Chulin] -- this is a decree on account of people who eat Terumah (which is Mekabel Tum'ah from a Sheni);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel does not decree, for people who eat Terumah are zealous (they will remember not to eat Terumah on a table that is a Sheni);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Another reason -- mid'Oraisa, one need not wash his hands for Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Beis Hillel need a second reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He addresses a potential question of Beis Shamai:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If you will ask, why are we concerned about the food (and forbid putting the napkin on the table), but not about hands (perhaps the pillow will be Metamei them through drops on the napkin) -- mid'Oraisa, one need not wash his hands for Chulin (hands are Tahor as long as the person is Tahor), therefore it is better that the hands become Teme'im [mid'Rabanan] than food, which is Mekabel Tum'ah mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> First we clean...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> First we clean the place [where we ate], then we wash [Mayim Acharonim] -- if we would wash first, food could get ruined!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are concerned for crumbs (water might spill on them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Beis Hillel says that we wash first -- if the waiter is a Chacham, he will remove crumbs the size of a k'Zayis [or more] and leave those less than a k'Zayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>This supports R. Yochanan:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It is permitted to ruin crumbs less than a k'Zayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for their argument?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beis Hillel forbids using an ignoramus waiter, Beis Shamai permits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> The Halachah follows Beis Hillel in our entire Perek, except for this law, the Halachah follows Beis Shamai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span>R. Oshaya switches the opinions of Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai -- he holds that the Halachah follows Beis Hillel even in this law.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE BLESSING ON LIGHT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> [When using one cup of wine for Birkas ha'Mazon and Havdalah,] we bless on light, Birkas ha'Mazon...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rav Huna bar Yehudah visited Rava; Rava blessed on spices first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> They do not argue about light (all agree that we bless on it first)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> We bless on light, Birkas ha'Mazon, spices, and Havdalah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel says, we bless on light, spices, Birkas ha'Mazon, and Havdalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> That is according to R. Meir -- R. Yehudah says, all agree that Birkas ha'Mazon is first and Havdalah is last;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about light and spices -- Beis Shamai blesses first on light, Beis Hillel blesses first on spices.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> People follow Beis Hillel, according to R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> The text of the Berachah on light is "she'Bara Me'or ha'Esh";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> All agree that "Bara" connotes "created";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about "Borei" -- Beis Shamai says, it connotes "will be created"; Beis Hillel says, it also connotes "created." (Gra - they argue whether we bless over the creation of essence of light (which was one hue), or over the fire we kindle today (which contains many colors.))</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> [Surely, Beis Shamai agrees that "Borei" refers to things that were created, for the verses say,] "Yotzer Or v'Borei Choshech," "Yotzer Harim v'Borei Ru'ach," "Borei ha'Shamayim v'Noteihem"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Rather, all agree that "Bara" and "Borei" connote "created" -- they argue about "Me'or" and "Me'orei";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Shamai says that there is only one [hue of] light in a flame, Beis Hillel says that there are many.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Beis Hillel told Beis Shamai, "There are many lights (hues) in a flame."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may not bless [on light or spices of an idolater...]</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand why we may not bless on a light of an idolater -- it did not rest (Melachah was done with it on Shabbos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why may we not bless on spices of an idolater?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It refers to spices from a feast of idolaters -- we assume that the feast was for the sake of idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah forbids using light or spices of an idolater, of a Mes, and of idolatry -- this implies that "of an idolater" and "of idolatry" are different!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina of Sura):</span> It forbids using light or spices of an idolater <i>because</i> we assume that his feasts are for idolatry.</p>
