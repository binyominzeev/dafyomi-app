<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Hai Gaon):</span> Rav Huna ate 13 breads of Pas ha'Ba b'Kisnin, each was a third of a Kav, he did not bless [Birkas ha'Mazon] on them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Bahag):</span> Rav Huna ate 13 loaves, each was a third of a Kav, he did not bless on them (because he was not satiated). (End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> He ate these on account of hunger -- since others fix a meal on such an amount, he must bless on them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav Yehudah married his son to a daughter of Rav Yehudah bar Chaviva; he heard people of that family blessing ha'Motzi on Pas ha'Ba b'Kisnin, and was astounded.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Bei Rav Yehudah bar Chaviva:</span> Yes, we bless ha'Motzi!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Muna):</span> One blesses ha'Motzi on Pas ha'Ba b'Kisnin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Muna.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> Shmuel said that the Halachah <i>does not</i> follow R. Muna!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Bei Rav Yehudah bar Chaviva:</span> You yourself cited Shmuel to say that one may use Lachmaniyos to make an Eruv, and one blesses ha'Motzi on them! (Rashi defines Lachmaniyos as wafers or cakes (which he said earlier (41b) are considered Pas ha'Ba b'Kisnin); Tosfos defines them as very thin wafers.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> That is when one fixed his meal on them -- if not, he does not bless ha'Motzi.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FOOD AFTER THE MEAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rav Papa visited the home of Rav Huna brei d'Rav Nasan. After the meal, they were served more food; Rav Papa ate.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Bei Rav Huna:</span> Don't you hold that after the meal, it is forbidden to eat (until saying Birkas ha'Mazon)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> That is only if the bread was taken away.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rava and R. Zeira ate at the Reish Galusa's house; after the serving tray was removed, more portions were sent to them. Rava ate, R. Zeira did not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> Don't you hold that after the bread was taken away, it is forbidden to eat?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> We have intent to eat more in the event that the Reish Galusa will serve more to us (even after our tray was removed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one normally anoints his hands with oil after eating, his meal does not end until he does so (even if he finished eating and removed the tray, he may eat more without blessing).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> We normally anoint with oil after eating, our meal does not end before this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The Halachah does not follow these teachings, rather, it is like R. Chiya bar Ashi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Ashi):</span> There are three things that must be done immediately after something else without interruption:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Shechitah (the slaughtering of a Korban) must be right after Semichah, Tefilah (Shemoneh Esreh) must be right after [mentioning] Ge'ulah, one must bless [Birkas ha'Mazon] right after washing [Mayim Acharonim].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> There is something else that comes immediately -- right after hosting a Chacham, a Ba'al ha'Bayis will be blessed, as it says, "va'Yevarcheni Hash-m Biglalecha";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Alternatively, we can learn this from "va'Yevarech Hash-m Es Beis ha'Mitzri Biglal Yosef."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN DOES A BLESSING FOR ONE FOOD EXEMPT OTHER FOODS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one blessed on wine before the meal, this exempts wine after the meal;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one blessed on appetizers before the meal, this exempts appetizers after the meal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one blessed on bread, this exempts appetizers; if one blessed on appetizers, this does not exempt bread;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Shamai says, it does not exempt even cooked foods (of grain).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If people were sitting (not reclining on beds, which was the usual practice while eating), everyone blesses for himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they reclined, one blesses for everyone.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">42b----------------------------------------42b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If wine was brought during the meal, everyone blesses for himself; after the meal, one person blesses for everyone;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The same person blesses on the incense, even though it is brought after the meal (after Birkas ha'Mazon).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> This is only on Shabbos and Yom Tov, for a person bases his meal on wine, but on a weekday, he blesses on every cup.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Mari citing R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> This is only on Shabbos and Yom Tov or after a person leaves the bathhouse or lets blood, for then he bases his meal on wine -- at other times, he blesses on every cup.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rabah bar Mari visited Rava's house on a weekday; he saw him bless on wine before the meal and after the meal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> Very nice -- R. Yehoshua ben Levi says to do so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yitzchak bar Yosef visited Abaye on Yom Tov, he saw him bless on every cup.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">R. Yitzchak:</span> Do you argue with R. Yehoshua ben Levi?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> No -- [each time] I had decided not to drink any more, therefore I needed a new blessing when I reconsidered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If wine was brought in the middle of a meal, will [the blessing on] it exempt wine after the meal?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps [the blessing on] wine before a meal exempts wine after the meal because both of them are for the sake of drinking -- but wine during the meal is to soak the food, it does not exempt wine for the sake of drinking;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps in both cases it exempts wine after the meal?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav and Rav Nachman):</span> It exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Kahana, Rav Sheshes... and all Talmidei Rav):</span> It does not exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava, against Rav Nachman - Mishnah):</span> If wine was brought during the meal, everyone blesses for himself; after the meal, one person blesses for everyone (even though they blessed during the meal)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> It means, if wine was not brought during the meal, but rather after the meal, one person blesses for everyone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one blessed on bread, this exempts appetizers; if one blessed on appetizers, this does not exempt bread;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Shamai says, it does not even exempt cooked foods.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Beis Shamai argue with the Reisha, or with the Seifa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps Beis Shamai argues with the Reisha -- the first Tana said that if one blessed on bread, this exempts appetizers, and all the more so cooked foods;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Beis Shamai says, it does not even exempt cooked foods.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps Beis Shamai argues with the Seifa -- the first Tana said that if one blessed on appetizers, this does not exempt bread, but it does exempt cooked foods;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Beis Shamai says, it does not even exempt cooked foods.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHEN MAY ONE BLESS FOR EVERYONE ELSE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If people were sitting, everyone blesses for himself; [if they reclined, one blesses for everyone].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> One blesses for everyone only because they were reclining.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If ten people were travelling, even if all eat from the same loaf, everyone must bless for himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they sat to eat, even if everyone eats from his own loaf, one person blesses for everyone.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It suffices that they sit, they need not recline!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The case is, they said, "Let us go eat bread in Ploni (a certain place)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>When Rav died, his Talmidim went to [another city] where he was buried; upon returning, they said, "Let's eat bread on the Danak River."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav's Talmidim):</span> Does the Mishnah allow one to bless for everyone only if they recline, or is saying, "Let's go eat bread in Ploni," as good as reclining?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They could not answer this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rav Ada bar Ahavah reversed his cloak (so the side he had torn over the death of Rav was now in back) and tore again (what was now in front) -- "Rav died, and we do not even know the laws of Birkas ha'Mazon!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>An elder came, asked the above contradiction, and answered like Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak.</p>
