<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was served salted food and bread, he blesses on the salted food and exempts the bread, for it is secondary to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The general rule is, if one eats a primary and a secondary food together, he blesses only on the primary, this exempts the secondary.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Do we ever find that salted food is primary and bread is secondary?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Avira):</span> The Mishnah discusses the fruits of Ginosar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>(Rashi - they are more important than bread. (They are very sweet, they are normally eaten salted.). Tosfos - it discusses one who became weak from eating the fruits of Ginosar, now he primarily wants to eat salted food to recover.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> When we followed R. Yochanan to eat fruits of Ginosar:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there were 100 of us, everyone would take 10 fruits for him; if there were 10 of us, everyone would take 100 (in any case, we took 1000 for him).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A hundred fruits (Maharshal - did not) fit into a three-Se'ah basket;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He ate them, and swore that he did not taste Ziyuna (anything).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he swore that he did not taste Mazona (anything satiating).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Avahu ate fruits of Ginosar until flies would slip off his face (his face glowed and became very smooth).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Ami and R. Asi ate fruits of Ginosar until their hair fell out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Reish Lakish ate them until he became crazed; R. Yochanan told the Nasi's house, and R. Yehudah Nesi'ah sent masses of people to return Reish Lakish to his house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> Yanai ha'Melech had a city in Har ha'Melech, it would send 600,000 bowls of tuna (i.e. cut) fish every week to feed workers picking figs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> Yanai ha'Melech had a tree in Har ha'Melech, three times every month they would take from it 40 Se'ah of newly born birds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> In Gufnis (a city in Eretz Yisrael) there were 80 pairs of brothers who were Kohanim married to sisters, the daughters of Kohanim (there must have been an awesome number of people for this to occur so often);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In Bavel, they checked from Sura until Neharde'a and found only one pair <i>close to</i> this, Rav Chisda's daughters were married to Rami and Mar Ukva bar Chama;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The sisters were daughters of a Kohen, the brothers were not Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> A meal without salt is not a [proper] meal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> A meal without a cooked food with liquid is not a [proper] meal.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BLESSINGS OF THE SEVEN SPECIES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Gamliel):</span> If one ate grapes, figs or pomegranates, he says three blessings (Birkas ha'Mazon);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, he says one Berachah me'Ein Shalosh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Akiva says, even if he fixed his meal on Shelakos (cooked vegetables), he says three blessings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>One who drinks water on account of thirst blesses sheha'Kol;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Tarfon says, he blesses Borei Nefashos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does R. Gamliel require Birkas ha'Mazon for all seven species?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says, "Eretz Chitah u'Se'orah v'Gefen u'Se'enah v'Rimon Eretz Zeis Shemen u'Devash," and it says, "Eretz Asher Lo v'Miskenus Tochal Bah Lechem... v'Achalta v'Savata u'Verachta."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Chachamim argue, for "Eretz" in the middle interrupts [between the seven species and Birkas ha'Mazon, therefore it is required only for bread].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Gamliel should agree that "Eretz" interrupts!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He expounds "Eretz" to exempt one who eats raw wheat (the obligation for wheat and barley is only if they were made into bread).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yakov bar Idi):</span> One blesses Borei Minei Mezonos before eating anything from the five grains, and me'Ein Shalosh afterwards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Mari):</span> One blesses Borei Pri ha'Etz before eating any of the seven species (other than grain), and me'Ein Shalosh afterwards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> What is me'Ein Shalosh?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> For fruits, it is "Al ha'Etz v'Al Pri ha'Etz... Ki Atah Tov u'Metiv la'Kol";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For the five grains, it is "Al ha'Michyah v'Al ha'Kalkalah..."; the blessing closes "Al ha'Aretz v'Al ha'Michyah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the blessing [for fruits] close?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Dimi taught that on Rosh Chodesh, we close [the middle blessing of Musaf] "Baruch [Atah Hash-m] Mekadesh Yisrael v'Roshei Chodashim" (even though normally, we do not close a blessing with two praises (49a);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Here (for fruits), may we close similarly (e.g. "Al ha'Aretz v'Al ha'Peiros")?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>(Gra deletes (1) and (2), presumably because we already know that for grains we close "Al ha'Aretz v'Al ha'Michyah." Meromei Sadeh - we cannot learn from those, for the ability to grow grain is a primary praise of Eretz Yisrael, it is essentially one praise, like the end of the second blessing of Birkas ha'Mazon, "Al ha'Aretz v'Al ha'Mazon.")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> We close "Al ha'Aretz v'Al Peiroseha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> We close "Al ha'Aretz v'Al ha'Peiros."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Amram):</span> They do not argue -- each gives the text for [people in] his area, Rav Chisda for Bavel, R. Yochanan for Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Objection: (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> This is unreasonable -- in Bavel, why should we bless for <i>its</i> (Eretz Yisrael's) fruits?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Rav Chisda says that we close "Al ha'Aretz v'Al ha'Peiros," R. Yochanan says that we close "Al ha'Aretz v'Al Peiroseha."</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi):</span> On eggs and all kinds of meat one blesses beforehand sheha'Kol and afterwards Borei Nefashos, but one does not bless afterwards for Yerek (vegetables);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> One blesses afterwards even for Yerek, but not for water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> One blesses afterwards even for water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Mar Zutra followed R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi, Rav Simi Bar Ashi followed R. Yitzchak;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A way to remember who followed whom -- the one called by one name followed the one called by two (his and his father's) names, and vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> When I remember, I follow all of them (I bless even for water).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Anything that requires a blessing afterwards requires a blessing beforehand, but there is something that requires a blessing beforehand but does not require a blessing afterwards.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand this according to R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi and R. Yitzchak -- this refers to Yerek or water, it requires a Berachah Rishonah, but not a Berachah Acharonah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But how does Rav Papa explain this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It refers to Mitzvos (we bless beforehand, not afterwards).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In Eretz Yisrael, after removing Tefilin they bless "Asher Kidshanu b'Mitzvosav v'Tzivanu Lishmor Chukav" -- what does the Mishnah exempt (from a Berachah Acharonah)?</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE MOST BENEFICIAL FOODS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> There is nothing the size of an egg which is as beneficial as an egg.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> A lightly roasted egg is better than six Lugim (a Log is the volume of six eggs) of fine flour.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> A lightly roasted egg is better than six Lugim (of flour); a hard roasted egg is better than four Lugim, an egg cooked (in water) is better than anything cooked, except for meat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> Even if he fixed his meal on Shelakos...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do people fix a meal on cooked vegetables?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> He refers to cabbage stalks (they give sustenance).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Spleen is good for the teeth but bad for the intestines, leeks are bad for the teeth but good for the intestines;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Any raw Yerek makes one pale, anything small (that did not grow enough) makes one smaller, any living thing eaten whole (after death, e.g. small fish) revitalizes a person, anything close to an animal's life source (this will be explained) revitalizes a person.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Cabbage is for sustenance, beets are for healing; woe to the "house" (i.e. stomach) through which turnips pass!</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [This is before people normally eat,] the smell is harmful (to someone who has not eaten yet).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> It is forbidden to eat raw Yerek within the first four hours of the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Raw Yerek was brought in front of Ameimar, Mar Zutra and Rav Ashi within the first four hours of the day; Ameimar and Rav Ashi ate it, Mar Zutra did not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Ameimar and Rav Ashi:</span> Do you refrain because R. Yitzchak forbids talking with one who ate Yerek within four hours, on account of smell? We ate, yet you are talking with us!</p>
