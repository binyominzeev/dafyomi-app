<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO LOST HIS PLACE WHILE SAYING SHEMA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said it out of order, he was not Yotzei... [if one erred...]</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(A reciter of Beraisos):</span> If one erred (while saying Shema) and does not know exactly where:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was in the middle of a Perek, he should return to the beginning of that Perek;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he was between Perakim, he should begin with the second Perek;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he knows that he must say "u'Chesavtam," but is unsure which, he returns to "u'Chesavtam" in the first Perek;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This is only if he did not begin to say "Lema'an Yirbu Yemeichem" -- but if he began to say this, we assume that he said it as he normally does (and he finished the second Perek).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LENIENCIES FOR WORKERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Workers may say Shema on top of a tree or wall, but they may not pray there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A Chasan is exempt from Shema from the wedding night until Motzei Shabbos, if he did not yet have relations;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Gamliel said Shema on his wedding night; his Talmidim asked, "You taught that a Chasan is exempt!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> I refuse to exempt myself from accepting Ol Malchus Shamayim, even for a moment!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Workers may say Shema on top of a tree or wall; they may pray on top of an olive tree or fig tree;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>From any other tree, they must come down to pray.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>A Ba'al ha'Bayis (one who does not work for someone else) must come down from any tree to pray, for his mind is not settled on top.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mari - Mishnah):</span> Workers may say Shema on top of a tree or wall;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This implies that intent is not needed for Shema;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> Intent is required for Shema -- it says "Shema Yisrael," similar to "Haskes u'Shema Yisrael";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like there it refers to intent, also here!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rava could not answer; he asked Rav Mari if he had heard anything about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Mari citing Rav Sheshes):</span> Workers cease working so that they can say Shema with intent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - Beis Hillel):</span> We may say Shema while working.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They cease working to read the first Perek (for it needs intent), they may read the second Perek while working (it does not need intent).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>(Tzelach - we do not resolve the contradiction (i:2) this way, for if the Mishnah allows workers to say only the second Perek of Shema on a wall, it should distinguish between the Perakim of Shema, rather than between Shema and Tefilah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> One who works for someone else says Shema with the Berachos before and after, says the Berachos before and after eating, and prays Shemoneh Esreh, but he may not lead the prayer nor recite Birkas Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> He prays an abridged form of Shemoneh Esreh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> Beraisa #1 is like R. Gamliel, Beraisa #2 is like R. Yehoshua.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Yehoshua permits anyone to say the abridged Shemoneh Esreh, not only workers!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #2:</span> Rather, both are like R. Gamliel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beraisa #2 discusses a worker who receives wages (and a meal), Beraisa #1 discusses a worker who receives only a meal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> One working for someone else says Shema and prays;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He eats bread without blessing beforehand, but he makes two Berachos afterwards;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The first Berachah (ha'Zan) is like normal, then he begins Birkas ha'Aretz, and includes in it Boneh Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This applies to a worker who receives wages, but if he receives only a meal, or if the employer eats with him, he says the full Birkas ha'Mazon.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PEOPLE EXEMPT FROM SHEMA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Chasan is exempt from Shema.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "B'Shivtecha b'Veisecha" -- this exempts one engaged in a Mitzvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Uv'Lechtecha va'Derech" -- this exempts a Chasan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This exempts one who marries a virgin, and obligates one who marries a widow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we learn this from the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Sitting in your house (i.e. the time when you are obligated) is equated to going on the road;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like going on the road is Reshus (voluntary), the obligation to say Shema applies only when one is engaged in Reshus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the Torah obligates even one who is travelling to do a Mitzvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it should have said "b'Leches";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, "uv'Lechte<i>cha</i>" refers to when you are pursuing your pursuing your own affairs, but one engaged in a Mitzvah is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even one who marries a widow should be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One who marries a virgin is distracted (he cannot concentrate), one who marries a widow is not distracted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If distraction exempts, then one who heard that his ship sank should be exempt (but this is not so)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Zavda):</span> An Avel (mourner) is obligated in all Mitzvos except for Tefilin, for Tefilin are called "Pe'er" (glory) -- "Pe'ercha Chavosh Alecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Distraction of a Mitzvah (such as a Chasan) exempts, distraction of Reshus (a loss of money, or mourning) does not.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CONDUCT OF MOURNING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Gamliel bathed on the night after his wife died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">His Talmidim:</span> But you taught us that a mourner is forbidden to bathe (for seven days)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> I am an exception, I am an Istenis (not bathing causes pain to me).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>When R. Gamliel's slave Tavi died, he accepted consolation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">His Talmidim:</span> But you taught us that we do not accept consolation for slaves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> Tavi was not a regular slave, he was proper.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If a Chasan wants to say Shema on the first night, he may;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, not everyone is fitting to flaunt his piety.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is R. Gamliel's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that Aveilus (mourning) on the night after death is only mid'Rabanan -- "va'Acharisah k'Yom Mar" (mid'Oraisa, it is only during the day);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim did not decree to forbid an Istenis (to bathe).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When his slave Tavi died...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When a slave dies, we do not make a line (to console mourners), say Birkas Aveilim, or say consolation of mourners (lest people will think that the family of the deceased has proper lineage);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When R. Eliezer's slave died, his Talmidim came to console him. To avoid them, he went to the attic, then to the reception room and to the banquet room -- they kept following him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> You don't know how to take a hint! I taught you, when a slave dies, we do not make a line (to console mourners), say Birkas Aveilim, or say consolation of mourners;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, we relate to it as if an animal died -- "Hash-m should replace your loss."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not eulogize slaves;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>R. Yosi says, we say about a proper slave, "He was good, trustworthy and ate from his own labor."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> If so, what more can we say about proper Yisraelim?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are only three Avos (patriarchs) and four Imahos (matriarchs).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we say that there are only three Avos (and exclude the Shevatim) -- because most people (except for Leviyim) do not know if they are from Shevet Reuven or Shimon...?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We count four Imahos, even though most people do not know if they are from Rachel or from Leah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Avos were more important.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not call slaves "Aba Ploni" or "Ima Plonis" (Me'iri - lest people will think that the slave has proper lineage; Shitah Mekubetzes -- lest people will think that the one who says this is the son of the slave).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span>Slaves of R. Gamliel's house were called this way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This contradicts the Halachah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(v)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They were more important (Me'iri - the slaves were well known; Shitah - R. Gamliel's household), therefore the above concern did not apply.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>REQUESTS AFTER PRAYER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Ken Avarechecha v'Chayai" -- this refers to Keri'as Shema; "b'Shimcha Esa Chapai" -- this refers to Tefilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one does so, "Kemo Chelev va'Deshen Tisba Nafshi" (it is as if he offered a Korban).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Additionally, he inherits two worlds, this world and the World to Come -- "v'Sifsei <i>Renanos</i> Yehalel Pi."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>After R. Elazar finished Shemoneh Esreh, he would say "Yehi Ratzon... that You will cause to dwell in our portion love, brotherhood, and peace; and fill our borders with disciples... and put our portion in Gan Eden... give us good colleagues... help our heart to desire to fear Your name."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yochanan (after Shemoneh Esreh) would request from Hash-m to look at our shame and troubles, and arouse His mercy, kindness, and humility.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Zeira would request from Hash-m to help us avoid sin, and not be shamed and embarrassed from (Aruch - more than) our fathers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Chiya would request that Torah be our expertise, that our hope not falter and that our vision not wane.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rav would request that we have long life of peace, goodness, blessing, income, health, fear of sin, free of shame, life of honor and wealth, fear of Shamayim, and that our requests be answered for the good.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rebbi would request from Hash-m to save us from brazen people and brazenness, from evil people and evil happenings, the Yetzer ha'Ra, an evil companion or neighbor, an inciting Satan, a harsh judgment or harsh opponent, whether Yisrael or Nochri;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He requested this even though the emperor's guards watched over him.</p>
