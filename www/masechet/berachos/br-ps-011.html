<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW AND WHEN TO SAY SHEMA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Beis Hillel explains his verse and that of Beis Shamai, but how does Beis Shamai resolve both verses?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the verse intends to teach about the time to say Shema, it should have said "ba'Erev uva'Boker";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, "uv'Shochbecha uv'Kumecha" means, when you <i>actually</i> lie down and rise.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Beis Shamai learn from "uv'Lechtecha va'Derech"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "B'Shivtecha b'Veisecha" -- this exempts someone engaged in a Mitzvah (this entire Beraisa will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Uv'Lechtecha va'Derech" exempts a Chasan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is the source to exempt one who marries a virgin, and obligate one who marries a widow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we learn this from the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Sitting in your house (i.e. the time when you are obligated) is equated to going on the road;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like going on the road is Reshus (voluntary, and not a Mitzvah), the obligation to say Shema applies only when one is engaged in a voluntary activity (and not in another Mitzvah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the Torah obligates even one who is traveling to do a Mitzvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it should have said "b'Sheves" and "uv'Leches";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, "b'Shivte<i>cha</i>" and "uv'Lechte<i>cha</i>" refer to when you are pursuing your own affairs, but one engaged in a Mitzvah is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even one who marries a widow should be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One who marries a virgin is distracted (he cannot concentrate), one who marries a widow is not distracted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If distraction exempts, then one who heard that his ship sank should be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps that is true!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Aba bar Zavda taught that an Avel (mourner) is obligated in all Mitzvos except for Tefilin, for Tefilin are called "Pe'er" (glory) -- "Pe'ercha Chavosh Alecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Distraction of a Mitzvah (such as a Chasan) exempts, distraction of Reshus (a loss of money, or mourning) does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Beis Shamai exempts one engaged in a Mitzvah from "uv'Lechtecha" -- what do they learn from "va'Derech"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That exempts someone on the way to do a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Beis Hillel agrees with these exemptions; however, they also infer that one who is on the way to a Reshus says Shema while going.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE WAY TO SAY SHEMA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Hillel):</span> We may say Shema while standing, sitting, reclining, walking on the road, or working;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A case occurred, R. Yishmael and R. Elazar ben Azaryah were sitting together, R. Yishmael was reclining and R. Elazar was erect; when the time for Shema came, R. Elazar reclined and R. Yishmael sat erect.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> You resemble a man who was praised for his nice long beard, and responded, "I will shave it off"!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>At first, I was erect and you were reclining; when the time for Shema arrived, I reclined like you, and you sat erect!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> I did like Beis Hillel, you did like Beis Shamai;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Also, perhaps Talmidim will see [us both reclining] and this will become the accepted Halachah for generations!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he need the second reason ("Also...")?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps you will say that Beis Hillel also permits reclining -- but this is only if one was already reclining;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since you were erect until now, and now you reclined, onlookers will think that the Halachah follows Beis Shamai, perhaps this will become the Halachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yechezkeil - Beraisa):</span> If one did like Beis Shamai, he was Yotzei (fulfilled his obligation); if one did like Beis Hillel, he was Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> If one did like Beis Shamai, he was not Yotzei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If the head and majority of a man are in a Sukah, and his table is in the house, it (the Sukah) is Pasul;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel is Machshir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Beis Hillel:</span> A case occurred, elders of Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel visited R. Yochanan ben ha'Choranis; his head and majority were in the Sukah, his table was in the house, and they did not comment about this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Beis Shamai:</span> No, they told him, "If you have always done so, then you have never fulfilled the Mitzvah!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>(Just like Beis Shamai says that one is not Yotzei in a Sukah that Beis Hillel is Machshir, Beis Hillel says that one who says Keri'as Shema like Beis Shamai is not Yotzei!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> If one did like Beis Shamai, he is Chayav Misah (bi'Yedei Shamayim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Tarfon):</span> I was on the road and lied down to say Shema, like Beis Shamai -- I endangered myself on account of bandits.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> You were liable to die for transgressing Beis Hillel's opinion!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE BLESSINGS BEFORE AND AFTER SHEMA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In the morning one says two Berachos before Shema and one afterwards, in the evening one says two Berachos before Shema and two afterwards;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One of them (of the two afterwards) is long, the other is short;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Where Chachamim said that a long Berachah should be said, one may not say a short Berachah, and vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Where Chachamim said to be Chosem (to end the Berachah with "Baruch..."), one must do so; where they said not to be Chosem, one may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What Berachos does one say (before the morning Shema)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer -- part 1 (R. Yakov):</span> One Berachah is "Yotzer Or u'Vorei Choshech..."</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> Rather, we should say, "Yotzer Or u'Vorei Nogah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We follow the wording of the verse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, we should conclude, "Oseh Shalom u'Vorei Ra"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, we say "[u'Vorei] ha'Kol" as a euphemism for "Ra" -- likewise, we should say "Nogah" (light) in place of "Choshech"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> We say "u'Vorei Choshech" for we want to mention the attribute of day at night, and the attribute of night during the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, "u'Vorei Choshech" fulfills mentioning the attribute of night during the day;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Where do we mention the attribute of day at night?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> We say "Golel Or Mipnei Choshech v'Choshech Mipnei Or."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the second Berachah before Shema?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah and R. Elazar):</span> It is Ahavah Rabah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> We do not say "Ahavas Olam," rather, "Ahavah Rabah";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabanan):</span> We say "Ahavas Olam," as it is written, "v'Ahavas Olam Ahavtich."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>BIRKAS HA'TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one wakes up to learn before saying Keri'as Shema, he must bless (Birkas ha'Torah); if he already said Keri'as Shema, he does not bless, for Ahavah Rabah exempts him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> One must bless for learning Mikra (Torah, Nevi'im or Kesuvim), but not for Midrash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> One must bless for Mikra or Midrash, but not for Mishnah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One must bless even for Mishnah, but not for Talmud (the reasons for the laws in the Mishnayos, and resolutions of the contradictions between them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One must bless even for Talmud.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Ashi):</span> Many times I sat in front of Rav to learn Sifra d'Vei Rav (Midrash); he would wash his hands, bless and teach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(Ritva (14b) - this supports R. Elazar, who says that one must bless for Medrash. Rashash assumes that it supports Rava -- perhaps they learned explanations on the Midrash, similar to Talmud. Alternatively, "Sifra d'Vei Rav" should be deleted from the text.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the text of the blessing?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is "Asher Kidshanu b'Mitzvosav v'Tzivanu La'asok b'Divrei Sorah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yochanan would conclude, "Ha'arev Na... Divrei Sorascha b'Finu... Baruch Atah Hash-m ha'Melamed Torah l'Amo Yisrael."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Hamnuna):</span> It is "Asher Bachar Banu mi'Kol ha'Amim v'Nasan Lanu Es Toraso, Baruch Atah Hash-m Nosen ha'Torah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna; Rif's text - the Gemara itself says this):</span> This is the greatest Berachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Therefore, one should say all of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An appointed Kohen would tell them (the Kohanim of the Mishmar) to say one Berachah (before Shema); they said one Berachah, Aseres ha'Dibros, Shema, v'Hayah Im Shamo'a, va'Yomer, and blessed (with the people - Rosh deletes this from the text) three Berachos -- Emes v'Yatziv, [the Berachah of Retzeh on account of the] Avodah, and Birkas Kohanim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On Shabbos, an extra Berachah was given to the departing Mishmar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which one Berachah did they say before Shema?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> It was Ahavah Rabah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Zerika):</span> It was Yotzer Or.</p>
