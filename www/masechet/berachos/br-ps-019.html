<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SPEAKING AGAINST CHACHAMIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Speaking [bad things] about a Mes is like speaking about a rock.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> This is because they do not know what is said.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Even though they know what is said, they do not care.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rav Papa related that someone spoke badly about Shmuel, and his roof caved in and split his skull!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m defends the honor of Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> One who says bad things about a Mes falls to Gehinom -- "veha'Matim Akalkalosam Yolichem Hash-m Es Po'alei ha'Aven," he will be with Resha'im (in Gehinom);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is even when "Shalom Al Yisrael" (i.e. the one spoken cannot quarrel with the speaker, for the former is dead).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> If you see a Chacham sin at night, do not suspect him the next day, perhaps he repented.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> He cannot mean "perhaps"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, certainly he repented.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This does not apply if he owes money for what he did -- then, the Teshuvah is not complete until he returns the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Beis Din excommunicates for the honor of Chachamim (or their enactments) in 24 cases, all are learned in Mishnayos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Elazar asked where; R. Yehoshua told him to investigate. He found three -- disrespect for Netilas Yadayim (the enactment to wash the hands), saying bad things about a deceased Chacham, and acting haughtily towards Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Disparaging a dead Chacham -) (Mishnah):</span> Akavya ben Mahalal'el used to say that a convert or freed slave may not drink Sotah water (the Torah refers to "Bnei Yisrael");</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> A case occurred, Shemayah and Avtalyon ordered that a freed slave drink Sotah water!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Akavya:</span> They gave Dugma to drink (Rashi - someone like themselves; they were descended from converts, and wanted to demonstrate that converts are important like Yisraelim; Aruch - they gave her imitation Sotah water, to scare her into admitting).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim excommunicated Akavya for saying this, and stoned his coffin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> Heaven forbid [to say that this occurred]! There was no one as great in wisdom, purity, and fear of sin as Akavya!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, they excommunicated Elazar ben Chanoch for disgracing Netilas Yadayim; when he died, they put a rock on his coffin.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>This is done to anyone who dies in Niduy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Acting haughtily towards Hash-m -) (Mishnah):</span> (The Jews had asked Choni ha'Me'agel to pray for rain; Choni was very particular about how Hash-m should fulfill his request.) Shimon ben Shetach sent to Choni, "You are worthy of Niduy -- if you were not Choni, I would excommunicate you! However, I see that you grumble in front of Hash-m, and he does your will like a father does for a son!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I apply to you the verse, "Yismach Avicha v'Imecha..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There are more cases! (Why could R. Elazar find only three?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> Tudus Ish Romi accustomed Jews in Rome to eat goats roasted whole on Pesach night. Shimon ben Shetach sent to him, "You are worthy of Niduy! If you were not Tudus, I would excommunicate you, for the Chachamim forbade this, lest people will think that we may eat Kodshim outside the Mikdash!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He found only three cases in the <i>Mishnayos</i>, that case is in a Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There are more cases in the Mishnayos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (If an oven became Tamei, one may dismantle it into rings in order to make it Tahor.) If the rings were connected with mud (without firing it in a kiln), this is the oven of "Achnai":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer says, it is not Mekabel Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, it is Mekabel Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> It is called "Achnai" because Chachamim surrounded the oven like an Achnai (snake) with proofs that it is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> That day, they took all the food that was Tahor according to R. Eliezer (and Tamei according to Chachamim) and burned it in front of him; they voted and excommunicated him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah itself does not say that they excommunicated him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are the other cases to which R. Yehoshua ben Levi refers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehoshua extrapolates (wherever he finds lack of respect for Chachamim, he says that it is worthy of Niduy);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Elazar found only three, for he does not extrapolate.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHO IS EXEMPT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The law of those carrying the coffin, Chilufeihem...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not begin to take a Mes to be buried close to the time of Keri'as Shema; if they began, we do not interrupt for Shema;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> They began to take Rav Yosef to be buried close to the time of Shema!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The law is different for a great person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Those in front of the coffin and in back...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Those engaging in eulogies:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Mes is in front of them, they slip away one at a time to say Shema;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the Mes is not front of them, they all say Shema together, the mourner is silent; they stand for Tefilah, he stands and says Tziduk ha'Din (justifies Hash-m's decree);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He says, "Hash-m, I sinned greatly in front of You, You did not punish me one part in 1000; may it be Your will to fence our breaches and those of all Yisrael with mercy."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> A person should not speak like this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> A person should not incite the Satan (by mentioning that he is worthy of punishment)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> He learns from "Kim'at ki'Sedom Hayinu" -- after we equated ourselves to Sedom, the Navi responded, "Shim'u Devar Hash-m Ketzinei Sedom."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> After the burial...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If they can <i>complete</i> Shema before reaching the Shurah, they should begin; if not, not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> After the burial, if they can complete even one chapter or even one verse, they begin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Indeed, that is what the Mishnah means;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After the burial, if they can complete even one chapter or verse, they begin; if not, not.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Those in the Shurah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Those on the inside are exempt, those on the outside are obligated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>R. Yehudah says, those who came to console are exempt, those who came on account of curiosity are obligated.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>KAVOD HA'BERIYOS</i> OVERRIDES A LAV</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text) (Beraisa):</span> If one finds Sha'atnez in his garment, even in the market, he must take it off.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rambam):</span> If one finds Sha'atnez in someone else's garment, even in the market, he tears it off. (End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ein Chachmah v'Ein Tevunah v'Ein Etzah l'Neged Hash-m" -- wherever desecration of Hash-m's name is involved, we do not give honor to an important person (to leave the garment on him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If an Avel was returning from burying his Mes on a Tamei path, Kohanim may accompany him, even if there is also a Tahor path, because of his honor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We should say, "Ein Chachmah... l'Neged Hash-m"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> The path was a Beis ha'Pras (a field in which a grave was plowed, we are concerned that the plow dragged bones and spread them throughout the field), its Tum'ah is only mid'Rabanan (we are concerned that one who walks there may touch or move a bone k'Se'orah, the size of a barley seed).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A person may walk through a Beis ha'Pras by bending down and blowing [the dirt before each step, so that he will see any small bones that might be there].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah bar Ashi):</span> If many people walked through a Beis ha'Pras, it is Tahor (we assume that any bones have been crushed to less than k'Se'orah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>(If Tum'as Beis ha'Pras was mid'Oraisa, Chachamim could not allow these leniencies.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok taught, we (Kohanim) used to go over coffins to see Jewish kings, and even Nochri kings, so that if we merit, we will perceive the difference between Malchei Yisrael (Mashi'ach) and Nochri kings.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We should say, "Ein Chachmah..."!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava taught, mid'Oraisa, Tum'as Mes does not penetrate through a roof that is at least one Tefach above it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The cover of most coffins is one Tefach above the Mes; Chachamim decreed that one who passes over any coffin is Tamei, on account of those without a Tefach above the Mes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>On account of the honor of kings, they did not decree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Kavod ha'Beriyos (human dignity) overrides [any] Lav of the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We should say, "Ein Chachmah..."!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav bar Sheva):</span> It overrides only the Lav of Lo Sasur (do not turn from what the Chachamim say).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael laughed at this -- (Lo Sasur includes all of the interpretations of the Mitzvos,] if so, one may transgress any Lav!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rav Kahana:</span> Do not laugh at anything a great Chacham says! All mid'Rabanan laws are based on Lo Sasur, Chachamim said that Kavod ha'Beriyos overrides their laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "V'His'alamta Mehem" -- sometimes you are to ignore the lost object, sometimes you may not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Kohen ignores a lost object in a cemetery, a Chacham ignores it if it is below his dignity to carry such an item, a worker ignores it if the wages he will lose if he returns it are more than it is worth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We should say, "Ein Chachmah..."!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is different, for it says explicitly "v'His'alamta."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should learn from here that Kavod ha'Beriyos overrides every other Lav mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not learn Isurim (like Sha'atnez) from monetary laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa) Question:</span> "Ul'Achoso" -- what does this teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If someone (Tosfos; Rashi - the Kohen Gadol, who was a Nazir) was going to slaughter his Korban Pesach or circumcise his son and he heard that a relative died, one might have thought that he should be Metamei (become Tamei to help bury the relative, even though this will prevent him from fulfilling the Mitzvah of Pesach (or Milah on the eighth day)) -- the Torah says "Lo Yitama";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps, just as he is not Metamei for relatives, he is not Metamei for a Mes Mitzvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ul'Achoso" -- only for relative is he not Metamei, but he is Metamei for a Mes Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> We should say, "Ein Chachmah..."!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is different, for it says "Ul'Achoso."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should learn from here that Kavod ha'Beriyos overrides every Lav mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This applies only to a passive transgression (wearing Sha'atnez is considered an action).</p>
