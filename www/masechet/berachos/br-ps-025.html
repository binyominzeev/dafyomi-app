<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If one forgot to remove his Tefilin before entering a Beis ha'Kisei, he should put his hand over them until he finishes.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Clarification:</span> He must mean like Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak said, until the first Amud (piece) is excreted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should stop right away and arise!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He does not stop, due to R. Shimon ben Gamliel's teaching:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> If excrement starts to leave the body and returns, this causes Hadrokan (in which the stomach swells);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one does not urinate when he must, this causes jaundice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> [Even] if excrement is on one's body, or if his hand is inside (the wall around) a Beis ha'Kisei, he may say Shema;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> He may not say Shema.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rav Huna learns from "Kol ha'Neshamah Tehalel Kah" (the respiratory organs (nose and mouth) praise Hash-m, we are not concerned for the cleanliness of the rest of the body);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Rav Chisda learns from "Kol Atzmosai Tomarnah Hash-m Mi Chamocha" (all the limbs praise Hash-m).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If there is a bad smell she'Yesh Lo Ikar (with a source, e.g. excrement), one must distance himself four Amos (from the source);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> He must distance himself four Amos from where the smell ends.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Chisda - Beraisa):</span> One may not say Shema facing excrement of people, dogs, pigs, or chickens, or a foul smelling wasteheap;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was ten Tefachim above or below him, he may say Shema next to it; if not, he must distance himself until he cannot see it.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If there is a bad smell she'Yesh Lo Ikar, one must distance himself four Amos from the smell.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah does not follow this Beraisa, rather, it is follows a different Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not say Shema facing human excrement, nor that of dogs or pigs if hide was put in (to be tanned).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the law regarding a bad smell she'Ein Lo Ikar?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> Look at the mattresses of the [Talmidim who study in the] Beis Medrash; some Talmidim learn while others sleep (and pass wind);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Learning Torah is permitted (when there is a smell), but not to say Shema.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even learning Torah is permitted only when it was someone else who passed wind, but one may not learn in the presence of an odor that he emitted.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SAYING SHEMA NEAR EXCREMENT OR URINE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(Since these are bad smells that have a source (she'Yesh Lahem Ikar), when Shema is forbidden, Divrei Torah are also forbidden.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> One may say Shema at the time that excrement passes by;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One may not say Shema then.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Abaye, for himself (and question against Rava) - Mishnah):</span> If a Metzora stands (is stationary) under a tree and a Tahor person passes (below the tree), the latter becomes Tamei;</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>(Just like Tum'ah in motion is not Metamei, excrement in motion does not forbid saying Shema!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Tum'as Tzara'as depends on being fixed in place -- "Badad Yeshev mi'Chutz la'Machaneh Moshavo";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah requires "v'Hayah Machanecha Kodesh" for saying Shema -- this does not apply when excrement passes through.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> A pig's snout is like passing excrement.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious (there is always excrement on it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Papa forbids even if the pig just left the river.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> If there is a Safek that excrement is present, it is forbidden to say Shema; if there is a Safek that urine is present, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Yehudah):</span> If there is a Safek that excrement is in the house, it is permitted (for excrement is not normally found there); if there is a Safek that excrement is in the wasteheap, it is forbidden (to say Shema near there);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Safek about urine is permitted even in a wasteheap.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>He holds like Rav Hamnuna and R. Yonasan:</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (R. Yonasan):</span> It says, "v'Yad Tiheyeh Lecha mi'Chutz la'Machaneh v'Yatzasa Shamah Chutz" (you must leave the inhabited area in order to relieve yourself, you need not cover it); it also says, "v'Yased Tiheyeh Lecha... v'Chisisa Es Tze'asecha" (you must cover it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> One must cover excrement, one need not cover urine.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This teaches that the Torah forbids saying Shema near urine only while it is falling; once it reaches the ground, it is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim forbid after it is on the ground; they decreed only about definite urine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How long [after urine reached the ground] is it forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel, Rabah bar bar Chanah, and Ula):</span> It is forbidden as long as it can wet what touches it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Geniva citing Rav):</span> It is forbidden as long as the ground looks different on account of the urine.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Why do you rely on that teaching, and not on the following?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna citing Rav):</span> Even if excrement is as hard as earthenware, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is excrement considered to be as hard as earthenware?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> This is when it does not crumble when thrown.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> This is when it does not crumble when rolled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> R. Yehudah mi'Difti once asked Ravina to check if excrement had formed a crust.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the conclusion?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ameimar forbid excrement that is like earthenware, Mar Zutra permitted it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah is, excrement like earthenware is forbidden, urine is forbidden as long as it can wet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Urine is forbidden as long as it can wet; if it was absorbed or dried, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The case of absorbed urine is like dried excrement, there is no trace of it; but if there is a trace of it, it is forbidden, even though it cannot wet.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It also says that urine is forbidden as long as it can wet -- we should infer, if [it cannot wet, but just] there is a trace of it, it is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The inferences contradict each other, we cannot determine from the Beraisa which is correct.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about this:</p>
