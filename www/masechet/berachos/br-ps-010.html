<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> This is difficult for you [Tzedukim], for you do not expound Semuchim (the reason why Parshiyos are adjacent to each other) -- we expound Semuchim, it is not difficult;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Semuchim la'Ad l'Olam Asuyim b'Emes v'Yashar" teaches that we should expound Semuchim.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> Hash-m's ways are unlike the ways of people -- a person draws a form on the wall, he cannot put in it Ru'ach (breath, or the ability to speak), Neshamah, or innards;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m draws a form (fetus) within a form (mother), and puts all of these in it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is as Chanah said -- we read "Ein Tzur k'Elokeinu" as if it said "Ein Tzayar k'Elokeinu" (no one can make forms like Hash-m).</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like Hash-m fills the world, the Neshamah fills the body;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like Hash-m sees and is not seen, also the Neshamah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Just like Hash-m sustains the whole world, the Neshamah sustains the body;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Just like Hash-m is Tahor, also the Neshamah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Just like Hash-m dwells in a hidden place, also the Neshamah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Thus, the Neshamah, which has these five attributes, should praise Hash-m, who has them!</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They disapproved of three:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He dammed the waters of Gichon (to impede Sancheriv's impending attack against Yerushalayim; Hash-m had promised to save Yerushalayim, he should have relied on this);</p>
