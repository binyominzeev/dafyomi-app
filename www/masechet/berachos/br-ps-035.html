<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE BLESSINGS SAID FOR FOOD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> Which blessing do we say for produce?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The blessing for fruits of a tree is Borei Pri ha'Etz, except for wine;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On wine we say Borei Pri ha'Gafen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>On things that grow from the ground we say Borei Pri ha'Adamah, except for bread;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On bread we say ha'Motzi Lechem Min ha'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>On Yerek (vegetables other than legumes) we say Borei Pri ha'Adamah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yehudah says, we say Borei Minei Desha'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> "Kodesh Hilulim la'Shem" -- this teaches that one must bless before and after eating [Revai, fourth-year produce];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is the source that it is forbidden to taste any food before blessing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> [Even though "Hilulim" (plural) connotes two praises,] we need this to teach two other laws!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One must redeem ("Chilul" is like "Hilul," "Hei" and "Ches" are interchangeable) Revai before eating it [outside Yerushalayim];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Redemption is needed only for what is used for Hilul (Shirah), i.e. wine:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> Shirah is said only over wine -- "va'Tomer Lahem ha'Gefen... Tiroshi ha'Mesame'ach Elokim va'Anashim."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We know that wine gladdens man -- how does it gladden Hash-m?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shirah [of the Leviyim gladdens Hash-m, it] is said only over wine (Nesachim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>(Tana'im argue whether or not the law of Revai applies to fruit of all trees, or only to grapes; there is an argument about the text of anonymous Mishnayos, whether it says Neta Revai (like the first opinion) or Kerem Revai (like the latter opinion).)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>This is not difficult for the first opinion -- he holds that all fruits must be redeemed, he does not expound (2) above, so one "Hilul" teaches that one must bless before eating;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>But according to the second opinion (Kerem Revai), how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya or R. Shimon b'Rebbi):</span> The text of the Mishnayos says Kerem Revai.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(The other of R. Chiya and R. Shimon b'Rebbi):</span> The text says Neta Revai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Partial answer:</span> If he learns the following Gezeirah Shavah, we can answer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> It says regarding Revai, "l'Hosif Lachem Tevu'aso," like it says regarding Kil'ei ha'Kerem, "u'Sevu'as ha'Karem" -- just like the latter refers [only] to produce of a vineyard, also Revai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Gezeirah Shavah teaches that only grapes must be redeemed, he need not expound (2) above, so one "Hilul" teaches that one must bless before eating;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>But if he does not learn the Gezeirah Shavah, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Even if he learns the Gezeirah Shavah, one "Hilul" should teach only about a Berachah Acharonah (after eating, like Birkas ha'Mazon) -- what is the source for a Berachah Rishonah (before eating)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to Question #2):</span> We learn from a Kal va'Chomer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one must bless when he is satiated, all the more so he must bless when he is hungry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about blessing for grapes -- what is the source to bless for other food?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from grapes -- just like people benefit from grapes and must bless for them, also for all food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from grapes, from which Olelos (deficient clusters) must be left for the poor, to other foods to which Olelos do not apply!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [Bread made from] Kamah [grain] show that this is not the determining factor -- one must bless after it, even though Olelos do not apply to it! (We know that one must bless for bread, for it says, "Tochal Bah Lechem... v'Achalta vSavata u'Verachta." Whenever we say "grain," this refers to wheat and barley (which are explicitly listed among the seven species) and their three subspecies, spelt, oats, and rye.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from Kamah, from which Chalah must be taken, to other foods to which Chalah does not apply!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Grapes show that this is not the determining factor;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Each has its own stringency; their Tzad ha'Shaveh (common side) is that people benefit from them and must bless for them, the same applies to all food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from grapes and Kamah, for both of these are brought on the Mizbe'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We can learn olives, for also [oil of] olives is brought on the Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even without this, we should say that one must bless for olives, for they are also called "Kerem" -- "... v'Ad Kerem Zayis."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> They are called "Kerem Zayis," they are not called [plain] Kerem.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Question (s) remains (we still lack a complete answer to Question (f)).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BENEFIT WITHOUT BLESSING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (f)):</span> Rather, we learn from the seven species of Eretz Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>(We are thinking that one must bless mid'Oraisa for the seven species, for it says, "Eretz Chitah u'Se'orah... v'Achalta vSavata u'Verachta.")</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like people benefit from them and must bless for them, also for all food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> We cannot learn from the seven species, for Bikurim are brought from them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> We could learn only a Berachah Acharonah from them, not a Berachah Rishonah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to Objection #2):</span> We learn from a Kal va'Chomer -- if one must bless when he is satiated, all the more so when he is hungry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (to Answer 1:g):</span> Above we said that the opinion that one who maintains "Neta Revai" can learn from "Kodesh Hilulim" -- but we can learn only fruits (to which Revai applies)! What is the source for other things, such as meat, eggs and fish?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question (1:f)):</span> Rather, reasoning dictates that it is forbidden to benefit from this world without blessing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It is forbidden to benefit from this world without blessing -- doing so is like transgressing Me'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one did so, what should he do to rectify it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He should go to a Chacham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What will a Chacham do for him, he already transgressed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> One should go to a Chacham from the beginning to learn the laws of Berachos, so he will not transgress Me'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One who benefits from this world without blessing is like one who benefits from Hekdesh -- "la'Shem ha'Aretz u'Melo'ah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (R. Levi):</span> It says "la'Shem ha'Aretz u'Melo'ah," and it says "ha'Shamayim Shamayim la'Shem veha'Aretz Nasan li'Venei Adam"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Before one blesses, everything belongs to Hash-m; after one blesses, it is considered his.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">35b----------------------------------------35b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina bar Papa):</span> If one benefits from this world without blessing, it is as if he steals from Hash-m (Rashba - denies His Hashgachah) and Keneses Yisrael -- "Gozel Aviv v'Imo... Chaver Hu l'Ish Mashchis";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Aviv" refers to Hash-m, "Imo" refers to Keneses Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does "Chaver Hu l'Ish Mashchis" mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina bar Papa):</span> He is a peer of Yarov'om ben Nevat, who was Hishchis (corrupted the ways of) Yisrael to Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (R. Chanina bar Papa):</span> It says, "v'Lakachti <i>Degani</i> b'Ito," and it says "v'Asafta <i>Deganecha</i>"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When Yisrael do Hash-m's will, it is considered their grain; when they do not, it is considered His.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael) Question:</span> What do we learn from "v'Asafta Deganecha"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer - Suggestion:</span> It says, "Lo Yamush Sefer ha'Torah ha'Zeh mi'Picha" -- perhaps this is literally true (one may never cease learning)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Asafta Deganecha" -- one should engage in earning a livelihood.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Shimon):</span> Can it really be that a man will engage in all agricultural labors -- plowing, sowing, reaping, threshing and winnowing, each in its time? When will he have time for Torah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, when Yisrael do Hash-m's will, others will do these for them -- "v'Amdu Zarim v'Ra'u Tzonchem...";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>When Yisrael do not do Hash-m's will (Tosfos - so totally), they must work themselves -- "v'Asafta Deganecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Furthermore, they will have to do others' work -- "va'Avadta Es Oyvecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Many Talmidim followed R. Yishmael and succeeded; many tried to follow R. Shimon and did not succeed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span><span class="cl">Rava (to Rabanan):</span> Please do not come in front of me [to learn] in Nisan and Tishrei (when you should be harvesting or pressing grapes and olives), in order that you will not lack food for the whole year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(v)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Later (current) generations are unlike previous generations!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Previous generations made their Torah Keva (primary) and their work Arai (secondary), they succeeded in both of them; later generations made their Torah Arai and their work Keva, and succeeded in neither.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also -- the early generations would bring their produce into the house through the gate, in order to obligate themselves to tithe it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Later generations bring their produce through the roof or yard in order to exempt it from tithes.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> Produce need be tithed only when it sees (is brought in through) the entrance of the house -- "Bi'arti ha'Kodesh Min ha'Bayis."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even entering the yard obligates one to tithe it -- "v'Achlu vi'She'arecha v'Save'u."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE BLESSING FOR WINE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [The Berachah for fruits...] except for wine...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is wine different from other fruits?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Because it improved (wine is better than grapes), its Berachah changes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Olive oil is better than olives, yet its Berachah does not change!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Berachah for olive oil is Borei Pri ha'Etz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is because there is no alternative Berachah suitable!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We cannot say Borei Pri ha'Zayis -- the fruit itself is called Zayis!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We could say Borei Pri Etz Zayis!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar Zutra):</span> Wine gets a special Berachah because it nourishes, oil does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Oil does nourish!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who vows not to eat "Mazon" (that which nourishes) may eat water and salt.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Everything other than water and salt is called "Mazon"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refutes Rav and Shmuel, who say that we bless Borei Minei Mezonos only for [foods from] the five species of grain;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Huna):</span> No, the Mishnah refers to one who said "Kol ha'Zan (anything that nourishes) is forbidden to me."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> This shows that oil nourishes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Wine sustains (this is a higher level of nourishment).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Wine does not sustain!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava used to drink wine every Erev Pesach to arouse his appetite, in order to eat much Matzah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Much wine arouses appetite, a small amount of wine sustains.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Wine does not sustain at all, only bread -- "v'Yayin Yesamach Levav Enosh... v'Lechem Levav Enosh Yis'ad"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, wine sustains and gladdens, bread only sustains.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should say Birkas ha'Mazon after wine!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not, for it is abnormal to base a meal on wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> If one bases a meal on wine, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If Eliyahu will tell us that wine can be the basis of a meal, he will say Birkas ha'Mazon -- until then, we are not concerned for his opinion, the Halachah is based on normal people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Berachah for olive oil is Borei Pri ha'Etz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one drinks it, he would not bless, for it is harmful!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Zar (non-Kohen) who drinks Terumah oil pays principal but not Chomesh (a fifth); a Zar who anoints with Terumah oil pays principal and Chomesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, he ingests the oil with bread.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the bread is primary and the oil is secondary;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The general rule is, if one eats a primary and a secondary food together, he blesses only on the primary, this exempts the secondary.</p>
