<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE GREATNESS OF <i>TEFILAH B'TZIBUR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">R. Yitzchak (to Rav Nachman):</span> Why didn't you pray in the synagogue?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> I was too weak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Yitzchak:</span> You should have gathered ten men to pray with you!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> That is an exertion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Yitzchak:</span> You should have asked a messenger to tell you when the congregation prays, so that you could pray at the same time!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Why is this important?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak citing R. Yochanan):</span> "Va'Ani Sefilasi Lecha Hash-m Es Ratzon" -- the time when Hash-m desires prayer is when the congregation prays.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> We learn from "b'Es Ratzon Anisicha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Acha b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> We learn from "Hen Kel Kabir Lo Yim'as" (Hash-m does not despise the prayer of a multitude) and "Podah v'Shalom Nafshi mi'Krav Li Ki v'Rabim Hayu Imadi."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Nasan):</span> Hash-m does not despise the prayer of a multitude -- "Hen Kel Kabir...";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It also says, "Podah v'Shalom Nafshi..." -- Hash-m says, if one engages in Torah and Chesed and prays with the congregation, I consider it as if he redeemed Me and My children from the nations.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Anyone who has a synagogue in his city and does not pray there is called a bad neighbor -- "Kol Shochnei ha'Ra'im...";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, he causes himself and his children to be exiled -- "Hineni Nosesham me'Al Admasam."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>When R. Yochanan heard that there are old people in Bavel, he was amazed, for it says, "Lema'an Yirbu Yemeichem vi'Yemei Veneichem Al ha'Adamah..." -- long life is only in Eretz Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When he heard that they come early to synagogue and stay late, he understood that this is their merit for long life.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Levi (to his children):</span> Come early to synagogue and stay late, in order that you will live a long life.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> He learns from "Ashrei Adam Shome'a Li Lishkod Al Dalsosai... Ki Motz'i Matza Chayim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> A person should enter the synagogue [through] two doors.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is unreasonable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, one should (Rashba - pause the time to) enter two doorway widths (eight Tefachim; some say eight Amos) into the synagogue before praying (Rashi - so it will not look like he is eager to leave).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE THINGS FOR WHICH ONE MUST PRAY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> "Al Zos Yispalel... <i>l'Es Metzo</i>" -- one should pray for a proper wife, "Matza Ishah Matza Tov";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In Eretz Yisrael, when someone gets married, they say to him, "[Is she] Matza or Motzei";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the Kalah is proper, then "Matza Ishah Matza Tov"; if not, "Motzei Ani Mar mi'Maves Es ha'Ishah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Nasan):</span> "L'Es Metzo" refers to Torah -- "Ki Motz'i Matza Chayim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It refers to an easy death -- "La'Maves Totza'os."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support: (Beraisa):</span> There are 903 kinds of death -- this is the Gematri'a of "Totza'os";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The worst is Askara (the throat constricts), the best is Neshikah (through the "kiss" of Hash-m);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Neshamah leaving the body through Askara is like pulling out thorns stuck in wool, it tears the wool;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Some say, it is like pulling a rope through a hole that is no bigger.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Neshikah is like pulling a hair out of milk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "L'Es Metzo" refers to burial.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> He learns from "ha'Semechim Elei Gil Yasisu Ki Yimtze'u Kaver."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Shila):</span> This is like people say, a person should pray for Hash-m's mercy until the last shovel of dirt is put on him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> "L'Es Metzo" refers to having a bathroom nearby.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> This is the best explanation [for the thing for which one must pray].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda):</span> What do we learn from "Ohev Hash-m Sha'arei Tziyon mi'Kol Mishkenos Yakov"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m loves places where learning leads to definitive Halachah, more than all the synagogues and Batei Medrash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Ami):</span> After the Churban (when the Great Sanhedrin is not in its place), these places of Halachah are the only places dear to Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> At first, I used to learn in my house and pray in synagogue; after I heard R. Chiya's teaching, I pray only where I learn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Even though there were 13 synagogues in Tzipori. R. Ami and R. Asi would pray only where they learned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Ami):</span> One who benefits from his own exertion is better than one who fears Hash-m:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding the latter it says, "Ashrei Ish Yarei Es Hash-m"; regarding the former it says "Yegi'a Kapecha Ki Sochal Ashrecha v'Tov Lach" -- you will be happy in this world <i>and</i> it will be good for you in the World to Come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Ami):</span> One should always live near his Rebbi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shlomo did not marry the daughter of Pharaoh (which caused him to decline terribly) as long as Shim'i ben Gera (his Rebbi) was alive.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One should not live near his Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he accepts his Rebbi's rebuke, it is better to live near him; if not, it is better not to (lest he will be considered to sin b'Mezid, intentionally, after receiving rebuke.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LISTENTING TO <i>KERI'AS HA'TORAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna bar Yehudah):</span> "V'Ozvei Hash-m Yichlu" -- this is one who leaves synagogue during the reading of the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Avahu would leave after one person finished, before the next began to read.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> May one leave in between verses?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>This question is unsettled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rav Sheshes would turn away and recite his learning -- "They are learning theirs, I am learning mine!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>(Tosfos - one may not do so out loud, for this would make it hard for others to hear. Rif - this is permitted only if ten others are listening to the reading; moreover, perhaps it is permitted only for one who is not involved with anything other than Torah. Some permit this only for a blind person, who is exempt from learning the written Torah - Tosfos Sotah 39a.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna bar Yehudah):</span> One should finish reading the weekly Torah portion, twice in Lashon ha'Kodesh and once in the Targum (Aramaic translation of Onkelus), with the congregation (before it is read on Shabbos);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>(Rosh - a commentary that explains every word is acceptable in place of Targum.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This applies even to a verse such as "Ataros v'Divon" (which has no Targum Onkelus. Rashi - such a verse should be read three times; Tosfos - he should read its Yerushalmi Targum).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who finishes the Parshiyos with the congregation is rewarded with lengthened days (some explain - filled with goodness) and years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav Bivi bar Abaye planned to finish the Parshiyos of the entire year on Erev Yom Kipur. (Aruch's text - the Parshiyos read during the Kalah (in the months of Adar and Elul, when he was occupied with the learning of the Kalah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Chiya bar Rav mi'Difti - Beraisa) Question:</span> "V'Inisem Es Nafshoseichem b'Sish'ah la'Chodesh ba'Erev" -- the fast of Yom Kipur is on the tenth, not on the ninth!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that anyone who eats on the ninth (Rashi - to prepare for the fast; R. Yonah - to show his joy that the time for pardon of sins is coming) is considered as if he fasted on the ninth and tenth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(Therefore, do not plan to spend the entire day finishing the Parshiyos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Rav Bivi accepted this; he planned to finish all the Parshiyos at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(An elder - Beraisa):</span> One may not read them before or after (the Tzibur, which starts reading a Parshah at Minchah of the previous Shabbos - Tosfos).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ADVICE OF TANA'IM TO THEIR CHILDREN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Levi (to his sons):</span> Finish the Parshiyos, twice in Lashon ha'Kodesh and once in Targum, with the congregation; be careful about veins, like R. Yehudah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> One who slaughters must also cut the veins (of a bird, which is often roasted whole, for otherwise the blood will not exude).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Also, be careful about [honoring] a Chacham who, against his will, forgot his learning;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Luchos and the broken Luchos were both in the Aron.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rava (to his sons):</span> When you cut meat, do not cut it over your hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> This is lest he will cut his hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> This is lest he will make a minor cut in his hand, and the blood will come on the meat, and no one will want to eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Also, do not sit on the bed of a Nochris:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> This means, do not go to sleep without saying Keri'as Shema;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> It means, do not marry a convert.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #3:</span> It literally means, do not sit on the bed of a Nochris, because of an incident with Rav Papa.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A Nochris asked Rav Papa to sit on a bed -- he inspected it, and found a dead baby underneath (she wanted to blame him for killing it);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim forbade to sit on a Nochris' bed on account of this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Also, one must not pass in back of a synagogue when the congregation is praying (for it looks like he does not want to pray with them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> It is forbidden only if the following conditions are met:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There is no other entrance, and there is no other synagogue in the city, he is not carrying a load, running, or wearing Tefilin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If even one of these is not met, it is permitted (people will assume that he already prayed, or will pray with a Tzibur, or will understand why he cannot, or will see that the fear of Heaven is upon him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> I admire the Persians for three things:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They cut meat only over a table (not over their hands);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They kiss only on the back of the hand (a kiss leaves saliva, this is improper on the other's face);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>They take counsel only in the field (lest others will hear);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> We learn [that it is proper to do] this from "va'Yishlach Yakov l'Rachel ul'Leah ha'Sadeh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Gamliel):</span> I admire the Persians for three things -- their modesty in eating, the bathroom (they had latrines in which the excrement falls along an incline, away from the person), and in relations.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> Nevertheless, "Ani Tziveisi l'Mekudashai" -- this refers to the Persians, they are Mekudash (designated) for Gehinom.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE LATEST TIME FOR THE EVENING SHEMA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Gamliel):</span> The evening Shema may be said until dawn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> A person can read Shema twice during the night, once before dawn and once after dawn, and fulfill his obligation for the night and morning Shema.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> He contradicts himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He says "twice during the night" -- this implies that after dawn (but before sunrise) is night;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He says that he fulfills his obligation for the morning Shema -- this implies that it is day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, it is night; since some people rise then, it is time for morning Shema.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Chinena citing R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Beraisa - R. Shimon citing R. Akiva):</span> A person can read Shema twice during the day, once before sunrise and once after sunrise, and fulfill his obligation for the night and morning Shema.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He says "twice during the day" -- this implies that before sunrise (but after dawn) is day;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He says that he fulfills his obligation for the evening Shema -- this implies that it is night!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, it is day; since some people are sleeping then, it is still time for the evening Shema.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Chinena citing R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon citing R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> This is the Halachah, but one may not say "Hashkivenu" (for people do not <i>go</i> to sleep then).</p>
