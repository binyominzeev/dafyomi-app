<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Mar brei d'Ravina saw that the Rabanan were overly jovial at the wedding of his son; he brought a precious crystal worth 400 Zuz and broke it to suppress their gaiety. Rav Ashi did similarly at the wedding of his son.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>At the wedding of Mar brei d'Ravina, the Rabanan asked Rav Hamnuna Zuti to sing for them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rav Hamnuna:</span> Woe to us that we will die, woe to us that we will die!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> What should we respond?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Hamnuna:</span> You should say, "Where are our Torah and Mitzvos to protect us (from Gehinom)?"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It is forbidden to fill one's mouth with laughter in this world -- "<i>Az</i> Yemalei Sechok Pinu u'Leshonenu Rinah," only <i>then</i> will laughter fill our mouths;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The verse permits it only when the nations will say (in the times of Mashi'ach), "Higdil Hash-m La'asos Im Eleh."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reish Lakish never filled his mouth with laughter after he heard this from R. Yochanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not start to pray amidst judging or [determining] Halachah (lest he be distracted during prayer), one should pray amidst learning a Halachah Pesukah (a clear, previously-determined Halachah that does not require deep thought).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered a Halachah Pesukah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> R. Zeira's law is an example.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> [Even though a woman cannot become a Zavah unless she sees blood on three consecutive days,] the daughters of Yisrael are stringent to [consider themselves Zavos and] observe seven clean days (before immersing to become Tehoros) after seeing even a tiny drop of blood the size of a mustard seed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The laws of R. Hoshaya and Rav Huna are examples.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Hoshaya):</span> A person may scheme, and bring produce into his house with the chaff, and his animal (or a person, if he eats casually) may eat without tithing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If one lets blood from a Korban, the blood is Asur b'Hana'ah, Me'ilah applies to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Rabanan followed our Mishnah (it suffices to be serious before praying), Rav Ashi followed the Beraisa (he would begin amidst Halachah Pesukah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not start to pray amidst sadness, laziness, laughter, mockery, lightheadedness or idle talk, rather, amidst the Simchah of a Mitzvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Likewise, one should not take leave of his friend amidst mockery, laughter, lightheadedness, or idle talk, rather, amidst a [teaching of[ Halachah (Gra - Simchah of a Mitzvah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We find that the Nevi'im ended their words with praise and supplication.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mari brei d'Rav Huna - Beraisa):</span> One should leave his friend amidst a [teaching of] Halachah, for through it, he will remember him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Kahana accompanied Rav Simi bar Ashi from Pum Nahara until Bei Tzenisa (a grove of date trees); when he arrived, he said, "People say that these date trees are from Adam ha'Rishon."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Simi bar Ashi:</span> That reminds me of R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina's teaching!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina) Question:</span> "Ba'Aretz Lo Avar Bah Ish v'Lo Yashav Adam Sham" -- since no one passed through, obviously no one settled there!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that Adam ha'Rishon decreed which places would be settled and which would not, and it was fulfilled.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>VERSES THAT TEACH ABOUT PRAYER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who prays must direct his heart towards Heaven;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> When R. Akiva would pray with the Tzibur he would pray quickly, not to burden them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When he would pray alone, one would leave him in one corner and find him later in another corner.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did he move? (One must stand still during prayer!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He moved through many bowings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> One should always pray in a house with windows -- "v'Chavin Pesichan Lei..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one may pray all day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Zimnin Telasa..." (Daniel prayed only three times a day.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he started to pray three times a day only after he was exiled!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Di Hava Aved Min Kadmas Denah" (he was accustomed to doing so).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (He prayed) "Neged Yerushelem."</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Chanah prayed "v'Kolah Lo Yishame'a."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one may request his needs and then pray [the first three blessings of praise]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Lishmo'a El ha'Rinah v'El ha'Tefilah" -- Rinah refers to praise, it is before Tefilah (request).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>One may not say anything between [the end of] Emes v'Yatziv and Shemoneh Esreh, but one may add [prayers] after Shemoneh Esreh, even as lengthy as the confession of Yom Kipur!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Ashi):</span> Even though one may request [anything] in Shome'a Tefilah, one may add [prayers] after Shemoneh Esreh, even like the confession of Yom Kipur!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CHANAH'S PRAYER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> We learn so many important laws from Chanah's Tefilah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Chanah Hi Medaberes Al Libah" -- this teaches that one who prays must have intent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Rak Sefaseha Na'os" -- this teaches that one must articulate the words with his lips;</p>

<p class="bas bbbline">31b----------------------------------------31b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Ula or R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> "Va'Ta'an Chanah va'Tomer Lo Adoni" -- you (Eli) are not a master in this matter (of my prayer), nor is Ru'ach ha'Kodesh upon you;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You suspect [that I am drunk, but you are wrong).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> She told him, "Aren't you a master? Don't you have Ru'ach ha'Kodesh?!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why did you judge me unfavorably? Don't you know that I am anguished; I have not consumed wine or strong drink!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "V'Yayin v'Shechar Lo Shasisi" -- this teaches that if one is wrongly suspected, he must inform the one who suspects him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Al Titen Es Amascha Lifnei Vas Beliya'al" -- this teaches that praying while drunk is like serving idols;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "Beliya'al," like it says about enticers (of a city) to serve idolatry -- "Yatz'u Anashim Benei Veliya'al mi'Kirbecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>"Va'Ya'an Eli va'Yomer Lechi l'Shalom" -- this shows that one who incorrectly suspected someone must appease him;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Va'Tidor Neder va'Tomer Hash-m <i>Tzevakos</i>" -- Chanah was the first person to call Hash-m by this name;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She said, "You created so many legions -- is it difficult for You to give me one son?!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">This is a parable:</span> a mortal king made a meal for his servants. A poor person came to the door and asked for a piece of bread; no one paid attention to him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He forced his way in to see the king, and said, "From this great meal that you made, is it difficult for you to give to me a piece of bread?!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R.

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You will not falsify Your Torah, which says, "v'Niksah v'Nizre'ah Zara" (if she is innocent, she will conceive)! (Penei Yehoshua - surely, she did not really threaten to do so; a married woman may not be in seclusion with another man! Rather, she argued that it is not proper that she should not get what a less scrupulous woman could "force" Hash-m to give her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that if she (an innocent woman who drinks Mei Sotah) was barren, she will conceive;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But according to the opposing opinion, which says that "v'Nizre'ah Zara" applies only to women who already had children, why did she say "Im <i>Ra'oh Sir'eh</i>"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> "V'Niksah v'Nizre'ah Zara" -- if she was barren, she will conceive;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> That is unreasonable -- if so, barren women will seclude themselves with other men, and (since they are innocent) they will conceive! (Alternatively: and should a Tzadekes who refuses to do so lose out?!)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, if she used to give birth in pain (or to female, short, dark or single births), she will gave birth easily (or to male, tall, white babies, or twins).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is the way people speak; the Torah also speaks like this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Why did she call herself, "Your slave" three times -- "ba'Oni Amasecha," "v'Lo Sishkach Es Amasecha," "v'Nasata la'Amascha"?</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Eli had told them to get a Kohen to slaughter; this caused a delay, and Shmuel told them that a Zar may slaughter [Kodshim] (therefore, they brought him to Eli).</p>
