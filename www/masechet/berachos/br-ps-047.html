<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHOM DO WE HONOR AND/OR WAIT FOR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not honor (let important people go first) on the road, on bridges, or regarding filthy hands (Mayim Acharonim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Ravin and Abaye were traveling; Ravin's donkey went ahead of Abaye's, yet he did not tell Abaye to go first (even though Abaye was greater). Abaye was thinking, because Ravin comes from Eretz Yisrael he feels intimate with the Chachamim (and does not need to honor them). When they came to the entrance to the synagogue, Ravin asked Abaye to enter first.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Until now, you did not consider me to be above you!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Ravin:</span> R. Yochanan taught, we honor only at an opening with a Mezuzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do we not honor at an opening without a Mezuzah?! If so, we do not honor at the entrance to a synagogue or study hall!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, we honor only at an opening fit to have a Mezuzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Rav):</span> Those seated may not eat at all until the Botze'a tastes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Safra:</span> Rav said, they may not <i>taste</i> until the Botze'a tastes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Rav Safra need to say this, it means the same!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One must repeat teachings in the exact way that he heard them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If two people eat together from a serving bowl, each must stop eating when the other stops (e.g. to drink); three people need not wait for each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The Botze'a is the first to take; he may honor his Rebbi or someone greater than himself (by giving this right to them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rabah bar bar Chanah (to his son):</span> The Botze'a may not cut the bread until the people (who will be Yotzei with his Berachah) finish answering "Amen."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> He must wait for most of the people to answer "Amen."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> Presumably, he must wait for most of the people because "Amen" is considered part of the Berachah, it is not finished yet;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The same applies to the minority, he should also wait for them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> One who delays answering "Amen" errs (therefore, the Botze'a need not wait for him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not answer "Amen" that is Chatufah (the "Alef" is punctuated with a Chataf (what we call Shva), in place of a Kamatz), truncated (the "Nun" is not articulated well) or orphaned (he does not know what Berachah was said, he just heard others answering);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may not hurriedly say a Berachah (like a burden he wants to be exempt from).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Ben Azai says, if one says an orphaned Amen, his children will be orphaned; if he says a Chatufah or truncated Amen, his life will be Chatufah (grabbed) or truncated, i.e. he will die prematurely;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If one prolongs saying Amen, his life will be lengthened.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Rav and Shmuel were eating; Rav Simi bar Chiya came, and ate quickly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> Do you want to join for a Zimun? We already finished!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> If they would bring (for dessert) mushrooms for me or young fowl for you, wouldn't we eat?! (Therefore, it is as if we are still eating, and Rav Simi may join for the Zimun.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Rav's Talmidim were eating; Rav Acha came. They said, a great man came, he will make a Zimun.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rav Acha:</span> The Gadol at the meal does not lead the Zimun (if he came later), rather, one of the people who was there from the beginning is Mezamen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>The Halachah is, the Gadol is Mezamen, even if he came at the end.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHO JOINS FOR A <i>ZIMUN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [The following count towards the three for a Zimun...] one who ate Demai (doubtfully tithed produce)...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is forbidden to eat Demai!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since if he would make all his possessions Hefker (and thereby become poor), it would be permitted to him, he joins for a Zimun.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>(Since there is a permitted way to eat Demai, this shows that it is a light Isur, therefore one who ate it joins for a Zimun.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may feed Demai to a poor person or to soldiers (whom the city must feed).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna - Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> We may not feed Demai to poor person or to soldiers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Ma'aser Rishon from which Terumah was taken...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, a Levi received Ma'aser Rishon from sheaves and separated Terumas Ma'aser from it, but Terumah Gedolah was not taken.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> If a Levi received Ma'aser Rishon from sheaves, it is exempt from Terumah Gedolah -- "va'Haremosem Mimenu Terumas Hash-m Ma'aser Min ha'Ma'aser" -- a Levi must take [only] Ma'aser Min ha'Ma'aser (Terumas Ma'aser), not Terumah Gedolah and Terumas Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If so, the verse should exempt even if he received Ma'aser Rishon from a Kri (pile of grain)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> In this case we apply the verse, "mi'Kol Matnoseichem Tarimu."</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">47b----------------------------------------47b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not exempt Ma'aser from a Kri and obligate Ma'aser from sheaves?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We obligate Ma'aser from a Kri because it is considered Dagan (grain, from which Terumah must be given), sheaves are not considered Dagan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Ma'aser Sheni or Hekdesh that was redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the principle was given, the added Chomesh (fifth) was not given;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah teaches that giving the extra Chomesh does not prevent the redemption from taking effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A waiter who ate a k'Zayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that a waiter is not established (his eating is always haphazard, and thus he does not join for a Zimun) -- the Mishnah teaches, this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Kusi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does a Kusi join for a Zimun? He should be no better than an Am ha'Aretz!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> An Am ha'Aretz does not join for a Zimun.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah discusses a Kusi Chaver (he observes Mitzvos properly).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> It discusses even a Kusi Am ha'Aretz -- the Mishnah refers to the Am ha'Aretz that R. Meir discusses, the Beraisa refers to the Am ha'Aretz of Chachamim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> An Am ha'Aretz is one who does not eat Chulin b'Taharah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, it is one who does not tithe properly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Kusim tithe properly -- we find that they keep Mitzvos explicit in the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon Ben Gamliel):</span> Every Mitzvah that the Kusim are Muchzakim in, they keep it much more meticulously than Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> [Chachamim often discussed an Am ha'Aretz:] who is considered an Am ha'Aretz?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Eliezer):</span> It is one who does not say Keri'as Shema every morning and evening.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehoshua):</span> It is one who does not put on Tefilin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ben Azai):</span> It is one who does not have Tzitzis on his garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Nasan):</span> It is one who does not have a Mezuzah on his door.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (R. Nasan bar Yosef):</span> It is one who has sons and does not teach them Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Answer #6 (Acherim):</span> Even one who learned Tanach and Mishnah, if he lacks Shimush Chachamim (to learn the reasons for the Mishnayos, what we call Gemara), he is an Am ha'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The Halachah follows Acherim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>Rami bar Chama would not include Rav Menasiyah bar Tachlifa in a Zimun, even though Rav Menasiyah had learned Sifra, Sifri and Halachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> This is the only reason why Rami bar Chama died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - Others):</span> Even one who learned Tanach and Mishnah, if he lacks Shimush Chachamim, he is an Am ha'Aretz. (Rami acted correctly!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer:</span> Rav Menasiyah had Shimush Chachamim; Rami had not investigated about him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer:</span> Rav Menasiyah heard and memorized teachings of Amora'im, he is considered a Chacham.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THOSE WHO DO NOT JOIN FOR A <i>ZIMUN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [The following do not join...] one who ate Tevel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches that even if the food is [exempt mid'Oraisa and] Tevel mid'Rabanan, he does not join.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is such a case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It grew in a flowerpot without a hole (it does not nurture from the ground).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He ate Ma'aser Rishon from which Terumah was not taken.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious (if Terumas Ma'aser was not taken, one who eats it is Chayav Misah bi'Yedei Shamayim, just like one who eats Tevel)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, a Levi received Ma'aser Rishon from a Kri (Terumas Ma'aser was taken but Terumah Gedolah was not taken);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought (that it is exempt from Terumah Gedolah) like Rav Papa's question -- the Mishnah teaches, this is not so, like Abaye's answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Ma'aser Sheni or Hekdesh that was not redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, they were redeemed, but improperly;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ma'aser Sheni was redeemed on an Asimon (a slug), the Torah requires "v'<i>Tzar</i>ta ha'Kesef b'Yadecha," a [minted] coin with a Tzurah (form).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Hekdesh was redeemed onto land, not money;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It says that one will give the money and then "v'Kam Lo" (then the Hekdesh will be redeemed, and hence his).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A waiter who ate less than a k'Zayis;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [This is taught for parallel structure;] the Reisha said that if he ate a k'Zayis he joins for a Zimun, so the Seifa discusses less than a k'Zayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Nochri does not join.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious (he has no Mitzvah to bless)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he was circumcised for the sake of converting but did not immerse;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> He is not a convert until he is circumcised and immerses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Before immersion, he is a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>INCLUDING CHILDREN OR SLAVES IN A <i>ZIMUN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not include women, slaves or children in a Zimun.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Asi):</span> We may include a baby in a crib for a Zimun.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> We do not include women, slaves or children in a Zimun.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Asi holds like R. Yehoshua ben Levi:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Even though we may not include a baby in a crib for a Zimun, he may be included for ten (to mention Hash-m's name in the Zimun).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Nine Jews and a [Kena'ani] slave join (to allow Devarim shebi'Kdushah, things which may be said only with ten men, to be recited).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A case occurred, R. Eliezer found only nine in the synagogue, so he freed his slave to be the tenth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He would not join if he was not freed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There were only eight Jews and two slaves -- he freed one slave, then the other joined for the Minyan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is forbidden to free a slave!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Anyone who frees a slave transgresses an Aseh -- "l'Olam Bahem Ta'avodu."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because it was for a Mitzvah, it was permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mitzvah came through a transgression, it is not considered a Mitzvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because it was for a Mitzvah d'Rabim (of many people), it was permitted. (Rosh - even though it is only mid'Rabanan, it overrides an Isur d'Oraisa of an individual.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> One should rise early to be one of the first ten in synagogue -- even if 100 come later, he gets the reward of all of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> He gets as much reward as all of them together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The Aron Kodesh joins with nine men.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> The Aron is not a person!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Huna):</span> Rather, if nine people look like ("Nir'eh") ten, they join:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> This means, if they are gathered together (one cannot tell that they are only nine).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> This means, if they are dispersed (they appear to be many).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> Two people and Shabbos join (for a Zimun).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Shabbos is not a person!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Correction (R. Ami):</span> Rather, two Chachamim that sharpen each other in Halachah (Tosfos ha'Rosh - during the meal) join (for a Zimun - the Halachah counts like a person).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Chisda pointed to himself and Rav Sheshes (to illustrate such people), Rav Sheshes did the same.</p>
