<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO SHOULD BLESS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Zeira fell sick; R. Avahu came to visit him, and accepted upon himself to make a feast for the Rabanan if R. Zeira will recover; he did. At the meal, R. Avahu asked R. Zeira to be Botze'a (bless ha'Motzi and cut the bread).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> R. Yochanan taught that the host is Botze'a!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Avahu was Botze'a; at the end of the meal, he asked R. Zeira to say Birkas ha'Mazon for everyone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> Rav Huna taught that the one who was Botze'a blesses Birkas ha'Mazon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom did R. Avahu hold?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He held like R. Yochanan:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The host is Botze'a, and the guest blesses Birkas ha'Mazon;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The host is Botze'a, for he will cut generous pieces for everyone; (Rashba - nevertheless, R. Avahu considered R. Zeira to be the host, for the meal was on account of him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The guest blesses Birkas ha'Mazon, in order to bless the host.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Berachah does the guest give to the host?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He says, "May it be Your will that the host not experience shame in this world nor in the World to Come."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rebbi used to add, "His possessions should prosper... there should never arise for him or us sinful thoughts."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BIRKAS HA'ZIMUN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How far does Birkas ha'Zimun extend? (Tosfos - when one ceases eating (alternatively, if he had left and returned) in order to listen to a Zimun, until when must he listen? Rashi - until where is an individual exempt?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> It is until "Nevarech."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> It is until (and including) Birkas ha'Zan (the first Berachah of Birkas ha'Mazon).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue like the following Tana'im:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) (Beraisa #1):</span> Birkas ha'Mazon is two or three Berachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> It is three or four Berachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We are thinking that all agree that ha'Tov veha'Metiv is mid'Rabanan (and is not counted).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Tana #1 holds that Birkas ha'Zimun is until [the end of] Birkas ha'Zan (it is said only in a Zimun; the other two Berachos of Birkas ha'Mazon, Birkas ha'Aretz and Boneh Yerushalayim are said with or without a Zimun);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Tana #2 holds that Birkas ha'Zimun is until Nevarech (it is considered its own Berachah; the three Berachos of Birkas ha'Mazon are said with or without a Zimun).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) (Beraisa #1):</span> Birkas ha'Mazon may be said by (i.e. divided among) up to three people. (Different people may say different blessings on behalf of everyone, but we may not split up one blessing.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> It may be said by up to four people.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>We are thinking that all agree that ha'Tov veha'Metiv is mid'Rabanan (and is not counted).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>Tana #1 [allows up to three people, because he] holds that Birkas ha'Zimun is until Birkas ha'Zan (the Mezamen must say all of it; two others may say Birkas ha'Aretz and Boneh Yerushalayim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>Tana #2 [allows up to four people, because he] holds that Birkas ha'Zimun is until Nevarech (the Mezamen need not say more than this, three others may say the three Berachos of Birkas ha'Mazon). (End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, each Amora explains that both Tana'im agree with him:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Nachman says that all agree that Birkas ha'Zimun is until Nevarech;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We understand Beraisa #2 (as explained above);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Beraisa #1 discusses [a shortened Birkas ha'Mazon for] workers;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A worker says Birkas ha'Zan, and combines Birkas ha'Aretz and Boneh Yerushalayim into one Berachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Rav Sheshes says that all agree that Birkas ha'Zimun is until Birkas ha'Zan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>We understand Beraisa #1 (as explained above);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Tana #2 holds that ha'Tov veha'Metiv is mid'Oraisa, therefore he counts one more Berachah (Tosfos - person).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Surely, ha'Tov veha'Metiv is mid'Rabanan, for workers omit it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Shmuel):</span> Surely, ha'Tov veha'Metiv is mid'Rabanan, for it begins with "Baruch" but doesn't end with "Baruch";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> All Berachos begin and end with "Baruch," except for Berachos [Rishonos] on food, on Mitzvos, and a Berachah that follows another Berachah, and the last Berachah of Keri'as Shema;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Some of these begin with "Baruch" but do not end with "Baruch" (e.g. for food), and some end with "Baruch" but do not begin with "Baruch" (such as a Berachah that follows another Berachah).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">46b----------------------------------------46b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Ha'Tov veha'Metiv begins with "Baruch" but does not end with "Baruch" -- this shows that it is independent (it was enacted later, it is only mid'Rabanan)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Surely, ha'Tov veha'Metiv is mid'Rabanan, for [some say that] it is omitted in a house of mourners!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> In a house of an Avel, we say ha'Tov veha'Metiv (as the fourth Berachah of Birkas ha'Mazon);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, we say, "Dayan ha'Emes."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the first Tana say that we say ha'Tov veha'Metiv but not Dayan ha'Emes?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he means we even say ha'Tov veha'Metiv.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Mar Zutra visited Rav Ashi; a relative of Rav Ashi died. Mar Zutra said, "ha'Tov veha'Metiv Kel Emes Dayan Emes..." (acknowledging the truth of His judgment, and praying that He should fix all breaches in Yisrael).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Question:</span> If Reuven stopped eating to listen to a Zimun, after he finishes eating from what point does he resume Birkas ha'Mazon?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Zevid):</span> He returns to the beginning (Birkas ha'Zan, because he was already obligated to bless with a Zimun).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabanan):</span> He returns to where he stopped [listening, and resumes Birkas ha'Mazon with Birkas ha'Aretz, like an individual who is exempt from Zimun].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Question:</span> [If Reuven had gone away and they called him to make a Zimun, later, when he says Birkas ha'Mazon], from what point does he continue Birkas ha'Mazon?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Zevid):</span> He returns to the beginning (i.e. Birkas ha'Zan).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabanan):</span> He returns to where he stopped (Birkas ha'Aretz; Tosfos - according to Rav Nachman, after Nevarech).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Version #3 (Tosfos) Question:</span> When the Mezamen says "Nevarech," and the others answer "Baruch she'Achalnu mi'Shelo," where does he resume?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Zevid):</span> He returns to the beginning (he says "Nevarech she'Achalnu mi'Shelo").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabanan):</span> He returns to where he stopped (he says "Baruch she'Achalnu mi'Shelo"). (End of Version #3)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>The Halachah is, he returns to where he stopped.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ETIQUETTE AT A MEAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Reish Galusa (to Rav Sheshes):</span> Even though you Rabanan are old, the Persians know more about etiquette at a meal than you!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When there are two couches (on which people recline while eating), first the Gadol (more important person) reclines, then the other reclines <i>above</i> him (his couch is next to the Gadol's head);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When there are three, first the Gadol reclines in the middle bed, then the second (next most important) above him, then the third below him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes:</span> This is not good -- if the Gadol wants to speak with the second, he must straighten up (for his head is turned away from the second)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Reish Galusa:</span> The Persians gesture (they do not need to speak).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes:</span> In which order do they wash before eating?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Reish Galusa:</span> The Gadol washes first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes:</span> Is it proper that he must wait until everyone else washes?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Reish Galusa:</span> He is served immediately, he need not wait.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes:</span> In which order do they wash after eating?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Reish Galusa:</span> The Katan washes first (then the next smallest, and so on; the Gadol washes last).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes:</span> Is it proper that the Gadol's hands remain dirty until everyone else washes?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Reish Galusa:</span> They leave the food in front of him, he may eat while others wash.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes - Beraisa):</span> When there are two couches, first the Gadol reclines, then the other below him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When there are three, first the Gadol reclines in the middle, then the second above him, then the third below him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>(Even though the Gadol will have to straighten up if he wants to speak with the second, this is better than disgracing the second (by putting him below and the Katan on top) or having the Gadol at the top (the middle is the most distinguished place).)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The Gadol washes first before eating (and he is served immediately);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Regarding washing after eating:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If there are at most five people, the Gadol washes first;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If there are more than five, the others wash first, until only five remain; then the Gadol washes (at which time the food is removed from before him).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>The one who washed fifth from the end (the Gadol, or one to whom he gave this honor) blesses on behalf of everyone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>This supports Rav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The first of the last five to wash is the Mezamen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Rav and R. Chiya were eating with Rebbi. Rebbi told Rav to wash his hands; Rav was nervous (he thought that he had done something wrong).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya (to Rav):</span> Rebbi is just telling you to prepare to be Mezamen.</p>
