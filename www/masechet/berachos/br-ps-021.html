<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE BLESSINGS FOR LEARNING TORAH AND FOR EATING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding Shemoneh Esreh, we are not concerned that he be engaged in the same matter as the Tzibur!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If, during Shemoneh Esreh, one remembers that he is a Ba'al Keri, he does not stop praying, rather, he says abridged blessings.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he not yet started, he should not start!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He must be engaged in Keri'as Shema with the Tzibur, for it contains accepting Ol Malchus Shamayim -- this does not apply to Shemoneh Esreh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Birkas ha'Mazon does not have acceptance of Ol Malchus Shamayim, yet our Mishnah says that a Ba'al Keri says it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He must engage in Keri'as Shema and Birkas ha'Mazon, for they are mid'Oraisa; Shemoneh Esreh is only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yehudah):</span> What is the source that mid'Oraisa one must bless after eating?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Achalta v'Savata u'Verachta."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that mid'Oraisa one must bless before learning Torah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ki Shem Hash-m Ekra Havu Godel l'Elokeinu."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> A Kal va'Chomer from Birkas ha'Mazon teaches that mid'Oraisa one must bless after learning Torah; a Kal va'Chomer from Birkas ha'Torah teaches that mid'Oraisa one must bless before eating!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah does not [explicitly] require blessing before eating, it requires blessing after eating; since it requires blessing before learning Torah, all the more so one must bless after learning Torah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Torah does not [explicitly] require blessing after learning Torah, it requires blessing before learning Torah; since it requires blessing after eating, all the more so one must bless before eating!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> We cannot learn [to bless for] Torah from eating, for eating is different, because one physically benefits from eating!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> We cannot learn [to bless for] eating from Torah, for Torah is different, because it gives one eternal life!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection #3 (Mishnah):</span> He blesses after eating, but not before eating (for the latter is only mid'Rabanan).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>R. Yochanan is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>REPEATING <i>TEFILOS</i> WHEN IN DOUBT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one is unsure whether or not he said Keri'as Shema, he need not say it out of doubt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one is unsure whether or not he said Emes v'Yatziv, he must say it. (Tosfos - perhaps he did not mention Yetzi'as Mitzrayim, i.e. he is also unsure whether or not he said [Parshas Tzitzis in] Keri'as Shema.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [He holds that] Keri'as Shema is mid'Rabanan, Emes v'Yatziv is mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> "Uv'Shachbecha uv'Kumecha" -- mid'Oraisa, one must say Keri'as Shema!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> That refers to learning Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> A Ba'al Keri thinks about the Berachos before Shema and after (i.e. Emes v'Yatziv), but does not say them; he blesses after eating, but only thinks about the Berachah before eating.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Emes v'Yatziv is mid'Oraisa, he should say it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> [If it is only mid'Rabanan,] why do we say it?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is not in order to mention Yetzi'as Mitzrayim -- we already mentioned it in Shema!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say Emes v'Yatziv and not Shema!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Keri'as Shema is preferable, for it has Kabalas Ol Malchus Shamayim <i>and</i> Yetzi'as Mitzrayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If one is unsure whether or not he said Keri'as Shema, he must say it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one is unsure whether or not he prayed Shemoneh Esreh, he need not pray again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If only we could pray the entire day (i.e. one <i>should</i> pray again out of doubt)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one was praying and remembered that he already prayed, he stops, even in the middle of a Berachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rabah bar Avuha was asked about one who realized that he was saying a weekday Berachah during the Shabbos Shemoneh Esreh, and he answered that he should finish the Berachah (and complete Shemoneh Esreh of Shabbos)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There it is different -- really, the person should say all the Berachos even on Shabbos; Chachamim did not place this obligation on him on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But if one already prayed, he need not pray again!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one prayed and entered a synagogue where people are praying:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he can pray for something new (Rambam - in every, or at least one, of the middle Berachos; Rema - a need that arose after his previous Shemoneh Esreh), he should pray with them; if not, not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Rav Yehudah must teach both laws:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had he only taught the first law, one might have thought that is only if both times he prayed by himself or with a Tzibur, but if one who prayed alone can now pray with a Tzibur, it is as if he did not pray;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had he only taught the second law, one might have thought that is because he did not begin yet, but if he began, he must finish.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ANSWERING WITH THE <i>TZIBUR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If one entered a synagogue where people are praying:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he can begin and finish before the Shali'ach Tzibur (in his repitition of Shemoneh Esreh) will reach Modim, he should begin; if not, not (it is more important to bow with the Tzibur at Modim than to pray together with the Tzibur).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> If he can begin and finish before the Shali'ach Tzibur reaches Kedushah, he should begin; if not, not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Huna holds that an individual (praying with a Tzibur) says Kedushah (therefore, we are not concerned if he cannot say it with the Tzibur), R. Yehoshua ben Levi holds that an individual does not say Kedushah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> What is the source that an individual does not say Kedushah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "v'Nikdashti b'Soch Bnei Yisrael" -- every matter of Kedushah needs ten men.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we learn this from the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravnai, brother of R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Toch-Toch":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says here "v'Nikdashti b'Soch Bnei Yisrael," like it says about Adas Korach "mi'Toch ha'Edah." We learn "Edah-Edah" from "la'Edah ha'Ra'ah ha'Zos," which refers to the Meraglim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like there, there were ten (evil Meraglim), also here there must be ten (Jews).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>All agree that we do not interrupt Shemoneh Esreh to answer to Kedushah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do we interrupt Shemoneh Esreh to answer "Yehei Shemo ha'Gadol Mevorach" (in Kaddish)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> One interrupts anything to answer "Yehei Shemo ha'Gadol Mevorach," even Ma'aseh Merkavah (Yechezkel's prophecy of Hash-m's chariot).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>The Halachah does not follow Rav Dimi.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHAT MAY A <i>BA'AL KERI</i> SAY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> He blesses before and after.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This implies that R. Yehudah permits a Ba'al Keri to say Divrei Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Yehoshua ben Levi taught that he is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says, "v'Hodatam l'Vanecha uli'Venei Vanecha," followed by "Yom Asher Amadta" -- learning Torah is equated to Matan Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just as a Ba'al Keri could not participate in Matan Torah (this is why Bnei Yisrael were commanded to refrain from relations beforehand), he may not say Divrei Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps R. Yehudah [argues because he] does not expound Semuchim (adjacency of verses).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Yosef taught that all expound Semuchim in Sefer Devarim (because it is mostly repetition), even the opinion that does not expound Semuchim in the rest of Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that R. Yehudah does not expound Semuchim in the rest of Torah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Ben Azai):</span> It says, "Mechashefah Lo Sechayeh," followed by "Kol Shochev Im Behemah Mos Yumas," to teach that a witch is stoned, just like one who commits bestiality.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> Is the adjacency of the verses grounds to stone?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, Ov v'Yid'oni (sorcerers who conjure up the dead) are in the category of witches -- the Torah teaches that they are stoned, and this shows that all witches are stoned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that R. Yehudah expounds Semuchim in Sefer Devarim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> A man may marry a woman raped or enticed by his father or son;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>R. Yehudah forbids him to marry a woman raped or enticed by his father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span>(It is not clear why the Gemara cites this Beraisa instead of the Mishnah (Yevamos 97a) -- the following teaching was taught to explain R. Yehudah's opinion in the Mishnah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal):</span> R. Yehudah learns from "Lo Yikach... v'Lo Yegaleh Kenaf Aviv" -- a man may not take a woman who was intimate with his father.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that it refers to a woman his father raped?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We know this from the previous verse -- "v'Nasan ha'Ish ha'Shochev Imah..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of question:</span> Since R. Yehudah expounds Semuchim in Devarim, he should connect "v'Hodatam l'Vanecha..." to "Yom Asher Amadta," and forbid a Ba'al Keri to learn Torah, just like at Matan Torah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah expounds this adjacency to teach something else that R. Yehoshua ben Levi taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> If one teaches Torah to his son, the Torah considers it as if he received Torah from Sinai:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It says "v'Hodatam l'Vanecha uli'Vnei Vanecha," followed by "Yom Asher Amadta... b'Chorev."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>(If a man has two emissions of Zivah, he becomes a Zav, and he cannot become Tahor until counting seven clean days (i.e. free of emissions).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> The following must immerse (before saying Divrei Torah) -- a Zav who had a seminal emission, a Nidah who discharged semen, and a woman who became Nidah after relations;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> R. Yehudah exempts a Zav, for the decree did not apply to him when he first became Tamei (and now immersion will not be Metaher him), but he agrees that a [regular] Ba'al Keri must immerse!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he exempts even a Ba'al Keri, and the Mishnah discusses a Zav to teach the extremity of Chachamim's opinion!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> A woman who became a Nidah after relations...</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was this clause taught?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is to teach that Chachamim require her to immerse.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They require even a Zav to immerse, even though he was Tamei before he was subject to Ezra's decree; they need not teach about one who was subject to Ezra's decree (on account of relations) before she became Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is to teach that R. Yehudah exempts her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He exempts her only because the immersion would not be Metaher her now (she still must wait seven days), but a Ba'al Keri is obligated!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> In the Mishnah, R. Yehudah does not say that a Ba'al Keri <i>blesses</i> before and after, rather, he <i>thinks</i> (Meharher) the blessings in his mind.</p>
