<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> If not for three verses (which say that only Hash-m can remove the Yetzer ha'Ra), the haters of Yisrael (a euphemism for Yisrael) would falter in judgment;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They are "va'Asher Hare'osi," "Hineh cha'Chomer b'Yad ha'Yotzer Ken Atem b'Yadi Beis Yisrael," and "va'Hasirosi Es Lev ha'Even mi'Besarchem v'Nasati Lachem Lev Basar."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> We learn this from, "v'Es Ruchi Eten b'Kirbechem v'Asisi Asher b'Chukosai Telechu."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Moshe spoke sharply to Hash-m;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Va'Yispalel Moshe El Hash-m" -- we read this "<i>Al</i> Hash-m," for d'Vei R. Eliezer ben Yakov expound "Aleph" as if it was "Ayin" and vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> We learn this from "v'Di Zahav";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Moshe said, "The gold and silver that you gave to Yisrael (when leaving Mitzrayim) until they said 'Dai' (enough!) caused them to make the golden calf";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(D'Vei R. Yanai):</span> A lion does not roar (and damage) when it has a basket of straw, rather, when it has a basket of meat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshiya):</span> A parable: a man had a lean cow with long limbs. He fed it vetch, and it kicked him. He said, the vetch caused you to kick me!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> A parable: a man bathed his son, anointed him, gave to him to eat and drink, hung a wallet (with money) on his neck and put him in front of the door to a house of harlots -- surely, he will sin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha brei d'Rav Huna):</span> This is like people say, "A full stomach is a type of evil" -- "K'Mar'isam va'Yisba'u Sav'u va'Yaram Libam Al Ken Shechechuni."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> We learn from, "v'Ram Levavecha v'Shachachta Es Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> We learn from "v'Achal v'Sava v'Dashen u'Fanah," or from "va'Yishman Yeshurun va'Yiv'at."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> What is the source that Hash-m agreed to Moshe?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Kesef Hirbesi Lahem v'Zahav Asu la'Ba'al."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [When Yisrael made the Egel,] "va'Yedaber Hash-m El Moshe <i>Lech Red</i>" -- what does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> Hash-m told him to descend from his greatness: "I elevated you on account of Yisrael; now that they sinned, you return to your previous level."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Moshe became weak and unable to speak.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When Hash-m said, "Heref Mimeni v'Ashmidem" (leave Me alone and I will destroy them), Moshe understood that if he will pray, Hash-m could pardon Yisrael; he invigorated himself and prayed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">A parable:</span> a king was striking his son severely; the king's friend was watching, but feared to say anything;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The king told his son, "If my friend was not here, I would kill you" -- the friend realized that it is upon him to persuade the king to spare his son.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> "V'Atah Hanichah Li va'Yichar Api Vahem..." -- if this was not written, it would be forbidden to say this; it was as if Moshe was "holding" Hash-m, like one holds a person by his garment, and refused to let go until Hash-m forgave Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "V'E'eseh Oscha l'Goy Gadol" -- Moshe told Hash-m, if a chair of three legs (a nation founded by three Avos) cannot stand in front of Your anger, all the more so a chair of one leg (a nation You propose to make from me)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, I will be embarrassed in front of my Avos -- they will say that I was an unworthy leader, that I sought my own greatness and did not pray for Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MOSHE'S DEFENSE OF YISRAEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "<i>Va'Yechal</i> Moshe Es Penei Hash-m" -- Moshe prayed for Yisrael to the point of becoming Chulin (Maharsha, based on Shemos Rabah - he spoke harshly to Hash-m).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> He prayed until Hash-m annulled His "vow" (to destroy Yisrael) -- "va'Yechal" is like "Lo Yachel Devaro";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may not profane his own word (vow), but others may [annul it].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Moshe was willing to die (become a Chalal, i.e. corpse) for Yisrael -- "v'Im Ein Mecheni Na mi'Sifrecha"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> He caused Hash-m's attribute of mercy Lachul (to rest) on Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> He said to Hash-m, "It is Chulin (sacrilege) for you to destroy Yisrael."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> "<i>Va'Yechal</i> Moshe Es Penei Hash-m" -- Moshe prayed for Yisrael until he was seized by "Achilu."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What it Achilu?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> It is fire of the bones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is a fever.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Zechor l'Avraham... Asher Nishbata Lahem <i>Bach</i>" -- what does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> Moshe said, "Had You sworn (to the Avos) by heaven and earth, I would say, just like they are not permanent, also your oath;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But You swore by Your great name -- just like Your name is eternal, also your oath!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Tedaber Aleihem Arbeh Es Zar'achem k'Chochvei ha'Shamayim v'Chol ha'Aretz ha'Zos Asher <i>Amarti</i>" -- the citation of Hash-m's words ends with "k'Chochvei ha'Shamayim," Moshe should have said "v'Chol ha'Aretz ha'Zos Asher <i>Amarta</i>"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> Moshe said until "k'Chochvei ha'Shamayim," Hash-m said the rest of the verse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> Moshe said the entire verse;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the end of the verse, Moshe says, "I told Bnei Yisrael (that You will bring them to Eretz Yisrael) like You told me (at the burning bush)" -- what should I tell them now (if You will not do so)?"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "Mi'Bilti <i>Yecholes</i> Hash-m" -- it should say "Yachol"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> Moshe said, nations will say that Your strength became weak, like a female, and You cannot save [them from the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> They already saw My miracles and My might at the splitting of the Sea!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Moshe:</span> They will say that You overcame one king (Pharoah), but could not overcome the 31 kings of Eretz Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Hash-m agreed with Moshe -- "Salachti ki'Devarecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Ki'Devarecha" -- as you (Moshe) argued, that the nations will say so in the future;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Happy is the Talmid whose Rebbi agrees with him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "V'Ulam Chai Ani" -- Hash-m told Moshe, "You gave life to Me" [in the eyes of the nations, who would have doubted My power].</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE GREATNESS OF PRAYER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Simlai):</span> One should praise Hash-m before praying (requests); we learn from Moshe -- "Hash-m... Hachilosa l'Har'os Es Avdecha Es Gadlecha... E'ebrah Na v'Er'eh Es ha'Aretz."</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">32b----------------------------------------32b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Prayer is greater than Mitzvos:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>No one has more Mitzvos than Moshe had, yet his Mitzvos did not enable him to enter Eretz Yisrael; in the merit of his prayer, he was allowed to look at it -- "Al Tosef Daber Alai... Aleh Rosh ha'Pisgah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Fasting is greater than giving Tzedakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A fast involves one's body, Tzedakah involves one's money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Prayer is greater than Korbanos -- "Lamah Li Rov Zivcheichem... uv'Farsechem Kapeichem..." (even after Hash-m said that He does not desire our Korbanos, it was necessary to say that even prayer will not be accepted).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> A Kohen who killed someone may not recite Birkas Kohanim -- "Yedeichem Damim Male'u."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> After the Churban, the gates of prayer were closed -- "... Sasam Tefilasi";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though the gates of prayer were closed, the gates of tears were not closed -- "Shim'ah Sefilasi Hash-m v'Shav'asi Ha'azinah El Dim'asi Al Techerash" (one must pray that one's prayer will be heard, but one need not pray that tears will be seen, only that they be accepted).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rava would not decree a fast on a cloudy day (because the prayers would not be accepted easily) -- "Sakosa ve'Anan Lach me'Avor Tefilah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> After the Churban an iron wall separates between Yisrael and Hash-m -- "... Kir Barzel Beincha u'Vein ha'Ir."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanin):</span> Anyone who prays at length, his prayer will have an effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn from Moshe -- "va'Espalel El Hash-m... va'Yishma Hash-m Elai Gam ba'Pa'am ha'Hi."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Chiya bar Aba taught that anyone who prays at length and anticipates that it will be answered will come to heartache -- "Tocheles Memushachah Machalah Lev"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What remedy can he take?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He should engage in Torah -- "v'Etz Chayim Ta'avah Va'ah"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If one prays at length without anticipating results, it will have an effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he expects to be answered, this arouses mention of his sins (and causes that his prayer will not be answered).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> If one prays and is not answered, he should pray again -- "Kaveh El Hash-m Chazak v'Ya'ametz Libecha v'Kaveh El Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One must invigorate himself regarding four things -- Torah, good deeds, prayer and livelihood;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn Torah and good deeds from "Rak Chazak ve'Ematz Me'od Lishmor k'Chol ha'Torah" -- "Chazak" in Torah, and "ve'Ematz" in good deeds;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We learn prayer from "Kaveh El Hash-m Chazak v'Ya'ametz...";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We learn livelihood from "Chazak v'Nischazek b'Ad Amenu..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Tomer Tziyon Azavani Hash-m va'Hashem Shechechani" -- what is the difference between "Azavani" and "Shechechani"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> Keneses Yisrael says to Hash-m, "When a man takes a second wife, he remembers the deeds of his first wife (even though he somewhat abandons her) -- You abandoned and forgot me!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> I created 12 constellations, there are 30 generals for each, there are 30 lieutenants for each general, there are 30 captains for each lieutenant, there are 30 sergeants for each captain, there are 30 officers for each sergeant, for each officer there are 365 times 10 million stars, corresponding to the number of days in a solar year;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>I created all of them just for you -- I did not forget or abandon you!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Ha'Sishkach Ishah Ulah" (will a woman forget her baby?) -- will I forget the Olos and Bechoros that you offered to me in the Midbar?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Keneses Yisrael:</span> Since You do not forget, perhaps You will not forget the Egel?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> "Gam <i>Eleh</i> Sishkachnah" (it will be forgotten, also that you said "Eleh Elohecha Yisrael").</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Keneses Yisrael:</span> Since You allow things to be forgotten, perhaps You will forget Ma'amad Har Sinai?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> "v'Anochi Lo Eshkachech" (I will not forget "Anochi Hash-m Elokecha").</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>This is like R. Elazar taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Gam Eleh Sishkachnah" refers to the Egel, "v'Anochi Lo Eshkachech" refers to Ma'amad Har Sinai.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>PREPARATION FOR PRAYER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chasidim of old would wait one hour...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> We learn from "Ashrei Yoshvei Veisecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> One must wait one hour after praying -- "Ach Tzadikim Yodu li'Shmecha Yeshvu Yesharim Es Panecha" (after praising Hash-m, they remain in His presence).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> One who prays must wait one hour before praying and one hour after -- it says "Ashrei Yoshvei Veisecha," and "Ach Tzadikim..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Chasidim of old would wait one hour before praying, spend one hour in prayer, and wait one hour after praying;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> They spent nine hours a day in prayer, leaving little time for Torah or livelihood -- how did they remember their Torah and make a livelihood?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because they were Chasidim, Hash-m enabled them to remember their Torah and He blessed their livelihood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Even if the king greets a person during prayer, he should not answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> This refers only to a Jewish king, but if a Nochri king greets him, he should answer (lest the king kill him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one was praying and saw an extortionist or wagon coming towards him, he should not interrupt, rather he should shorten his prayer (omit the middle of the remaining blessings) and leave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If it is possible to finish quickly, he should do so; if not, he should interrupt.</p>
