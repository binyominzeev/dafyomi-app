<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>BREAD MADE FOR <i>KUTACH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya - Beraisa #1):</span> Bread made for Kutach (it was baked in the sun, not in an oven) is exempt from Chalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> Chalah must be taken from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Resolution (Seifa of Beraisa #2 - R. Yehudah):</span> Its shape reveals the intent -- if it was formed into thick buns (i.e. it was intended to be bread), it is obligated; if it is in strips, it is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> What blessing do we make on Kuva d'Ar'a?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Do you think that it is bread?! No, it is merely [baked] dough, one blesses Borei Minei Mezonos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Mar Zutra established his meal on it; he blessed ha'Motzi and Birkas ha'Mazon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> [If it is Matzah,] one can fulfill the Mitzvah of Matzah with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is "Lechem Ani" (poor man's bread).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THINGS THAT CHANGED FORM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> One blesses sheha'Kol on date honey.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a mere extract, it is not the essence of the fruit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">This is like the following Tana:</span> Rebbi Yehoshua</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If Terumah fruit was used to make date honey, apple wine, vinegar (from grapes that never ripen), or other fruit juice:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If a non-Kohen drinks it by accident, he gives juice of Chulin to the Kohen (and it becomes Terumah); he gives as much as he ate plus an added fifth.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yehoshua exempts [from the added fifth, if it belonged to a Kohen; if it had not yet been given to a Kohen, he is totally exempt).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (a Talmid):</span> What is the law of Trima (something crushed, not minced)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava did not understand the question.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> Do you refer to [oil of] crushed sesame, or crushed saffron (which is added to wine), or crushed grapes (to make raisin wine from the pits)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rava now understood, and said, "Surely, you ask about something crushed; you reminded me of Rav Asi's teaching":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> It is permitted to crush Terumah dates (they are still considered dates), it is forbidden to make beer from them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The Halachah is, one blesses Borei Pri ha'Etz on crushed dates.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are still considered dates.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One blesses sheha'Kol on Shesisa (made of flour ground from parched grain, oil and water).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One blesses Borei Minei Mezonos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> They do not argue -- Shmuel discusses thick Shesisa, Rav discusses thin Shesisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Thick Shesisa is made to be eaten, thin Shesisa is for a cure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> All agree that one may mix Shesus on Shabbos, and one may drink Zesum ha'Mitzri (a drink that relieves constipation or diarrhea).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shesisa was for a cure, it would be forbidden to make it on Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Surely, it is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may eat and drink any food and drink (normally eaten by healthy people) for the sake of a cure on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> You must say that he intends it as food; here also, he intends it as food!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> You must say, he intends it as food, and incidentally he is cured as well; here also, he intends it as food, and incidentally he is cured as well!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>We need Rav's teaching:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah teaches only that when he intends it as food, we are not concerned that incidentally he is also cured, but when he intends to be cured, one might have thought that he does not bless at all; Rav teaches, this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE BLESSING FOR BREAD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On bread we say ha'Motzi...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One says <i>ha'Motzi</i> Lechem Min ha'Aretz;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Nechemyah says, one says <i>Motzi</i> Lechem Min ha'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> All agree that "Motzi" means "He <i>took</i> out" -- "Kel Motzi'am mi'Mitzrayim" (said after Yetzi'as Mitzrayim) -- they argue about "ha'Motzi";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say that it also means took out -- "ha'Motzi Lecha Mayim mi'Tzur ha'Chalamish";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Nechemyah says that it means "He will take out" -- "ha'Motzi Eschem mi'Tachas Sivlos Mitzrayim" (this was said before Yetzi'as Mitzrayim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim explain, Hash-m told Yisrael, "When I will take you out, I will do wonders for you to make you know that I took you out" -- "vi'Yedatem Ki Ani Hash-m Elokechem ha'Motzi..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rabanan were praising Rav Zevid's son to R. Zeira, that he is a great sage and an expert in the laws of blessings; Rav Zevid's son once visited R. Zeira and said "Motzi" on bread.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> They say that he is an expert on Berachos?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had he said "ha'Motzi," we would have learned the meaning of the verse and that the Halachah follows Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">38b----------------------------------------38b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But by saying "Motzi," he did not teach us anything!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>He said "Motzi" to fulfill his obligation according to all opinions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The Halachah follows Chachamim, one says ha'Motzi, it means "took out."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE BLESSING FOR <i>SHELAKOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On Yerek (vegetables) we say...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Yerek was taught immediately after bread, to teach that the Mishnah is referring to a type of Yerek that is like bread, i.e. it changed through fire (cooking or baking);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Ravnai):</span> This teaches that one blesses Borei Pri ha'Adamah on Shelakos (cooked vegetables).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda citing Rav):</span> One blesses Borei Pri ha'Adamah on Shelakos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Ula citing R. Yochanan):</span> One blesses sheha'Kol.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Ula himself):</span> [Rav and R. Yochanan do not argue.] Anything for which we say [when raw] Borei Pri ha'Adamah, if it was cooked we say sheha'Kol; anything for which we say [when raw] sheha'Kol, if it was cooked we say Borei Pri ha'Adamah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand the latter clause -- [it refers to vegetables such as] cabbage, beets and gourds [that are normally eaten cooked]; when raw the blessing is sheha'Kol, when cooked it is Borei Pri ha'Adamah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But on what do we bless Borei Pri ha'Adamah when it is raw, and sheha'Kol when it is cooked?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It applies to garlic and leeks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> One blesses Borei Pri ha'Adamah on Shelakos; Ula cited R. Yochanan to say sheha'Kol;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> I say that they argue (like the following Tana'im):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> One may fulfill the Mitzvah of eating Matzah with a wafer [even if it was] soaked [in water], or if it was cooked but did not dissolve;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, one is Yotzei with a soaked wafer, but not if it was cooked, even if it did not dissolve.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>(R. Yosi holds that cooked bread is not called bread; likewise, cooking changes the blessing for the food; R. Meir holds that cooking changes neither.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all agree that one blesses Borei Pri ha'Adamah on Shelakos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi disqualifies cooked Matzah because it loses the taste of Matzah, but he agrees that vegetables do not lose their Berachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba citing R. Yochanan):</span> One blesses Borei Pri ha'Adamah on Shelakos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Binyamin bar Yefes citing R. Yochanan):</span> One blesses sheha'Kol.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Ula adopted R. Binyamin's mistake.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> Why do we mention R. Binyamin's opinion with R. Chiya bar Aba's?! R. Chiya bar Aba learns meticulously from R. Yochanan and reviews his learning every 30 days in front of R. Yochanan, R. Binyamin does neither of these;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Also, R. Yochanan said that one blesses Borei Pri ha'Adamah on Tormesa (a bean) that is cooked seven times in a pot and eaten for dessert.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> I saw R. Yochanan eat a salted (i.e. pickled) olive, he blessed before and after eating it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand this if Shelakos retain their blessing (pickling is like cooking); he blessed Borei Pri ha'Etz beforehand, and me'Ein Shalosh afterwards;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But if Shelakos lose their blessing, he blessed sheha'Kol beforehand, but what did he bless afterwards?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps he blessed Borei Nefashos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yitzchak bar Shmuel - Mishnah):</span> One may fulfill the Mitzvah of Maror by eating the vegetables (that are considered Maror) or their stalks, but not if they were pickled, Shelukim (thoroughy cooked) or cooked.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shelakos keep their original status, one should fulfill the Mitzvah of Maror with them even if they were cooked!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is not Yotzei because we require the taste of Maror, which is lost through cooking.</p>
