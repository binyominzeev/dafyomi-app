<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WAGES FOR TEACHING TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that even where wages are paid both for teaching written Torah and Medrash, one may take only for written Torah, but not for Medrash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't he take for Medrash?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Moshe said "Hash-m commanded me to teach you" and "I taught you statutes and laws like Hash-m commanded me";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like I taught you for free, you must teach for free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This should show that one must teach also written Torah for free!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> One may receive wages for guarding (young) Talmidim (who learn written Torah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> One may receive wages for teaching the cantillation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Reuven may not teach to Simchah written Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand this according to R. Yochanan,</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But according to Rav, does one pay for watching an adult?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, Simchah is a minor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Seifa):</span> He may teach to Simchah's children written Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Simchah is a minor, he cannot have children!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated. The full Mishnah says: Reuven may not teach to Simchah written Torah. This is when Simchah is a minor. If Simchah is an adult, Reuven may teach to him and his children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Children do not learn new things on Shabbos, but they may do (even) the first review of what they learned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like the opinion that wages are taken for teaching the cantillation. (Therefore, only the first time is forbidden, for then the Rebbi is paid.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if wages are for guarding the children, why do we forbid new things and permit review? The same wages for guarding them apply when they review!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> This is difficult even if wages are for the cantillation. One may receive wages for work done on Shabbos, together with wages for work done during the week!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one hired a worker to guard (for the needs of Hekdesh) a child, a red heifer, or crops, he does not receive wages for Shabbos. Therefore, if they were lost (or became Tamei, on Shabbos), he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">37b----------------------------------------37b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If he was hired by the week, month, year or Shemitah cycle, he receives wages for Shabbos. Therefore, he must pay if they are lost.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to question and counter-question):</span> Rather, they do not learn new things on Shabbos, so that their fathers can enjoy Shabbos with their children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They do not learn new things on Shabbos because they are less alert, because they eat and drink more.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Change in routine is the start of intestinal sickness.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>COMPONENTS OF WRITTEN TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't R. Yochanan answer like Rav?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One need not watch girls (they do not normally go outside, nevertheless one may receive wages for teaching them. Some texts say 'one need not watch adults' (Ran).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav answer like R. Yochanan?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav holds that the cantillation is also mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "They read in the Sefer Torah of Hash-m" refers to the written Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Explicitly" refers to the (Aramaic) translation;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"They put their minds" refers to the divisions into verses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"And they understood the written Torah" refers to the cantillation;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Some say that this refers to the tradition of extra or missing letters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> The following are traditions from Moshe from Sinai: vowelization; embellishments in the text; and words that are read but not written, or written but not read. The following are examples:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Vowelization - when "Eretz" has the cantillation Asnachta, it is pronounced "Aretz." We read "Shamayim", "Mitzrayim", not 'Shamim, Mitzrim'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Embellishments in the text - "after(wards) you will pass", "After" is there only to beautify the wording.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Words which are read but not written - "Paras" (in "In his going...").</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Words that are written but not read - "Na" (in "Forgive...").</p>
