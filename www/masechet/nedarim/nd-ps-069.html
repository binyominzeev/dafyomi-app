<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IF ONLY THE <i>ARUS</i> OR FATHER ANNULLED (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa):</span> If the father heard her vow and annulled it and the Arus died before he heard it, the father can annul the portion of her vow that remained to the Arus;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Nasan says, this is Beis Shamai's opinion. Beis Hillel say that he cannot annul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference (and summation of answer to Question 2:a, 68a):</span> Beis Shamai hold that the father cuts the vow. (The same applies to the Arus.) Beis Hillel hold that he weakens it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ANNULMENT OF AFFIRMATION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rava):</span> Can a father or husband (ask a Chacham and) permit his affirmation of a vow?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If you will say that he can, can he permit his annulment of a vow? (Affirmation is like a vow, so it is logical that it can be permitted. The only reason to say that annulment ca be permitted is because a Hekesh equates it to affirmation.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> R. Yochanan taught that one can permit his affirmation, but not his annulment. (Regarding this, they are not equated.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> If a father or husband said twice 'I affirm the vow', and he annulled the first affirmation, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava taught that if a man took the same oath twice, and he annulled the first, the second oath takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE WHO TRIES TO AFFIRM AND ANNUL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> If he said 'I affirm the vow, and it is annulled. My affirmation should not take effect unless the annulment takes effect', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">69b----------------------------------------69b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If one said 'this animal is Temurah (in place) of a Korban Olah, Temurah of a Korban Shelamim', it is Temuras Olah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi says, if he intended from the start to make it the Temurah of both, it is the Temurah of both, for a person cannot say two things at once (so we need not say that he retracted).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even R. Meir said that only his first words take effect only because he did not say 'this should not take effect unless this does'. When he says 'my affirmation should not take effect unless the annulment takes effect', R. Meir agrees that the annulment takes effect! (The annulment was not contingent on the affirmation.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> If he said 'your vow is affirmed and annulled at once', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from Rabah's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If two things cannot take effect one after the other (e.g. Kidushin with two sisters), if one tries to make them take effect at once, neither takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>QUESTIONABLE EXPRESSIONS OF ANNULMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rabah):</span> If he said 'Your vow is affirmed today', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is it as if he said 'it is annulled tomorrow'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or perhaps it is not, for he did not say it explicitly? (Ran - this implies that had he said so explicitly, surely it would be annulled. Later, Rabah implies otherwise. He was unsure.)</p>
