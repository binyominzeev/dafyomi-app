<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A <i>CHOLEH</i> WHO MAY NOT GIVE OR RECEIVE BENEFIT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was Mudar Hana'ah from Shimon, if he visits him when he is sick, he must stand; he may not sit. He may heal him, but he may not heal his property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Who may visit whom?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon visits Reuven, he should be allowed even to sit (since Shimon does a Mitzvah, this is not considered giving benefit)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven visits Shimon, he should be forbidden even to stand! (Reuven benefits from being allowed to walk in the house!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1A (Shmuel):</span> Shimon visits Reuven. The Mishnah discusses a place where people receive wages for visiting the sick when sitting, but not for standing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why would the Tana discuss such a case without specifying?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that even where people take money for visiting the sick, they may take only for sitting, not for standing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1B:</span> (Shimon visits Reuven.) Chachamim decree that he may not sit, lest he come to stay too long. (One may take money for staying extra long. Doing so for free is considered giving benefit.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Elyakim (42b) made a similar decree, lest one stand too long.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ula):</span> Really, Reuven visits Shimon. The vow did not forbid Reuven from providing Shimon with life essentials.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he should be allowed even to sit!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is possible to stand (it is not essential that Reuven sit).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If he fell sick, he may visit him. If his son fell sick, he may inquire about his welfare.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand according to Ula. The vow did not forbid Reuven (the visitor) from providing Shimon's life essentials (but it does not allow what is essential for Shimon's son).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But according to Shmuel, the visitor (Shimon) may not give benefit. It makes no difference whether the Choleh is Reuven or Reuven's son!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel agrees that in the Beraisa, the Choleh may not give benefit. He said that in the Mishnah, the visitor may not give benefit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Shmuel say that the Mishnah and Beraisa discuss different cases?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">39b----------------------------------------39b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> (The Beraisa can be explained only when the Choleh may not give benefit.) A difficulty forced Shmuel to explain the Mishnah differently.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we allow standing and forbid sitting?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that the visitor may not benefit the Choleh. (Shmuel did not accept Ula's answer (g).)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>KORACH'S REBELLION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "If they will die as normal people, and the visitation of normal people..." alludes to the Mitzvah of visiting the sick.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does it allude to this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "If they will die as normal people", i.e. sick and bedridden, and people visit them, (this will prove that) "Hash-m did not send me."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "If Hash-m will create a creation" - if Gehinom was already created, fine. If not, Hash-m should create it now.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Beraisa):</span> Seven things were created before the world: Torah, repentance, Gan Eden, Gehinom, the Kisei ha'Kavod (Hash-m's throne), the Beis ha'Mikdash, and the name of Mashi'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Torah - "Hash-m acquired me, the beginning of His way."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Teshuvah - "Before the mountains were born... You return man until he is crushed (and say 'return, men')."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Gan Eden - "Hash-m planted a garden in Eden, from before."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Gehinom - "For arranged from before is Tafteh (the place for one who is Mispateh (seduced) by his Yetzer ha'Ra)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>The Kisei ha'Kavod - "Secure is Your throne, from then."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>The Beis ha'Mikdash - "The throne of glory, elevated from the first (the place of our Mikdash)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>The name of Mashi'ach - "His name will be forever (before the sun, Yinon is his name)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Moshe said 'If the mouth (of Gehinom) was already created, fine. If not, Hash-m should create it now.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> "There is nothing new under the sun"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if the mouth is not near here, may Hash-m bring it close.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> What is the meaning of "The sun, the moon stood in Zvul (one of the seven levels of Heaven)"? The sun and moon are in Raki'a (a lower level of Heaven)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> They ascended to Zvul to petition Hash-m: If you will stand up for Moshe, we will illuminate. If not, we will not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m shot arrows at the sun and moon. 'Every day, people bow to you, and you did not protest for My honor, but you protest for the honor of flesh and blood!'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>From then on, every day Hash-m shoots arrows and spears at them and they illuminate - "They go by the light of Your arrows."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE GREATNESS OF <i>BIKUR</i> <i>CHOLIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There is no measure to Bikur Cholim (investigating the needs of the sick).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what sense is it unlimited?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> There is no limit to its reward.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> This implies that the reward of other Mitzvos is limited!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Be as careful about a light Mitzvah as about a severe one, for you do not know the reward of Mitzvos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> Even a great person should visit a lower person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> One should visit a sick person even 100 times in a day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Acha bar Chanina):</span> One who visits a sick person alleviates a 60th of his pain (some texts - sickness).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, 60 people should visit a sick person, and this will cure him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The sixtieth is like Rebbi's law of a 10th (brought below. Here, each visitor removes a 60th of the remaining sickness);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, only a person of the same Mazal removes a 60th of the sickness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> A daughter who is fed by her brothers (after their father died) receives a 10th of the estate when she gets married.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, if a man left 10 daughters and a son, the son will not receive anything!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rebbi):</span> The first daughter to get married receives a 10th of the estate. Each subsequent daughter receives a 10th of what remains.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they come to get married simultaneously, we calculate how much they would collectively receive (if they came in succession, i.e. about 63%), and they split this equally.</p>
