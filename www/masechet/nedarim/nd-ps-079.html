<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SILENCE IN ORDER TO ANNUL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (against R. Chanina - Rav Chisda - Beraisa):</span> There are stringencies of affirmation over annulment, and vice-versa. The following are stringencies of affirmation:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Silence affirms a vow, but does not annul it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he thought in his heart to affirm, it is affirmed. If he thought in his heart to annul, it is not annulled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he affirmed, he cannot annul. If he annulled, he cannot affirm. (This is not a stringency of either one.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Silence affirms, even if he was silent to vex her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, he was silent with intention to affirm.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, that is the same case as silence with intent to affirm!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he was silent without any specific intent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa said that there is a stringency of annulment over affirmation. What is it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> One can permit (nullify) affirmation. One cannot permit annulment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #3 (Rav Kahana - Beraisa):</span> "If her husband will be silent (her vow is affirmed)" - this discusses silence with intent to vex.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it discusses silence with intent to affirm!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Seifa of the verse "for he was silent" teaches this, so the Reisha must discuss silence with intent to vex.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This refutes R. Chanina.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the Reisha discusses silence without specific intent, and the Seifa discusses silence with intent to affirm!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn these two from the Reisha, for it says "Hacharesh Yacharish". Therefore, we learn a third case from the Seifa, i.e. silence with intent to vex. (Even though he was already refuted, we seek other refutations.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #4 (Rava - Mishnah):</span> If she vowed shortly before nightfall, he can annul only until nightfall. If he did not annul before nightfall, he can no longer annul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like silence with intent to vex (since he wanted to annul)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question #5 (Rav Ashi - Beraisa):</span> If a man says 'I knew about vows, but I did not know that they can be annulled', he can annul (on the day he learned about annulment);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir says, if he says 'I knew about annulment, but I did not know that this is a vow', he cannot annul;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, he can annul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This is like silence with intent to vex (since he wanted to annul)!</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK V'ELU NEDARIM</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHICH VOWS MAY BE ANNULLED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following vows may be annulled:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Vows of affliction, e.g. 'if I will wash, or not'; 'If I will adorn myself, or not'.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">79b----------------------------------------79b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> These are not vows of affliction. Rather, if she said, 'Peros of the world are forbidden to me', he can annul;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she said 'Peros of this province are forbidden to me', (he cannot annul. Rather,) he brings her Peros of a different province;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she said 'Peros of this grocer are forbidden to me', he cannot annul. If he gets all his Peros from that grocer, he can annul; this is R. Yosi's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> He can also annul vows that are not of affliction!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter" teaches that a husband can annul vows (that disrupt the relationship) between them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He can also annul vows between them. The Mishnah teaches only vows of affliction, for these he annuls permanently;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Vows between them are annulled only for the duration of the marriage. If he divorces her, the vows take effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Mishnah - R. Yochanan ben Nuri):</span> He should annul, in case he will divorce her, and will not be able to remarry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that annulment helps even for after he divorces her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he can annul either type of vow permanently. The Mishnah teaches only vows of affliction, for he annuls them permanently, even if she will marry someone else;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Vows between them are annulled while she is married to him. If she marries someone else, they take effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mishnah means as follows. He can annul the following vows, and she is permitted no matter whom she is married to: vows of affliction...</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A VOW AGAINST WASHING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she said 'if I will wash...'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did she vow?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> She said 'Peros of the world are forbidden to me if I wash.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> If so, why can he annul? (This is not affliction!) She can avoid washing, and she can eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> If so (the first Tana considers it affliction, for perhaps she will wash), why does R. Yosi say 'this is not a vow of affliction'? Perhaps she will wash, and she will be forbidden to eat Peros!</p>
