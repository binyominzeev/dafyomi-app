<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>QUESTIONABLE EXPRESSIONS OF ANNULMENT (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If you will say that it is not annulled, if he said 'it is annulled tomorrow', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we say that he cannot annul tomorrow, for he affirmed today?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since he did not say that he affirms today, he really means that he annuls today?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> If you will say that since he affirmed it today, it is as if the vow persists tomorrow, what if he said 'it is affirmed for an hour'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is it as if he said 'it is annulled after an hour'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, it is not, for he did not say this explicitly?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #4:</span> If we do not consider it as if he said 'it is annulled after an hour', what if he explicitly said so ('it is affirmed for an hour, and then annulled')?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Once he affirmed it, it is affirmed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since the whole day he can affirm or annul, it is annulled?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> If a woman said 'I am a Nezirah' and her husband said 'also I', he cannot annul her Nezirus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we say that he affirmed her Nezirus only for a short time, for the sake of Hatfasah (to make himself a Nazir like her), and later he can annul it if he wants?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This teaches that once he affirms it (even for a short time), it is affirmed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2):</span> Saying 'also I' shows that he wants to permanently affirm her Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN THE FATHER OR <i>ARUS</i> DIES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the father (of a Na'arah Me'orasah) dies, the Arus does not receive authority to annul her vows (by himself);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If the Arus dies, the father receives authority to annul her vows (by himself). In this respect, a father has more privileges to annul than a husband does.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding a Bogeres, a husband has more privileges. He can annul her vows, but a father cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why doesn't the husband get authority to annul after the father dies, just like the father gets after the husband dies?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Even if her father died, she is considered) "a Na'arah in her father's house."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the husband dies, the father receives authority to annul her vows.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> "If Hayo Tihyeh (she will be Mekudeshes) to a man, and her vows are on her" equates her vows before her second Kidushin to her vows before her first;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">70b----------------------------------------70b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like the father can annul vows (by himself) before her first Kidushin, he can also do so (after she was widowed and) before her second Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this applies only to vows that her husband did not hear!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Those vows we already know from "when she is a Na'arah, in her father's house."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Regarding a Bogeres, a husband has more privileges. (He can annul her vows, but a father cannot.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He was Mekadesh her during Na'arus, and she became a Bogeres.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> When the father dies, she leaves his Reshus (jurisdiction), but the husband does not get authority to annul her vows alone. The same applies when she becomes a Bogeres!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he was Mekadesh her after Bagrus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learned this (in another Mishnah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #1):</span> If a Bogeres waited 12 months (during Eirusin, the Arus can annul her vows. Chachamim disagree, but all could agree that mid'Oraisa, he can annul!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah itself is difficult!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If she is a Bogeres, why must she wait 12 months? A Bogeres gets only one month to prepare for Nisu'in!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah means, a Bogeres or a girl who waited 12 months...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Question (m) is still unanswered. We already learned the case of a Bogeres!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Our Mishnah is primary. Mishnah #1 teaches that (this is not unanimous, for) R. Eliezer and Chachamim argue about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Mishnah #1 is primary. Our Mishnah merely shows that sometimes the husband has more authority to annul.</p>
