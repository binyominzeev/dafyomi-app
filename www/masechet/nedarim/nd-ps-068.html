<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE SOURCE THAT THEY ANNUL TOGETHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter" teaches that both must annul the vow of a Na'arah Me'orasah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he learn from "If she will be to a man"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns Rava's other law (70a. If an Arusah was widowed, her father can annul her vows until she remarries, just like he could annul her vows before her first Kidushin.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Rava learned joint annulment from "If she will be to a man.") What does Rava learn from Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael's verse ("Between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter")?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that a husband annuls vows that affect their relationship.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IF ONLY THE <i>ARUS</i> OR FATHER ANNULLED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When an Arus annuls alone, does he cut half the vow (but the remainder is a full-strength vow)? Or, does he weaken the vow?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she vowed from two olives, and her husband annulled the vow, and she ate the olives:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he cuts the vow (and does not weaken it), she is lashed;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If he weakens it, she is not lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Question:</span> When do we say that that if the Arus dies, the father gets back authority to annul? (The answer to Question (a) is from the Seifa of this long Beraisa, on 69a.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is when the Arus died without hearing the vow, or after he annulled it, or if he died on the day he heard it, before he acted on it;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">68b----------------------------------------68b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the Arus affirmed the vow, or was silent on the day he heard it and died on a later day, the father cannot annul it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the father heard her vow and annulled it and died before the Arus heard it, authority to annul does not pass to the Arus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If the Arus heard her vow and annulled it and died before the father heard it, authority to annul returns to the father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If the Arus heard her vow and annulled it and the father died before hearing it, the Arus cannot annul it, since he can annul only in partnership.</p>
