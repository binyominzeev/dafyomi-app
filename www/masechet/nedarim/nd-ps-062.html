<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>AFTER THE HARVEST</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If most of the knives for cutting figs were stored away, it is not considered stealing to take attached figs (i.e. they are Hefker), and they are exempt from Ma'asros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rebbi and R. Yosi bar R. Yehudah visited an area after most of the knives were stored away. Rebbi ate the figs; R. Yosi bar R. Yehudah did not. The owner of the tree came.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The owner:</span> Why aren't you eating the figs? Most of the knives have been stored away!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Still, R. Yosi bar R. Yehudah didn't eat. He thought that the owner was too ashamed to say that he didn't want them to eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Chama bar R. Chanina visited an area after most of the knives were stored away. He ate the figs; his attendant would not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Chama:</span> Eat! R. Yosi said that if most of the knives were stored away, it is not considered stealing, and they are exempt from Ma'asros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Tarfon was eating figs after most of the knives were stored away. The owner saw this, and put R. Tarfon in a sack. He was taking him to drown him in the river.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Tarfon wailed 'woe to Tarfon, that this man will kill you!' When the man heard whom he had seized, he fled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> The rest of R. Tarfon's life, he was pained that he had used the crown of Torah to save himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Anyone who uses the crown of Torah is uprooted from the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He learns a Kal v'Chomer from Belshatzar, who used Kelim of the Mikdash that had lost their Kedushah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"The coarse ones entered it and defiled it" - once they breached them, they became Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"On that night Belshatzar was killed" shows that he was uprooted from the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>All the more so, one who uses the crown of Torah, which is eternal, will be uprooted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since R. Tarfon was eating after most of the knives were stored away, why was the owner upset?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Thieves used to steal his grapes all year. He assumed that R. Tarfon was also a thief.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did R. Tarfon regret what he said?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Tarfon was very wealthy. He should have placated the owner by offering him money.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BENEFITING FROM TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "To love Hash-m, to listen to His voice, to cling to Him" - a person should not learn in order to be called a Chacham or a Rebbi, or to sit in a Yeshivah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, he should learn out of love, and in the end, honor will come - "Tie (words of Torah) on your fingers, write them on the tablet of your heart";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Its ways are ways of pleasantness, all its paths are peace". "It is a tree of life to those who grasp it; those who support it are happy."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer bar R. Tzadok):</span> Do things for the sake of (Hash-m) who made everything. Speak in (words of Torah) for their sake. Do not make them a crown to aggrandize yourself, nor an axe to dig (Rosh's text - cut) with.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn from a Kal v'Chomer from Belshatzar. He used Kodesh Kelim that had lost their Kedushah, and he was uprooted from the world. All the more so one who uses the crown of Torah will be uprooted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a Chacham is not recognized in a place, he may reveal himself - "(I, Ovadyah) your servant has feared Hash-m from his youth."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did R. Tarfon regret what he said?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Tarfon was very wealthy; he should have placated the owner by offering him money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rava):</span> Ovadyah said "Your servant has feared Hash-m from his youth." It says "Others should praise you, not your own mouth!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Resolution (Rava):</span> One may state his merits where he is not known, but not where he is known.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A Chacham may say 'I am a Chacham; judge my case first'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn this from "The sons of David were Kohanim." Just like a Kohen takes the first portion, also a Chacham.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We learn that a Kohen takes first from "You will sanctify him."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "You will sanctify him" for all matters of Kedushah: to read the Torah first, to bless first, to take a nice portion first.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">62b----------------------------------------62b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A Chacham may say 'I will not pay the head-tax.' "Mindah, Balu, and Halach will not be placed on them (Kohanim)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Mindah is the king's tax. Balu is head-tax. Halach is a tenth of all animals that the king takes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A Chacham may say 'I am a servant of the fire (which they will understand to mean, a priest who serves fire). I will not pay the head-tax'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this allowed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Clearly, he says this only to distance a lion (i.e. damage) from himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Rav Ashi owned a forest. He sold it to priests who served fire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> You transgress "V'Lifnei Iver Lo Siten Michshol" (causing someone to transgress)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Most wood is destined to be burned (not only for the sake of idolatry).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>UNTIL THE HARVEST</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'until the harvest', he is forbidden until people start harvesting;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This refers to the wheat harvest, not the barley harvest.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We follow the harvest in the place of the vow, be it in the mountain or valley.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one said 'until the rains', or 'until there is rain', he is forbidden until the second rains come;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, he is forbidden until the beginning of the second rain season.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Meir says, if one said 'until the rains stop', he is forbidden until the end of Nisan;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yehudah forbids until Pesach passes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Reuven was in Galil, and vowed until the Kayitz. He went to the valley. Even though it is Kayitz in the valley, he is forbidden until Kayitz in Galil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'until the rains'... R. Shimon ben Gamliel says...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> The Tana'im argue about one who said 'until the rains.' If he said 'until the rain', all agree that he means until the (usual) time of the rains.</p>
