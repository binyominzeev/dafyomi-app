<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IS DIVORCE LIKE AFFIRMATION? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa) Question:</span> When do we say that the father (of a Na'arah Me'orasah) gets Reshus to annul her vows (by himself) after she is widowed or divorced?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is if the Arus did not hear the vow, or heard it and annulled it, or was silent and died that day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If divorce is like silence, the Mishnah should also teach 'if he was silent and divorced her'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Divorce is like affirmation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Seifa connotes the opposite!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If the Arus affirmed the vow, or was silent and died on a later day, the father cannot annul it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If divorce is like affirmation, the Mishnah should also teach this case!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Divorce is like silence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The inferences from the Reisha and Seifa contradict each other, so we cannot settle the question from the Beraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not know which is precise (the inference may be made from it), and which (was taught for parallel structure and) is imprecise.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> An Arusah vowed; she was divorced that same day, and got was Mekadesh again the same day - even if she remarried 100 times that day, her father and the last Arus annul her vows.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that divorce is like silence. If it was as affirmation, the last Arus could not annul what the first Arus affirmed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the case is, the first Arus did not hear the vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does the Mishnah say that she remarried the same day? The same law would apply even if she remarried 100 days later!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the Arus did not hear, but the father heard;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since the father can annul only that day, she must remarry that day for joint annulment to be possible.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Mishnah):</span> If a girl vowed on the day she married, was divorced, and remarried her husband the same day, he cannot annul her vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that divorce is like affirmation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That Mishnah discusses Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He cannot annul when he remarries her, for the vow is considered like a vow that preceded the marriage (such vows can be annulled only together with the father. Once she had Nisu'in, the father has no Reshus over her.)</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ANNULMENT OF PREVIOUS VOWS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Chacham annuls his daughter's vows before she leaves his Reshus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He tells her 'all vows that you made in my house are annulled.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Similarly, a Ba'al annuls her vows before she enters his Reshus (Nisu'in).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After Nisu'in, he cannot annul prior vows.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rami bar Chama) Question:</span> Can a husband annul his wife's vows without hearing them?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is "her husband heard" essential, or not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava - Mishnah):</span> A Chacham annuls his daughter's vows before she leaves his Reshus. He tells her 'all vows that you made in my house are annulled.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that he annuls even without hearing them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (This annulment does not work.) He annuls them after he hears them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it doesn't work, why does he say it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Chacham strives to annul his daughter's vows (Perhaps this will prompt her to mention her vows.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> Similarly, a Ba'al annuls them before she enters his Reshus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Here also, he can truly annul them only after he hears them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Mishnah):</span> If a man told his wife 'all vows you take from now until I return from Ploni (a certain place) are affirmed', this has no effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer says, if he said 'they are annulled', they are annulled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This shows that he annuls them before he hears them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Here also, they are truly annulled only after he hears them. (Ran - some say that this happens automatically. Some say that he must annul them again.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does he say this now? He can annul them when he hears them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is concerned lest he be distracted when he hears them, and will forget to annul them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Beraisa - R. Yoshiyah):</span> If a man told an overseer 'annul all vows that my wife will make from now until I return from Ploni'; the overseer's annulment is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yonasan says, the rule is, if Reuven's Shali'ach did an act, it is as if Reuven did it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even R. Yoshiyah disqualifies the annulment only because it says "her husband will affirm (her vow), her husband will annul it". He agrees that normally, Reuven's Shali'ach's actions are attributed to Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The annulment works (or would work, if not for the verse), even though her husband did not hear the vow!</p>
