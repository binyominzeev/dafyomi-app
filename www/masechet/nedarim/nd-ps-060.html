<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DOES THE PART PLANTED BECOME <i>BATEL</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina Tirsa'ah):</span> If a Terumah onion was planted, and the added growth is more than the bulb, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Added permitted growth nullifies the forbidden bulb!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If Terumah is planted, the growth is Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Chanina referred to a case of planting an onion that grew from a planted Terumah onion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This was taught in a Mishnah. R. Chanina would not need to teach it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Gidulim of Gidulim of Terumah is not Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Chanina teaches even about something in which what is planted remains. (It does not disintegrate like seeds.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If Tevel is planted, if the seed disintegrates, the growth is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the seed remains, even the growth of the growth is forbidden (and all the more so, regarding Terumah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Chanina teaches that if the additional growth exceeds the amount planted, it is permitted.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>VOWS OF LIMITED DURATION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I will not taste wine today', it is forbidden only until nightfall. If he said 'this week', it is forbidden the entire week, including the coming Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'this month', it is forbidden the entire month, and Rosh Chodesh is considered part of the next month;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said 'this year', it is forbidden the entire year, and Rosh Hashanah is considered part of the next year;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he said 'this Shemitah cycle', it is forbidden the remainder of the cycle, including the coming Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said 'one day', 'one week', 'one month', 'one year', or 'one Shemitah', he is forbidden for that amount of time, from day to day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he said 'until Pesach', he is forbidden until Pesach comes. If he said 'until it will be Pesach', he is forbidden until the end of Pesach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Meir says, if he said 'until Lifnei Pesach', he is forbidden until it comes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yosi forbids until the end of Pesach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah):</span> If he said 'wine is forbidden to me today'...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah):</span> After dark, he must seek a Chacham to permit his vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> This is a decree due to the case when he says 'one day' (lest people think that also then it is permitted at night). .</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">60b----------------------------------------60b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, we should also decree when he says 'one day' due to when he says 'today'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> There is need for a decree only when he says 'today'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If when he says 'today' he is permitted at nightfall, he may come to think that the same applies when he says 'one day'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When he says 'one day', he is forbidden for 24 hours. This will not lead him to drink on the same day when he says 'today'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (h) - Ravina):</span> R. Yirmiyah holds like R. Nasan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nasan):</span> Vowing is like building a private Mizbe'ach (when this is forbidden). Completing the vow (i.e. not permitting it) is like offering a Korban on this Mizbe'ach. (Therefore, we fine him and require him to request permission.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW LONG IS HE FORBIDDEN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he said 'this week', he is forbidden the entire week.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he meant the weekdays. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he said 'this month', he is forbidden the entire month, and Rosh Chodesh counts as part of the next month.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It needs to teach the case where the (coming) month is a short (29 day) month;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that (the first day of) Rosh Chodesh counts like the 30th day of this month, and he is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. People call it the beginning of the coming month.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he said 'this year', he is forbidden the entire year...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he said 'wine is forbidden to me for a day', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is this considered like 'today', or like 'one day'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If he said 'wine is forbidden to me today', it is forbidden only until nightfall.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he said 'a day', it would be forbidden for 24 hours.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Seifa):</span> If he said 'one day', he is forbidden for 24hours.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he said 'a day', he would be permitted at nightfall!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One of these inferences must be invalid. We cannot settle our question from the Mishnah.</p>
