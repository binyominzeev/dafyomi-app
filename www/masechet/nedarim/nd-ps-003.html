<p class="dedicationbox"><br>12TH CYCLE DEDICATION<br>NEDARIM 2-5 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the eighth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE ORDER OF THE <i>MISHNAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the Tana is not particular. Sometimes he begins with the first matter, and sometimes with the last law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Our Tana explains Yados first because they are expounded from a verse (so the law is dearer to him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he should teach about Yados first!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He taught Kinuyim first, because they are mid'Oraisa (and are well known; they need not be expounded). He explains Yados first, because they are expounded.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that Kinuyim are the words Nochrim use for these matters. According to the opinion that Chachamim invented Kinuyim, how can we answer? (Even if this opinion agrees that Kinuyim are mid'Oraisa, they are not known more than Yados!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Mishnah did not explicitly teach Yados. We said that it is abbreviated. We can say that the full version teaches Yados first, as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Every Yad for a Neder is like saying the full Neder. Every Kinuy for a Neder is like saying 'Neder'. The following are Yados - if one said... The following are Kinuyim: Konam, Konach...</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE SOURCE FOR <i>YADOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> From which verse do we derive Yados?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from "Ish...Ki Yafli Lindor Neder Nazir Lehazir la'Shem";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Nazir Lehazir" teaches that Kinuyim and Yados work for Nezirus. (We do not learn Kinuyim from the verse. 'Kinuyim' was taught needlessly (Rosh), or should be deleted from the text (Ran).)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about Nezirus. What is the source regarding Nedarim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Neder Nazir" equates Nedarim and Nezirus to each other:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like Yados work for Nezirus, also for Nedarim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Just like one who transgresses a Neder or delays fulfilling a Neder (to bring a Korban) transgresses 'Bal Yachel' and 'Bal Te'acher', the same applies to Nezirus;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Just like a father or husband can annul the Nedarim of his daughter or wife, he can annul her Nezirus;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learned Yados Nezirus from "Nazir Lehazir." We should likewise learn Yados Nedarim from "Lindor Neder"! (Why must we learn from a Hekesh?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said "Neder Lindor", this would be correct. "Lindor Neder" is grammatically normal. The Torah speaks as people do; we do not expound it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that the Torah speaks as people do (and we need not expound it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that disagrees (and expounds every extra word), what do we learn from "Lindor Neder"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question (a)):</span> It teaches that Yados of Nedarim are like Nedarim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Hekesh teaches that Yados of Nezirus are like Nezirus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He expounds "Nazir Lehazir" to teach that if a Nazir accepted Nezirus, it takes effect (he must fulfill another term of Nezirus after his current Nezirus).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">3b----------------------------------------3b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the other opinion, how do we know that one can accept a double Nezirus?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not difficult according to the opinion that Nezirus does not take effect on Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to the opinion that Nezirus takes effect on Nezirus, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Torah wrote "Lehazir" instead of 'Lizor' to teach this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (and Answer #3 to Question (a) - Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> Some learn Yados from Lindor Neder, and some learn from "k'Chol ha'Yotzei mi'Piv Ya'aseh." (Ran - the latter verse also teaches that Nezirus takes effect on Nezirus.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>ISURIM</i> LEARNED FROM <i>NEDARIM</i> TO <i>NEZIRUS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, one can transgress (only) Bal Yachel of Nedarim if he vowed to eat a loaf and did not eat it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>How can one transgress (only) Bal Yachel of Nezirus?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he eats (grapes), he (also) transgresses Bal Yochal (the Isur to eat). If he drinks wine, he (also) transgresses Bal Yishteh (the Isur to drink)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> He also transgresses Bal Yachel for Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can Bal Te'acher apply to Nezirus?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Once he says 'I am a Nazir', (he is immediately a Nazir.) If he eats (grapes), he transgresses Bal Yochal. If he drinks wine, he transgresses Bal Yishteh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, he said "When I want, I will be a Nazir."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> But in such a case, there is never Bal Te'acher!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> It applies when he said 'I will be a Nazir before I die.' He is (obligated to become) a Nazir immediately;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like a Kohen who gave a Get and said that it will take effect just before he dies. His wife is immediately forbidden to eat Terumah, lest he die right away;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also here, he is (obligated to become) a Nazir immediately, lest he die right away!</p>
