<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>VOWS OF PERSUASION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Aba bar Mamal, to R. Ami):</span> You said that R. Yehudah Nesi'ah (the grandson of Rebbi) said that our Mishnah is like R. Yehudah, citing R. Tarfon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Tarfon):</span> (If six men saw a man walking towards them, and each of them accepted Nezirus contingent on the identity of the man, or on whether or not their colleagues became Nezirim,) none of them is a Nazir, for Nezirus requires Hafla'ah (a definite acceptance. Nedarim are equated to Nezirus.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Our Mishnah is even like Chachamim. It does not say that they (later) agreed upon three, rather, (when they vow) they each want three.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> If the seller vowed to charge (at least a Perutah) more than a Sela, and the buyer vowed to pay less than a Shekel, are these proper vows, or are they vows of persuasion (that are permitted? We cannot learn from the Mishnah, for here they are more precise, or because their offers are further apart.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was refusing to eat by Shimon, and Reuven vowed not to enter Shimon's house, and not to drink even a drop of cold drink (from Shimon), he may enter the house and drink cold drink. He intended to forbid only eating and drinking. (Even eating and drinking is permitted, for he did not say that he forbids it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He said that even a drop of cold drink is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, (in such cases) people do not mean exactly what they say;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Also the buyer and seller do not mean exactly what they say! (All the more so, for they are not as precise as Reuven was, and there is less discrepancy between their words and their intent!)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Ravina):</span> That case is different!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tzadikim make small offers and do much. (If Reuven would agree to drink a drop, Shimon would serve him a full meal.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Here, we have a doubt. Perhaps each really intends to compromise on the price, and the vows are of persuasion;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or, perhaps each is adamant not to budge, and the vows are real vows!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PERMITTING THE FOUR VOWS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Yehudah citing Rav):</span> One who took one of the four vows must ask a Chacham for permission.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah says that Chachamim permitted them. You cannot say that one must ask a Chacham!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rav Yosef (Rav Yehudah citing Rav Asi):</span> A Chacham can permit a vow only if it is like one of the four vows.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that a vow cannot be permitted through (mere) regret. (Rather, one must show why the vow was a mistake from the beginning.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A man who had vowed came to Rav Huna to permit the vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Huna - Do you still desire the vow?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The man - No.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rav Huna permitted the vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A man who had vowed came to Rabah bar Rav Huna to permit the vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rabah bar Rav Huna - If 10 people had appeased you at the time of the vow, would you have vowed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The man - No.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rabah bar Rav Huna permitted the vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If one seeks permission of a vow, we ask if he still desires the vow. If he says 'no', we permit it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi says, in the name of his father, we ask him 'if 10 people had appeased you at the time of the vow, would you have vowed?'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he says no, we permit the vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A man came to R. Asi to permit a vow. (Ran - this is not Rav Asi. The Mordechai (Shevuos 759) holds that it was Rav Asi.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Asi - Do you regret the vow from the beginning?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The man (incredulously) - No?! (Of course I do!)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Asi permitted the vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>A man came before R. Elazar to permit a vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Elazar - Are you still happy with the vow?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The man - Had they not angered me, I never would have vowed (and I regret that I did).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Elazar - It should be like you want (the vow is permitted).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>A woman had vowed that her daughter should not benefit from her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan - Had you known that neighbors will say that surely you vowed because you saw immorality in her, would you have vowed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The woman - No.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yochanan permitted the vow.</p>
