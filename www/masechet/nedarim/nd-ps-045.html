<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> In Beraisa #2, he made it Hefker in front of three people. R. Yosi considers this to be proper Hefker (and he cannot retract). In Beraisa #1, Hefker was done in front of two (or less). This is not Hefker mid'Oraisa (he can retract until someone takes it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Hefker in front of three is Hefker. In front of two it is not Hefker.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Mid'Oraisa, even in front of one person it is Hefker;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim said that it should be done in front of three, in order that one of them could acquire it and the other two could testify to this.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov permits them, since each enters his own portion.</p>
