<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A KOHEN'S WIFE THAT WAS DEFILED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> The Mishnah (Rishonah, i.e. the original law) says that a woman who says that she was defiled receives a Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Her husband is a Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If she willingly committed adultery, clearly she forfeits her Kesuvah! 	If she says that she was raped, she is permitted to her husband!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rather, her husband is a Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If she willingly committed adultery, she forfeits her Kesuvah just like a Yisrael's wife!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Rather, she says that she was raped, and she receives her Kesuvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a woman says to her husband (in front of Beis Din) 'you divorced me', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Hamnuna - Mishnah):</span> If she says 'I was defiled' (she is believed);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even the Mishnah Acharonah says that she is not believed only because her husband does not know, so she is brazen to lie about this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Her husband knows whether or not he divorced her. There is a Chazakah that a wife is not so brazen to lie in front of her husband like this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Just the contrary! Even the Mishnah Rishonah believes her only because she would not lie to disgrace herself (that she was defiled);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who is angry at her husband may have the audacity to say 'you divorced me.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mesharshiya):</span> Mishnah Rishonah believes her when she says 'Shamayim is between us', even though this is no disgrace to herself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> She needs to explain that she means that his semen does not shoot out. This is an awesome disgrace to him. She is not so brazen to lie about such a matter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah Acharonah):</span> If she says 'Shamayim is between me and you' she is not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She knows that her husband knows the truth. It takes great audacity to lie about this, yet she is not believed. This refutes Rav Hamnuna!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Hamnuna):</span> The husband knows that he has Bi'ah, but does not know whether or not his semen shoots out, so she is able to lie about this.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>APPARENT ADULTERY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>There was a woman that used to bring water for her husband to wash the morning after they would have Bi'ah. One morning she brought for him, and he remarked that they did not have Bi'ah the previous night.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">His wife:</span> If so, I must have had Bi'ah with one of the Nochri spice peddlers (her husband was a Kohen; this would forbid her to him, even though she was Shogeg).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">91b----------------------------------------91b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> She wants to make her husband divorce her, because she desires to marry someone else. We give no credence to her words.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Once, a certain woman was not jovial with her husband as usual.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The husband:</span> What changed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The wife:</span> Until now, you never hurt me during Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">The husband:</span> We did not have Bi'ah now!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">The wife:</span> If so, I must have had Bi'ah with one of the Nochri kerosene peddlers.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman (to the husband):</span> Don't be concerned for her words. She wants to make you divorce her, because she desires to marry someone else.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A man was with a married woman in her house; the house was locked. The husband came home; the man broke through the fence and fled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> She is permitted to her husband. Had the man had Bi'ah with her, he would have hid himself, from fear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>An adulterer entered a woman's house. Her husband came, and the adulterer hid in the doorway. The husband was about to eat some cress from which a snake had eaten; his wife did not see that he was about to eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The adulterer warned the husband 'don't eat from the cress, for a snake ate from it.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> She is permitted to her husband. Had the man had Bi'ah with her, he would want the husband to die - "They had adultery, and blood was in their hands."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he had Bi'ah with her, and he wanted the husband to live, in order that the wife should be forbidden - "Stolen waters are sweeter, (stolen) bread eaten in hiding is tastier." Rava teaches that this is not so. (The adulterer does not know that stolen waters are sweeter.)</p>
