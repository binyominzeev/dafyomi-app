<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ANNULMENT BEFORE A VOW TAKES EFFECT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Only Rav Acha bar Rav Huna is wise enough to do such a thing!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Acha holds that Chachamim and R. Nasan argue both regarding annulment (of a husband) and permission (of a Chacham, through regret of the one who vowed. Therefore, he had to make the vow take effect before it could be permitted).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papi):</span> They argue only about annulment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Nasan's opinion is hinted at by "v'Chafrah (will be ashamed, the worshippers of) the moon" - by substitution of a letter, this may be read v'Hafrah (will annul. This may be done only after the person has done something akin to building a (forbidden) private Mizbe'ach, i.e. his vow took effect);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim learn from "(Hash-m) annuls the thoughts of the crafty" - annulment may be done before the vow takes effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>All agree that a Chacham cannot permit a vow before it takes effect - "he will not profane his word (he will do like he said." This is after it took effect, and he will not profane his word, but others may.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support #1 (for Rav Papi - Beraisa #1):</span> If one said 'I am forbidden to benefit from Ploni; also, from a Chacham who will permit that vow', a Chacham may permit the first vow, and then the second.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Chacham could permit a vow before it takes effect, he could permit either vow first!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is no support. Perhaps 'the first vow' refers to the first one he permits, but it may be either vow!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support #2 (Beraisa #2):</span> If one said 'I will not benefit from Ploni; I am a Nazir when I have a Chacham permit my vow', a Chacham may permit the vow, and then the Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Chacham could permit a vow before it takes effect, he could permit either vow first!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the Beraisa is like R. Nasan, but Chachamim argue.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina citing Rav Papi):</span> They argue only about annulment, but all agree that a Chacham can permit a vow before it takes effect - "He will not profane his word." (Others may profane it, even though it is a mere word, i.e. it did not yet take effect.)</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A WIFE WHO CLAIMS TO BE FORBIDDEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> At first, if a woman said any of the following three things to her husband, Beis Din would force him to divorce her and pay her Kesuvah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I was defiled, so I am forbidden to you;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shamayim is (a judge) between me and you (that you cannot have children);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>I forbid myself to have Bi'ah with any Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The law was revised, lest women use these claims in order to marry someone else.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she says 'I was defiled', she is not believed without proof;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she says 'Shamayim is between me and you', we use the method of request (he should try to appease her);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If she says 'I forbid myself to have Bi'ah with any Yisrael', her husband annuls the part of the vow relevant to himself, and she is forbidden to all other men.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> If she says 'I was defiled', may she eat Terumah (according to Mishnah Acharonah, i.e. the revised law)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> Yes, lest people think that she was defiled and say that her children are Chalalim (disqualified from Kehunah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> No, she can eat Chulin. (People will not suspect her children. They will think she does not have Terumah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rav Sheshes agrees that she may not eat if she was widowed (Tosfos - or divorced);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since she ate during the marriage, people will assume that she was defiled afterwards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If a Kohen's wife was raped, does she receive her Kesuvah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since a Kohen's wife being raped is like a Yisrael's wife having adultery willingly, she does not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, can she say that she is fitting to remain married, and it is her husband's bad fortune (that he is a Kohen and is forbidden to me)?</p>
