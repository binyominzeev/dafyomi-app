<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>GROUNDS FOR PERMISSION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> We can be Pose'ach (suggest that a vow was mistaken, which is grounds to permit it) by suggesting that the vow disgraces his parents;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim forbid this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Tzadok:</span> Rather than suggesting the disgrace to his parents, we should suggest the disgraces to Hash-m!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> If so, there are no vows!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim agree with R. Eliezer when the vow forbids his parents.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Eliezer says, we can permit vows using Nolad (subsequent unexpected developments);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Chachamim forbid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The following cases are Nolad:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven vowed not to benefit from Ploni, and Ploni became the scribe of the town, or Ploni was about to marry off his son (and Reuven wants to attend);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Reuven says, had I known that he would become the scribe, or would marry off his son in the near future, I would not have vowed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One said 'it is forbidden for me to enter this house', and it became a synagogue;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Had he known that it would become a synagogue, he would not have vowed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Eliezer permits such cases, and Chachamim forbid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does it mean '(if so,) there are no vows'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> If so, vows are not permitted properly;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">64b----------------------------------------64b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> If so, people will permit their own vows without going to a Chacham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Chachamim agree with R. Eliezer when the vow forbids his parents.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, according to Abaye, he initially wanted to anger his parents, and now he regrets this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Rava, here also, we should be concerned lest people permit their own vows without going to a Chacham!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since people know that other vows can be permitted only by a Chacham, they will go to a Chacham also for this type of vow.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PERMITTING THROUGH <i>NOLAD</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> We can be Pose'ach using Nolad...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Eliezer's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> (Moshe had sworn to Yisro that he would not leave him, for he feared Dasan and Aviram. Hash-m told Moshe that he can annul his vow,) "for all the men have died..." Death is Nolad!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Chachamim argue?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim say that they did not really die:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Wherever the Torah discusses men Nitzim and Nitzavim (quarreling and standing), it refers to Dasan and Aviram. (It was they who quarreled and informed on Moshe, and they lived until Korach's rebellion!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> (Hash-m said that they died because) they became poor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Anyone without children is considered to be dead. (Rachel said) "Give to me children. If not, I am dead."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Four people are considered like dead: a poor person, a Metzora, a blind person and a childless person.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn about a poor person from "for all the men have died";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We learn about a Metzora from "do not let her (Miryam) be like dead";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We learn about a blind person from "In darkness he sat me, like the dead";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>We learn about a childless person from "Give to me children, If not, I am dead."</p>
