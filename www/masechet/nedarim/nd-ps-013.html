<p class="dedicationbox"><br>12TH CYCLE DEDICATION<br>NEDARIM 12-14 - Two weeks of Dafyomi study material have been dedicated by Ms. Estanne Abraham-Fawer to honor the eighth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>HATFASAH</i> IN A <i>BECHOR</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They discuss a Bechor before Zerikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Yehudah permit?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ki Yidor Neder" - Hatfasah must be in Davar ha'Nadur (something forbidden due to a vow), not in Davar ha'Asur (something that the Torah forbade).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yakov forbids, because he expounds "la'Shem" to include Davar ha'Asur.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yehudah learn from "la'Shem"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This includes Hatfasah in Chatas and Asham. (Even though one was obligated to bring them, he needed to be Makdish them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he include Chatas and Asham, but exclude Bechor? (Perhaps we should say the opposite!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chatas and Asham became Kodesh through a Neder. Bechor is Hekdesh from birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Yakov holds that Hatfasah in Bechor forbids, for also it becomes Kodesh through a Neder:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> When a Bechor if born, it is a Mitzvah to declare it Hekdesh - "ha'Zachar Takdish."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>R. Yehudah permits, for a Bechor becomes Hekdesh even if he was not Makdish it. (Therefore, it is not Davar ha'Nadur.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HATFASAH IN HEKDESH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'like Imra (lambs)' or 'like pens' (this forbids).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one said 'Imra', 'for Imra', or 'like Imra' and finished 'that I will eat from you', he is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The same applies if he began with 'pens', 'wood', '(things that go on the) fires', 'Mizbe'ach', 'Heichal', 'Yerushalayim', or if he prefaced any of these with 'for' or 'like';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he began with any of these and concluded 'that I will not eat from you', he is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is this Tana, who does not distinguish between 'Imra', 'for Imra', or 'like Imra'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If he began with any of these and concluded 'that I will not eat from you', he is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is unlike R. Meir!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If one says "l'Korban (is) what I will not eat of yours," he is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> He means "what I eat from you is like a Korban, therefore I will not eat from you."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When he says "Lo Imra (some texts - l'Chulin"), this means 'not Kodesh', therefore he is permitted (R. Meir does not deduce the positive from the negative.) When he says "l'Imra", this means 'Kodesh', therefore he is forbidden, like R. Aba taught.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said "Korban", "Olah", "Minchah", "Chatas" or "Shelamim", and concluded "that I eat of yours," he is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yehudah permits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If he said "ha'Korban", "like a Korban" or "Korban", and concluded "that I eat of yours", he is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Meir forbids one who said "l'Korban (is) what I will not eat of yours".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> The penultimate clause forbids "ha'Korban", "k'Korban" or "Korban that I eat of yours", he is forbidden. This is like R. Meir (above), who does not distinguish between "Imra" and "l'Imra". (The following question does not depend on the authorship of our Mishnah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> Chachamim (forbid without saying 'like'. They) agree with R. Yehudah that if one said "Ha (this) Korban", "Ha Olah", "Ha Minchah", "Ha Chatas" or "Ha Shelamim", and concluded "that I eat of yours," he is permitted, for he vowed by the life of the Korban (which is meaningless).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All permit when he said "Ha Korban", for he vowed by the life of the Korban. R. Meir is stringent when he said "ha'Korban".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If one said "l'Korban (is) what I will not eat of yours", he is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Meir holds that we do not deduce the positive from the negative!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> He means "what I eat from you is like a Korban, therefore I will not eat from you."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OATHS ABOUT INTANGIBLE MATTERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Levi said to David 'Konam is my mouth from speaking with you, or my hands from working with him, or my feet from walking with you', he is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> There is a stringency of oaths over vows, and a stringency of vows over oaths:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The stringency of Nedarim is that they can take effect on a Mitzvah, just like on Reshus (something optional). This does not apply to Shevuos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The stringency of Shevuos is that they can take effect on tangible and intangible matters, but Nedarim do not (they apply only to tangible matters. Talking, working, and walking are intangible!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> In the Mishnah he forbade his mouth to speak (with Levi), his hands to work with him, and his legs to walk with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> 'Konam is my mouth...'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He did not say 'that I will speak...'</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK V'ELU MUTARIN</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>NEDARIM</i> THAT ARE PERMITTED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following Nedarim are permitted:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He said "Chulin (is) what I will eat of yours", or (what I will eat) is like pork, idolatry, hides pierced to allow removal of the heart (for idolatry), Neveilos, Tereifos, vermin, insects, or the Chalah of Aharon and his Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one told his wife "you are forbidden to me like my mother," we permit it through a different Pesach (than his mother's honor), so he will not take the matter lightly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> He is permitted because he said "Chulin (is) what I will eat of yours." Had he said "l'Chulin" it would mean that it is not Chulin, rather Korban (and he is forbidden).</p>
