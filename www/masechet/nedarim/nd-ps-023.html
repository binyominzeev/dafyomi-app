<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WAYS OF PERMITTING VOWS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Bitnis, son of Aba Sha'ul ben Bitnis:</span> Did you vow, intending that this would pain Chachamim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon b'Rebbi said that he had not; Bitnis permitted the vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yishmael bar R. Yosi came before Chachamim to permit a vow. They suggested things that he might have overlooked when he vowed. Each time, he said that he vowed with that in mind.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A launderer saw that this was paining Chachamim. He hit R. Yishmael bar R. Yosi with his rack.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael bar R. Yosi:</span> I did not vow with intent to be hit by a launderer!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yishmael permitted his own vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> This is Nolad (an unexpected development). He did not expect to be hit. We hold that we do not permit vows using Nolad!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> This is not Nolad. There are many wanton people who pain Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Abaye suggested that his wife's daughter marry one of his relatives. His wife suggested that she marry one of her relatives.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> If you marry her off to your relative, you may not get any benefit from me.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She married her off to her relative; Abaye came before Rav Yosef to permit his vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Had you known that she would defy you, would you have vowed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> No.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Rav Yosef permitted the vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this really grounds for permitting a vow?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A man vowed that his wife will not go up to Yerushalayim for the festival (if she disobeys, she may not benefit from him). She went up;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi asked if he would have vowed had he known that she would go up. The man said that he would not have vowed; R. Yosi permitted the vow.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PERMITTING VOWS IN ADVANCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, even one who wants to vow to pressure his friend to eat by him, should say 'any vow that I will take should be void.' He must remember at the time of the vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Since he says this, his friend will know that the vow is void and will not comply!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">23b----------------------------------------23b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated; it means as follows.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven wants that Shimon should eat by him, but Shimon refuses. If Reuven vows to persuade Shimon, these are vows of persuasion;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one wants any vows he takes the entire year to be void, he should say on Rosh Hashanah 'any vow that I will take should be void.' He must remember at the time of the vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he remembers at the time of the vow, he uproots his stipulation and takes a valid vow!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> We must amend the Mishnah to say 'provided he does not remember at the time of the vow.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The text of the Mishnah is correct. The case is, he stipulated on Rosh Hashanah, and forgot what he stipulated.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he remembers (that he made some stipulation, but does not remember it) at the time of his vow, and vows according to his stipulation, the vow is void;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he does not say that he vows according to his stipulation, he uproots his stipulation and the vow is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rav Huna bar Chinena intended to expound this at the lesson.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> The Tana concealed this, so people will not take vows lightly, and you want to teach this at the lesson?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Do Chachamim disagree with R. Eliezer ben Yakov?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If they argue, like whom is the Halachah?</p>
