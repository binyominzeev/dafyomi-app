<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DAVAR SHE'YESH LO MATIRIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> There is no Shi'ur (that can be Batel in a mixture) for any Davar she'Yesh Lo Matirin (there is a time, place or way in which the Isur is permitted), such as Tevel, Ma'aser Sheni, Hekdesh, and Chadash (new grain before the Omer is offered);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>For every Davar she'Ein Lo Matirin, such as Terumah, Terumas Ma'aser, Chalah, Orlah, and Kil'ei ha'Kerem, Chachamim fixed a Shi'ur (how much Heter is needed for Bitul).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Shemitah is never permitted, yet it is never Batel!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any amount of Shemitah produce forbids b'Minah (if it became mixed with Heter with the same species, or if sixth year produce grew additionally in Shemitah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Rosh) R. Shimon:</span> (In that Mishnah) I said only regarding Bi'ur (if a bulb of Shishis grew in Shemitah, the growth is not Batel and the onion must be eradicated);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding eating (if Peros Shemitah were mixed with Heter), if they do not give taste to the mixture, they are Batel (since Ein Lo Matirin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ran's text) R. Shimon:</span> That Mishnah applies only to (before) Bi'ur (Shemitah produce is permitted before Bi'ur, so it is Yesh Lo Matirin and it is not Batel);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding eating (a mixture after Bi'ur), if the Shemitah produce does not give taste to the mixture, it is Batel (since Ein Lo Matirin). (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps here also we are stringent to say that the bulb is not Batel!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IS A BULB <i>BATEL</i> IN ADDITIONAL GROWTH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Mishnah):</span> If onions were in the ground in Shemitah and rain fell and they sprouted:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the leaves are black, they are forbidden. If they are green, they are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Chanina ben Antigonus says, if they can be uprooted by the leaves, they are forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Regarding Shemitah onions which resumed growing in Sheminis, if the leaves grew this amount [the new growth is the majority], the onions are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A forbidden bulb is Batel in permitted growth!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the Mishnah discusses onions that were mashed (they are unimportant, therefore they are Batel in the added growth).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">58b----------------------------------------58b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Beraisa):</span> One who weeds with a Nochri in Chasayos (this will be explained) may eat from them (before tithing) Arai (haphazardly). One tithes them like Vadai Tevel (before eating Kavu'a);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, (if he was weeding) in Sheminis he may eat Chasayos of a Yisrael suspected of transgressing Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The added growth in the eighth year nullifies the bulb (of Shemitah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is no proof. Perhaps R. Shimon permits species in which the seed disintegrates!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> Chasayos are species like lupines, garlic, and onions (in which the seed remains).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is no proof. Perhaps the case is, the produce was ground up (Ran - before it was planted; Rosh - after it was harvested, and it was mixed with Heter)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Beraisa discusses one suspected of transgressing Shemitah. He would not bother to grind up the produce!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is no proof. Perhaps the produce was mixed up with Heter!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Beraisa allows one to eat while weeding, when it is not mixed up!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This Beraisa refutes R. Yochanan and R. Yonasan (57b).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Yitzchak):</span> Shemitah is different. Since the Isur comes through land, the Isur can be Batel even while attached to the land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Isur of Ma'aser comes through land, but it is not Batel while attached!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Terumas Ma'aser was not separated from a Litra of Ma'aser Rishon, and it was planted, and it is now 10 Litras, Ma'aser and Shemitah apply to the produce;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Tithes on the initial Litra must be separated from other produce.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The obligation to tithe does not come from the land, rather from Miru'ach (final processing).</p>
