<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A PARTIALLY PERMITTED VOW (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina against Rava - Beraisa - R. Nasan):</span> A vow can be partially permitted and partially forbidden. The case is, he vowed not to eat from a basket containing Benos Shu'ach (a species of fig);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(When he found out,) he said 'had I known that Benos Shu'ach were inside, I would not have vowed.' The rest of the basket is forbidden, and the Benos Shu'ach are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Later, R. Akiva taught that a vow that is partially permitted is entirely permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He said 'had I known that Benos Shu'ach were inside, I would have said 'black and white figs are forbidden, and Benos Shu'ach are permitted.'' This is R. Akiva's opinion, and Chachamim argue!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. He said 'had I known that Benos Shu'ach were inside, I would have said 'the (entire) basket is forbidden, (but) the Benos Shu'ach are permitted.''</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the following Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Reuven took one vow not to benefit from five people. If one of them became permitted, all five are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said '(had I known, I would have said) 'all are forbidden except for Ploni'', Ploni is permitted, and the others are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> According to Rabah, the Reisha is like R. Akiva, and all agree to the Seifa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rava, the Seifa is like Chachamim, and all agree to the Reisha.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE EXEMPTION OF <i>ONES</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are vows of Ones. Shimon made Reuven vow that he will eat by him. Reuven (was unable to because he) or his son fell ill, or he could not cross the river. These are vows of Ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Huna):</span> Reuven was holding documents in his favor in Beis Din. He said 'if I do not return within 30 days, these proofs should be void.' An Ones prevented him from returning in time. His proofs are void.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> The Torah exempts one when there is an Ones. "You will not do anything to the girl (who was raped during Eirusin)"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this applies only to capital punishment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> The following are vows of Ones. Shimon made Reuven vow that he will eat by him. Reuven or his son fell ill, or he could not cross the river.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question #1:</span> According to Rabah, why is this different than the following?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man said 'this Get divorces you now, if I do not come within 12 months' and he died within this time, the Get worked.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to Rabah, since Ones prevented him from returning, the Get should be invalid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps that case is different. Had he known that he would die, he would have divorced her immediately (unconditionally).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">27b----------------------------------------27b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question #2:</span> According to Rabah, why is Rav Huna's case different than the following?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A man told witnesses 'if I do not come within 30 days, this Get should be valid.' On day 30 he was unable to get the ferry to cross the river. He screamed 'see, I am coming'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> This is not considered coming.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>According to Rabah, the Get should not work, due to the Ones!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps the Halachah is different regarding a common Ones.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ASMACHTA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Rav Huna rule that the man's proofs are void? This was Asmachta (an exaggeration) which is not binding!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This case was different for he was holding his proofs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Holding them does not prevent it from being Asmachta!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> Reuven paid part of his debt. The document was given to a third party. Reuven said 'If I do not pay the rest within 30 days return the document to the lender (and he can collect the full loan).' He did not pay up in time. We give the document to the lender;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, we do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Yosi, who says that Asmachta is binding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This case is different. Since he said that the proofs should be void, this is like an admission that they are invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The Halachah is, Asmachta is binding when there is no Ones, and when the stipulation was made in a respected Beis Din.</p>
