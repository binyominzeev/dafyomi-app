<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A VOW OF <i>CHEREM</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Matters of the returning exiles include the Temple mount, the courtyards, and wells in the middle of the road;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Matters of the city include the street, the bathhouse, the Beis ha'Keneses, the Aron, and Sifrei Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, if one wrote that his share in these things should belong to the Nasi (the leader), this is like giving his share to a commoner;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The only difference is, when one writes his share to the Nasi, no Kinyan (acquisition) is needed. If he writes to a commoner, a Kinyan is needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim say, in either case a Kinyan is needed. The Nasi was mentioned only because it was common to write one's share to the Nasi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yehudah says, inhabitants of Galil need not write their shares (to permit people who vowed not to benefit), for their ancestors already gave their shares (to the Nasi).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why is the Mudar forbidden when the Noder wrote his share in these things to the Nasi?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Sheshes):</span> The Mishnah means, the solution for people who vowed from each other is to write their shares to the Nasi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> Inhabitants of Galil not need write their shares, for their ancestors already wrote their shares.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Inhabitants of Galil were quarrelsome, and often vowed not to benefit from each other. Therefore, their ancestors already gave their shares to the Nasi.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WAYS OF EVADING A VOW</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was Mudar Hana'ah from Shimon, and Reuven has nothing to eat, Shimon may give a gift to Levi, and Reuven may eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A case occurred in Beis Choron in which Yakov was Mudar Hana'ah from his son Reuven. Reuven was marrying off his son. He told a friend David 'the courtyard and the banquet are yours, only in order that my father can eat with us.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> If they are mine, I say that they are Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> I did not give them to you to make them Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> You gave them to me in order that you and your father will eat together, and I will bear the sin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> If the recipient of a gift cannot make it Hekdesh, it is not a gift.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The case brought does not support the law taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated. It means, if it later becomes evident that the gift was insincere, it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Such a case occurred in Beis Choron.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rava):</span> This applies only when he said 'they are yours only in order that father will come';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But if he said 'they are yours, so father will come', he means 'if you want' (and this is permitted, for the gift was unconditional).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rava):</span> Do not think that this is only when he said 'they are not yours (except for father to come)'; but if he said 'they are yours so father will come', this is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, even in the latter case it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The banquet proves what his intention is. (It was not an unconditional gift.)</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A <i>KINYAN</i> FOR THE FUTURE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Shimon's son used to steal flax. Shimon forbade his property to his son.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Shimon's friends:</span> What if a son of your son will be a Chacham?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> My son should acquire the property on condition to give it to his son if his son will be a Chacham. (If my son's son will not be a Chacham, my son should not acquire.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does this work?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chachamim of Pumbedisa):</span> No. One cannot acquire on condition to give to someone else.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> It works. One who does Chalipin (a Kinyan made through giving a garment) takes the garment only in order to give something else!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> Perhaps the one who takes the garment can keep it (and Rav Nachman has no proof)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> One who does Chalipin takes the garment in order to give now to someone else;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the above case, Shimon's son acquires only when his son will be a Chacham. By then the garment (used for Chalipin) has already been returned (I.e. the Kinyan lapsed.)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava, against Rav Nachman):</span> The case of the gift of Beis Choron was a Kinyan on condition to give to someone else, and it did not work!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> There, the banquet proves that the gift was insincere.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Eliezer, who forbids even Vitur (small benefits) to one who is Mudar Hana'ah. (Just like he is stringent about Mudar Hana'ah, he is stringent here.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> Any gift that the recipient cannot make Hekdesh is not a gift.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which case is included by the word 'any'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It includes this case (the gift for the sake of the grandson; the Kinyan is invalid)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it includes the expression in Version #2 of Rava (48a. Even if he said 'they are yours in order that father will come', this is forbidden.)</p>
