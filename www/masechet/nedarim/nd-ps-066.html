<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WAYS TO BE <i>POSE'ACH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may be Pose'ach by pointing out that a vow includes Shabbos and Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>At first, Chacham thought that only Shabbos and Yom Tov are permitted (after regret). R. Akiva taught that a vow that was partially permitted is totally permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Levi said 'Konam, none of you may benefit from me' and one of the people became permitted (to benefit from Levi), all of them are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he said 'may not benefit from me - not this one, nor this...', and the first person named becomes permitted, all are permitted. If the last one becomes permitted, the others remain forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If one said 'benefit that I give to this person should be like a Korban, (benefit) to this one, like a Korban...', to annul them, a separate Pesach (reason to consider the vow a mistake) is needed for each one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If one said 'wine is forbidden to me, for it harms the intestines', and then he heard that old wine is good for the intestines, all wine is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'onions are forbidden to me, for they harm the heart', and then he heard that onions of Kufri are good for the heart, all onions are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Such a case occurred, and R. Meir permitted all onions to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The Mishnah says 'if the first becomes permitted, all are permitted. If the last becomes permitted, the others remain forbidden... [benefit that I give to this person should be like a Korban, to this one, like a Korban...]' Whom is the Tana?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It is R. Shimon, who says that if one forbade several people through an oath, it is considered one oath unless he mentions the word 'oath' for each one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> 'Wine is forbidden to me...'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Why must we say that old wine is good for the intestines?) Even if it was neither good nor bad, the vow is permitted! (He said that he forbids wine because it is harmful!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> This is true. The Mishnah teaches more than necessary. He is permitted because old wine is not bad for the intestines. In fact, it is good for them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> 'Onions are forbidden to me, for they harm...'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Why must we say that onions of Kufri are good for the heart?) It suffices that they are not bad!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> The Mishnah teaches that not only they are not bad. In fact, they are good!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may be Pose'ach by suggesting that a person should be concerned for his own honor and that of his children.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We say 'had you known that people will say that it is your way is to divorce women, that your daughters were born (out of wedlock) after the divorce of their mother, that you must have seen reason to divorce her (infidelity)', would you have vowed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he says 'had I thought of this, I would not have vowed', it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>If one said 'I will not marry Plonis, because she is ugly', and she is actually pretty, or 'because she is black (or short)', and she is really white (or tall); he is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not because she was ugly or black or short, and she became pretty or white or tall. Rather, the vow was a mistake from the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A case occurred in which Reuven vowed not to marry his sister's daughter. They took her to R. Yishmael's house and prettied her up.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> Did you vow from this girl?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> No!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yishmael permitted the vow. He cried 'Benos Yisrael are pretty. Poverty dampers their looks!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>When R. Yishmael died, Benos Yisrael lamented. They lamented similarly when Sha'ul died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The case brought contradicts the law of the Mishnah (that if she was ugly and became pretty, the vow is not permitted)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated. It means as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yishmael says, even if an ugly girl became pretty, or a black or short girl became white o r tall, the vow is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A case occurred in which Reuven vowed not to marry his sister's daughter. They took her to R. Yishmael's house and prettied her up...</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">66b----------------------------------------66b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The girl had lost a tooth, and had inserted a tooth in its place. R. Yishmael made for her a gold tooth from his own money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>When R. Yishmael died, he was eulogized as follows, "Benos Yisrael, lament R. Yishmael, who clothes you..."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DEMANDING HUSBANDS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Reuven vowed that his wife may not benefit from him until she gets R. Yehudah and R. Shimon to taste her cooking.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah tasted it. He reasoned 'to make Shalom between a man and his wife (a Sotah), the Torah commands that Hash-m's name, written in Kedushah, be erased into water. All the more so, I will help to make Shalom!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon did not taste it. He said '(the man, and) all the children of the widow should die, and I will not budge. (Rosh - Bnei Almanah refers to people who were not trained to act properly, like this man.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Reuven vowed that his wife may not benefit from him until she spits on R. Shimon ben Gamliel. She spat on his garments (and the vow was permitted).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Acha from Difti):</span> Her husband intended for a disgrace!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> Spitting on R. Shimon ben Gamliel's garments is a great disgrace.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Reuven vowed that his wife may not benefit from him until she shows something nice about her to R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi:</span> Perhaps her head is nice?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">People (who recognized her):</span> No, it is round.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>In searching for something nice about her, he learned that her hair is like flax, her eyes are round, her ears are big, her nose is (shriveled and appears) closed, her lips are thick, her neck is thin, her stomach is inflated, her feet are wide like a goose's, and her name is Lichluchis (filthy).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> Her name is nice (appropriate), for she is filthy with Mumim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A man from Bavel came to Eretz Yisrael and married. His wife did not understand his language. Three times she did contrary to his request. This angered him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Her husband:</span> Break these lamps on the head of Bava (the porch, in Aramaic).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She did not know that Bava means porch. She broke them on the head of Bava ben Buta, who was judging a case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Bava ben Buta:</span> Why did you do this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">The wife:</span> My husband told me to.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Bava ben Buta:</span> You did your husband's request. May Hash-m give to you two sons like myself!</p>
