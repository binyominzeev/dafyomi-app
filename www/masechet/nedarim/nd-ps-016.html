<p class="dedicationbox"><br>12TH CYCLE DEDICATION<br>NEDARIM 16-19 - Two weeks of Dafyomi study material have been dedicated by Ms. Estanne Abraham-Fawer to honor the eighth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>OUR <i>MISHNAH</i> IS R. MEIR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like R. Meir. It is unlike R. Yehudah, who does not distinguish "Korban" from "Ha Korban."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If he said "l'Korban, I will not eat from you" it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah #1 - R. Meir):</span> If one said "l'Korban (is) what I will not eat of yours", he is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> He means "what I eat from you is like a Korban, therefore I will not eat from you."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In Mishnah #1 he said "l'Korban". In our Mishnah he said "l'Korban", i.e. Lo Korban, it is not like a Korban. (R. Meir does not infer the positive from the negative.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>EXPLAINING THE <i>MISHNAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said "Shevu'ah, I will not eat of yours," "Ha Shevu'ah she'Ochel of yours," or "Not a Shevu'ah, that I will not eat of yours," he is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> "Ha Shevu'ah she'Ochel" means that he will not eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah #2):</span> There are two Shevuos (of Bituy explicit in the Torah for which one who transgresses brings a Korban. In all, there are four: she'Ochel, that I will not eat, that I ate, and that I did not eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that "she'Ochel" means that he will eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> It can mean either, depending on the circumstances;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was being pressured to eat, and he said "I will eat, I will eat, and Shevu'ah she'Ochel", he means that he will eat;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he said "I won't eat, I won't eat, and Shevu'ah she'Ochel", he means that he will not eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The Mishnah should say that he said "Ha Shevu'ah she'Iy Ochel (I will not eat)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, obviously he may not eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he wanted to say she'Ochel, and he mispronounced it she'Iy Ochel. (Normally, people say she'Lo Ochel, and not she'Iy Ochel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Abaye did not answer like Rav Ashi, because the Mishnah did not say "she'Iy Ochel".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav Ashi did not answer like Abaye because "that I will not eat" can also mean two things (and the Mishnah should have explained this also);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was being pressed to eat, and he said (incredulously) "I won't eat?! I won't eat?!", whether he swore "I will eat" or "I won't eat", he it means that he will eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Shevu'ah that I will not eat" can also mean that he will not eat (when he was not pressured).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rather, the Tana made a firm rule. "I will eat" means he will eat. "I won't eat" means he won't (regardless of the context).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE STRINGENCY OF <i>NEDARIM</i> OVER <i>SHEVUOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> This is (the previous Mishnah) is a stringency of Shevuos over Nedarim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A stringency of Nedarim over Shevuos is that if one said 'Konam Sukah, I will not make one' or similarly regarding Lulav, or Tefilin, he is forbidden. Such a Shevu'ah does not forbid, for one cannot swear to override Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Saying that a Shevu'ah is more stringent implies that such a Neder takes effect, but it is weaker. The Mishnah (15b) totally permits ('Korban, I will not eat from you')!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah refers to oaths not to sleep, speak or walk (15b). Such a Neder takes effect mid'Rabanan (15a, 1:c).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SHEVUOS AGAINST MITZVOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A stringency of Nedarim over Shevuos...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal citing Rav or Shmuel):</span> The source that one cannot swear to transgress a Mitzvah is "Lo Yachel Devaro." One may not profane his own word, but he may for the sake of Hash-m's desires (His word).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Presumably, "Neder la'Shem Lo Yachel" teaches that even if a Neder opposes a Mitzvah, he may not profane it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The same should apply to Shevuos, for it says "Shevu'ah la'Shem Lo Yachel"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> A Neder forbids (objects, e.g.) Hana'ah (pleasure) from a Sukah. There is no obligation on a Sukah (Tosfos; Rosh - it does not look like he uproots the Mitzvah from himself). A Shevu'ah forbids himself to benefit from (text of Tosfos, Ran - sit in) a Sukah. (He may not uproot his obligation to do a Mitzvah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Fulfillment of Mitzvos is not considered Hana'ah! (A vow not to get Hana'ah from a Sukah would not forbid the Mitzvah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> A Neder forbidding sitting in a Sukah takes effect, but a Shevu'ah not to sit in a Sukah does not (like above, (d). Ran - we must say that the Neder forbade the Sukah, regarding sitting in it, Sitting is not tangible!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learn that one cannot swear to transgress a Mitzvah from elsewhere!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps if one swore to transgress a Mitzvah and did not do so, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "To do evil or good" - just like doing good refers to something optional, also doing evil. This excludes one who swore to transgress a Mitzvah and did not do so, for this is not left to his whim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This verse exempts from a Korban (for transgressing Shevu'as Bituy). "Lo Yachel" exempts from a Lav.</p>
