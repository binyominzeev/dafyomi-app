<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A HUSBAND AND FATHER MUST ANNUL TOGETHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The father and husband of a Na'arah (a girl in the first six months of adulthood) Me'orasah (after Kidushin but before Nisu'in) annul her vows;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If only one of them annulled the vow, it is not annulled. We need not say that if one affirmed the vow, it is not annulled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The Seifa merely reiterates what was learned in the beginning!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the Reisha says that either can annul by himself. The Seifa clarifies that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We need not say that if one affirmed the vow...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If only one of them annulled, this does nothing. It need not teach that if one affirmed (the vow stands)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We need to hear the case when one annulled, and the other affirmed, and then he annulled his affirmation;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that he uproots his affirmation. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so, both must annul together. (Ramban - now, they can annul together. Rambam - the vow can never be annulled.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE SOURCE THAT THEY BOTH ANNUL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The father and husband of a Na'arah Me'orasah annul her vows.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "And if she will be to a man, and her vows are on her". (The verse discusses an Arusah, and says that the Arus (her husband) can annul. The word "And" equates the law of the previous Parashah, that a father can annul his daughter's vows.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this verse discusses a Nesu'ah (a fully married woman)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Another verse teaches that - "If she vowed in her husband's house..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps both discuss a Nesu'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why is the second verse needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that a Ba'al (a husband after Nisu'in) cannot annul vows from before (Nisu'in).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">67b----------------------------------------67b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We could learn this from the second verse alone!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> The expression "will be (to a man)" connotes Kidushin, not Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the father can annul by himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, why did the Torah need to say "if she vows in her father's house, her father can annul"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the father can annul (by himself) even when she is Arusah, all the more so when she is single!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps an Arusah's father cannot annul alone, but the Arus can.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If this were true, why did the Torah mention the father at all? (It depends only on the Arus!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It would teach that if the father affirmed the vow, the Arus cannot annul it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, why did the Torah write "If she vowed in her husband's house"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If an Arus can annul by himself, all the more so a Ba'al can!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the latter verse teaches that a Ba'al cannot annul vows from before Nisu'in!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From this itself (that a Ba'al cannot annul prior vows) we can deduce (that an Arus cannot annul by himself).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can an Arus annul prior vows, but a Ba'al cannot?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> An Arus annuls together with the father (regarding the father, no vow is 'prior').</p>
