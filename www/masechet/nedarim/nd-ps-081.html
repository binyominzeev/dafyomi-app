<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHICH CHILDREN ARE LIKELY TO BECOME <i>CHACHAMIM</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi holds that not laundering is worse than not bathing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Dirt that accumulates on an uncombed head leads to blindness. Dirt that accumulates on unwashed clothing leads to insanity. Dirt that accumulates when one does not bathe leads to boils.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Sages of Eretz Yisrael):</span> Beware of dirt (the three types mentioned above). Be careful to learn in a group. Be zealous to teach poor children, for they are likely to become great in Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Water (i.e. Torah) will drip mi'Dalyo (from its well)." We read this like 'mi'Dalim', from poor people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't Chachamim usually descend from Chachamim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> It is so they will not say that Torah is an inheritance to them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes brei d'Rav Idi):</span> It is so they will not become haughty over the congregation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Mar Zutra):</span> Chachamim are punished that their children are not Chachamim because they put themselves over the congregation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ashi):</span> It is because they call people 'donkeys'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Ravina):</span> It is because they do not bless before learning Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "Who is the Chacham who knows this (why Yisrael were exiled)?" Chachamim and Nevi'im (Bach - and angels) could not explain it, until Hash-m explained it - "Because they abandoned My Torah".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "They did not listen to My voice" is the same as "they did not go in My way"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> "They did not go in My way" means that they did not (appreciate Torah enough to) bless before learning.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>NOT BATHING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Isi bar Yehudah did not come to R. Yosi's Yeshivah for three days. R. Yosi's son Vardimus asked him why.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Isi:</span> It is because I do not understand his reasoning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Vardimus:</span> What don't you understand? Perhaps I can explain it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Isi):</span> R. Yosi taught that laundry of city dwellers overrides the lives of others. Which verse teaches this?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Vardimus) Question:</span> "The outskirts (of the cities of the Leviyim) will be for their animals, their possessions, and all Chayasam" - what does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot mean 'their Chayos (wild animals)'. These are included in "all their animals"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It means 'their Chiyusa' (livelihood).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious! (Surely, the verse teaches something else!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, it refers to laundering, so they should not suffer from the dirt.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>VOWS BETWEEN THEM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> These are not vows of affliction.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Yosi hold that they may be annulled, for they are between them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> These are not vows of affliction, but they are matters between them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps R. Yosi himself does not hold that way. He merely addressed Chachamim according to their opinion:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> I hold that they are not even matters between them. You say they are vows of affliction. You should admit that they are not vows of affliction! (At most, they are matters between them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> They may be annulled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Huna):</span> They may not be annulled;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">81b----------------------------------------81b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since her husband is used to her, no damage will result if she does not bathe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Ada - Beraisa):</span> The husband can annul vows of affliction, whether they affect him or others. He can annul vows not of affliction only what affects him, but not what affects others;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she said 'Peros are forbidden to me', he can annul this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she said 'what I make is forbidden to my father or brother', or 'to your father or brother', or 'I will not put straw in front of your animal, or water in front of your cattle', he cannot annul these.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If she said 'I will not color my eyes, or Efkos (apply mudpacks to my face; some say - comb my hair) or have Bi'ah', he can annul, for these are between them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If she said 'I will not make your bed, or mix your drink, or wash you face, hands and feet', he need not annul these. (She is obligated to do these, so her vow is invalid);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Gamliel says, he must annul (mid'Rabanan), due to (concern lest she become habituated to vowing, and come to transgress) "he will not revoke his word."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Also, "he will not revoke his word" teaches that a Chacham cannot permit his own vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of support):</span> R. Yosi is the Tana who says that 'I will not color my eyes or Efkos' is a vow between them, and the Beraisa says that he can annul it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If she said 'I will not have Bi'ah', he can annul it, for this is between them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the exact text of the vow?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she said 'you may not enjoy Bi'ah with me', since she is obligated to have Bi'ah with him, the vow is void. Why must he annul it?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, she said 'pleasure of Bi'ah with you is forbidden to me.' This is like Rav Kahana taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> If she said 'pleasure of Bi'ah with me is forbidden to you', he can force her to have Bi'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she said 'pleasure of Bi'ah with you is forbidden to me', he must annul this. (If he does not, he may not have Bi'ah with her, for she is forbidden, and) one may not cause another to transgress.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who taught the following?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "He will not revoke his word" - if people consider something to be forbidden, and really it is permitted, you may not be lenient about it to abolish the custom;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This verse also teaches that a Chacham cannot permit his own vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Gamliel taught this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> According to Chachamim, is a vow not to have Bi'ah a vow of affliction, or a vow between them?</p>
