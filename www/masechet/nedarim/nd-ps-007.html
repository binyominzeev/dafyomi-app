<p class="dedicationbox"><br>12TH CYCLE DEDICATION<br>NEDARIM 7-10 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the eighth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>YADOS FOR TZEDAKAH AND HEFKER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do Yados work for Tzedakah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he said "this coin is for Tzedakah, and this one, too", that is Tzedakah itself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he said only "and this", without saying "too";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Does he mean "and this one is also for Tzedakah", or "and this one is for expenditures"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>In the Parashah of Korbanos it says "b'Ficha", to teach about Tzedakah. We ask whether the Hekesh teaches that Yados work also for Tzedakah, or if it teaches only about Bal Te'acher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do Yados work for Hefker?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, this is like Tzedakah! (People make Hefker so the poor will take!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We ask, if you will say that Yados work for Tzedakah because a Hekesh equates the matters in every respect, is Hefker just like Tzedakah?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or, is Hefker different, for it is even for rich people?</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>YADOS FOR BEIS HA'KISEI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Do Yados work for Beis ha'Kisei (a privy, to forbid Kri'as Shema there)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he said "this enclosure will be a Beis ha'Kisei, and this one, too", surely also the latter is a Beis ha'Kisei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he said only "and this one" without saying "too";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Does he mean that it also will be a Beis ha'Kisei, or that it will be it for other uses?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ravina's question assumes that designation for a Beis ha'Kisei takes effect. Elsewhere, Ravina asked whether designation for a Beis ha'Kisei or bathhouse takes effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He asked whether designation takes effect, and if it does, whether or not Yados work.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>These questions are not resolved. (Some say that Yad works for Tzedakah, for the Gemara said 'if you will say...')</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE ARGUMENT OF R. AKIVA AND CHACHAMIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Akiva was inclined to be stringent about one who said 'I am Menudeh to you.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> R. Akiva agrees that he is not lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If he said "Nedina (I am distanced from benefit) from you", all agree that he is forbidden. (He said "Nedina that I will eat from you", and he is lashed if he transgresses.) If he said "Meshamtana from you", all agree that he is permitted. (This connotes excommunication, not a Neder.) They argue about "Menudeh";</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva holds that this is like Nedina. Chachamim hold that it is like Meshamtana.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav Papa argues with R. Chisda.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A case occurred in which a man said "Meshamtana from the property of R. Yirmiyah's son." Rav Chisda said "no one is concerned for R. Akiva's opinion."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Chisda holds that they argue about Meshamtana.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>RULES OF EXCOMMUNICATION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ila):</span> If Levi was present when he was excommunicated, it can be permitted only in his presence (lest he suspect that others who do not abide by it are transgressing).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was not present, it can be permitted whether or not he is present.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chanin):</span> If David hears Reuven say Hash-m's Name in vain, he must excommunicate Reuven. If he does not, David should be excommunicated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This is because poverty frequents places where Hash-m's Name is taken in vain, and poverty is like death;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m told Moshe "all the men (who sought to kill you, i.e. Dasan and Aviram) have died." (They were still alive, but Hash-m said that they died because they became poor.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Whenever Chachamim saw something worthy of punishment, death or poverty resulted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> A woman said Hash-m's Name in vain in front of Rav Huna. He excommunicated her, and instantly released her, in her presence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>We learn three things from this:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one hears someone say Hash-m's Name in vain, he must excommunicate him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one was present when he was excommunicated, it can be permitted only in his presence.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One may be permitted immediately after he was excommunicated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal):</span> A Chacham can excommunicate himself and permit himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he cannot, for a prisoner cannot release himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a case like Mar Zutra. If a Talmid needed to be excommunicated, he would excommunicate himself first. When he got home, he would permit himself, and then permit the Talmid. (Ran - the Rashba says that he can permit himself only in such a case, when he did not deserve to be excommunicated. Presumably, his text did not say above 'this is obvious!')</p>
