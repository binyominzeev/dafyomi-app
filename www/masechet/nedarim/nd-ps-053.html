<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>BY-PRODUCTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one vowed from dates, he may eat date honey. If one vowed from Stavaniyos (bad grapes that do not ripen), he may have vinegar made from such grapes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah ben Beseira says, if one vowed from a food he may not have any derivative called by the name of that food;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim permit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What do Chachamim and the first Tana argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about R. Shimon ben Elazar's distinction:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> If one vowed from any food that is normal to eat it, and it is normal to eat a derivative of it, such as dates and date honey, (even) its derivative is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If one vowed from the derivative, (also) the food is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one vowed from a food that is not normally eaten, and it is normal to eat a derivative of it (e.g. vinegar made from bad grapes), only the derivative is forbidden, for this was his intention. (Ran - the first Tana always forbids the food and permits the derivative. R. Shimon ben Elazar forbids the food and/or the derivative, whichever is normally eaten. R. Yehudah ben Beseira agrees, but he also forbids the food even if it is not normally eaten. The latter Chachamim in the Mishnah hold like R. Shimon ben Elazar, and permit the food in a case when it is not normally eaten.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ACCOMPANYING NAMES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one vowed from wine, he may drink apple wine. If one vowed from oil, honey or vinegar, he may have sesame (seed) oil, date honey and vinegar of bad grapes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one vowed from leeks, he may eat he may eat Kaplutos (large leeks). If one vowed from Yerakos (vegetables in which we eat the plant itself, not just the seeds) he may eat Yerakos of the field;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All these are permitted because they have accompanying names (they are not called Stam wine, oil...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> In Eretz Yisrael, if one vowed from oil, sesame oil is permitted but olive oil is not. In Bavel, it is vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In a place where both are used, both are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not obvious in a place where one of them is used more.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that we go after the majority usage. The Beraisa teaches that we do not. Since it is a Safek Isur, we are stringent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If one vowed from Yerek in a non-Shemitah year, garden Yerakos are forbidden, and Yerakos of the field are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(If he vowed) in Shemitah, Yerakos of the field are forbidden, and garden Yerakos are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">53b----------------------------------------53b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> This is only in a place where Yerakos are not brought from Chutz la'Aretz (in Shemitah). In a place where Yerakos are imported, (Ran - also; Tosfos - only) garden Yerakos are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tana'im argue about whether or not one may import Yerakos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may not import Yerakos from Chutz la'Aretz;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Chananyah ben Gamliel permits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah):</span> The first Tana forbids, lest a clod of soil will be brought in with the Yerakos (soil of Chutz la'Aretz is Tamei).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SUBCATEGORIES OF FOOD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one vowed from cabbage, he may not eat Aspargus (a type of cabbage). If one vowed from Aspargus, he may eat (other types of) cabbage;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Yehudah says, if he said 'Gris or wheat is forbidden to me', he may eat them raw.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> If one said 'I will not taste wheat', he may not eat baked wheat (i.e. bread), but he may eat raw wheat;</p>
