<p class="dedicationbox"><br>12TH CYCLE DEDICATION<br>NEDARIM 16-19 - Two weeks of Dafyomi study material have been dedicated by Ms. Estanne Abraham-Fawer to honor the eighth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>NEDARIM</i> TAKE EFFECT ON <i>NEDARIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Neder takes effect on another Neder, but a Shevu'ah does not take effect on a Shevu'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one said "I will be a Nazir if I eat, I will be a Nazir if I eat", and he ate, he must conduct one Nezirus for each time he said so;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he said "Shevu'ah, I will not eat this. Shevu'ah, I will not eat this" and he ate it, he is liable only once.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Huna):</span> This is only if he said "I will be a Nazir today (if I eat), I will be a Nazir tomorrow..." Since the latter Nezirus finishes a day later, it takes effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said "I will be a Nazir today, I will be a Nazir today," the latter Nezirus does not take effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Even if he said "I will be a Nazir today, I will be a Nazir today", both take effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Huna, why did the Mishnah distinguish Shevuos from Nedarim? It should have taught that even a Neder takes effect on a Neder only if the latter Nezirus if for another day, but not if it is for the same day!</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>QUESTIONS AGAINST RAV HUNA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> A Neder takes effect on a Neder, but a Shevu'ah does not take effect on a Shevu'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Nedarim are "I will be a Nazir today, I will be a Nazir tomorrow." The corresponding Shevuos are "Shevu'ah I won't eat figs, Shevu'ah I won't eat grapes."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Surely, both Shevuos take effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, the Shevuos were "I won't eat figs, I won't eat figs." The corresponding Nedarim were "I will be a Nazir today, I will be a Nazir today."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Mishnah says that both take effect. This refutes Rav Huna!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question (1)):</span> Really, he said "I will be a Nazir today, I will be a Nazir tomorrow. The corresponding Shevuos were "I won't eat figs, I won't eat figs or grapes (Rosh; Ran - figs and grapes together)." The second oath does not take effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The second oath takes effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If one swore "I won't eat figs. I won't eat figs and grapes", and he ate figs, and was Makdish a Korban for this, and then he ate grapes, the latter transgression is like Chetzi Shi'ur (a partial Isur), for which one does not bring a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(Had he not been Makdish a Korban, he would be liable also for the second oath.) Since the second oath takes effect on grapes, it takes effect also on figs!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Huna disagrees with Rabah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one accepted two terms of Nezirus, observed one, was Makdish a Korban for it, and then permitted his first Nezirus (through regret), what he observed counts for the second.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he said "I will be a Nazir today, I will be a Nazir tomorrow", how can the first count for the second? It does not include the last day!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We must say that he said "I will be a Nazir today. I will be a Nazir today." This shows that both take effect!</p>
