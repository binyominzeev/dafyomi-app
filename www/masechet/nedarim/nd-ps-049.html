<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT IS INCLUDED IN A VOW?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven vowed not to eat Mevushal (anything cooked), he is permitted to eat roasted or half-cooked (Ran; Rosh - overcooked) food;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said 'I will not taste a Tavshil (cooked dish)', he may not eat a soft Tavshil cooked in a pot, but he may eat a thick cooked food, a Tormuta (super-boiled) egg, and Remutzah (a certain kind of) gourds;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one vowed not to eat things made in a pot, only things boiled in a pot are forbidden to him;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he said 'I will not taste anything that entered a pot', he may not eat anything cooked in a pot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Yoshiyah):</span> If one vowed not to eat cooked food, he may not eat roasted food;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A hint for this - "They cooked the Korban Pesach by fire, like its law (it must be roasted)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yoshiyah holds that we interpret vows according to how the Torah uses the words. The Tana of our Mishnah holds that we follow the way people speak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all agree that vows follow the way people speak;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the region of our Tana, 'roasted' and 'cooked' are not interchanged;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In the region of R. Yoshiyah, 'cooked' is also used to refer to roasted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Yoshiyah brought a verse to support himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was a mere Asmachta. (It is not truly expounded from the verse.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>COOKED DISHES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> 'I will not taste a Tavshil...'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He vowed to forbid a Tavshil! (Ran - why are thick dishes permitted? Rosh - why are soft dishes forbidden?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> This Tana calls anything (Rosh; Ran - only something) eaten with bread a cooked dish.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one vowed not to eat a Tavshil, all kinds of Tavshilim are forbidden. He may not have roasted, half-cooked (Rosh - over-cooked) or (properly) cooked food;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He may not have soft small gourds, since sick people eat them with bread.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When R. Yirmiyah was sick, a doctor came to cure him. When the doctor saw a gourd in the house, he left and said that R. Yirmiyah invites his own death!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Soft gourds help a sick person; hard gourds are bad for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava bar Ula):</span> The gourd itself is bad. The inside is good for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The inside of gourds is good to cook with beets. The inside of flax seeds is good to eat with Kutach (a dip made with milk and bread).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One should not say this in front of an ignoramus (Ran - lest they detach flax seeds for this; Rosh - lest they mock us for teaching things that even women know).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> The 'sick people' who eat soft gourds with bread are Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also elsewhere, Rava calls Chachamim 'sick' (because Torah saps their strength).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">49b----------------------------------------49b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We pray for the sick and afflicted. This shows that we hold like R. Yosi (that man is judged every day).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>'Afflicted' cannot mean sick (he also taught sick people)! It must refer to Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He is permitted thick Tavshilim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The Mishnah is not like the Babylonians.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> Babylonians are foolish. They eat bread (i.e. thick porridge) with bread. (Therefore, thick porridge is considered a Tavshil for them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Is there anyone who can ask the experts of Hutzal if wheat porridge should be eaten with wheat bread and barley porridge with barley bread, or if the porridge should not be the same grain as the bread?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Rava would eat his bread with flour of parched grain (Ran; Tosfos - lentils)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>EATING HABITS OF <i>CHACHAMIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rav Huna was eating porridge with his fingers.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rabah bar Rav Huna:</span> Why are you doing this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> Rav said that it is tasty to eat it with a finger. It is even better to eat with two fingers, and even better with three.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav (also Rav Huna) told his son:</span> If you are invited to eat porridge, it is worth travelling up to a Parsah (about four kilometers). For ox meat, travel up to three Parsa'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rav (also Rav Huna) told his son:</span> Do not spit in front of your Rebbi after eating anything, except for gourds and porridge, for saliva after eating these is as harmful as lead.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yosi and R. Yehudah were eating porridge from a bowl. One was using his hands, and the other was using a utensil.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The one using a utensil - You cause me to eat dirt (from under your nails)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The one using his hands - You cause me to eat your saliva!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Beluspine (a kind of date difficult to digest) was put in front of R. Yehudah and R. Shimon. R. Yehudah ate, but R. Shimon did not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> Why aren't you eating?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> These never leave one's system!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> That is all the more reason to eat them. They will satiate us also tomorrow!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>R. YEHUDAH'S CONDUCT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">R. Tarfon (to R. Yehudah):</span> Why is your face glowing today?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> Yesterday we ate spinach without salt. Had we eaten it with salt, all the more so our faces would be glowing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A woman saw (the radiance of) R. Yehudah, and thought that he was drunk.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The woman:</span> One who decides laws is drunk?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> The only wine I drink is for Kidush, Havdalah, and the four cups on Pesach, and then my head hurts from Pesach until Shavuos. Rather, "a man's Chachmah illuminates his face"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">A heretic (to R. Yehudah):</span> 'You look as happy as those who lend on interest or raise pigs'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> A Yisrael may not do either of those! Rather, there are 24 latrines between my house and the Beis Medrash, and I regularly make use of all of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yehudah would carry a barrel to the Beis Medrash to sit on.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> Melachah is great. It honors the laborer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon would carry a basket for the same reason.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yehudah's wife bought wool and made a nice garment. She would wear it when she went to the market; R. Yehudah would wear it when he prayed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When he wore it, he blessed 'Blessed is He who clothed me with a mantle!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel once declared a fast; R. Yehudah did not come. They told R. Gamliel that he did not come because he did not have a garment. R. Gamliel sent to him a garment, but R. Yehudah did not accept it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yehudah lifted the mattress and showed the Shali'ach great wealth (this was a miracle). He said 'I have money, just I do not want to get physical pleasure in this world.'</p>
