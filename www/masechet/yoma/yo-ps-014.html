<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>KOHEN GADOL ONEN (cont'd)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But in our Mishnah R. Yehudah lets the Kohen Gadol Onen do the Avodah (provided he has a replacement wife)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is Yom Kipur where there is no fear of eating.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is there Aninus, given that she is divorced?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps not legal Aninus, but certainly anguish.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MISHNAH: DURING THE SEVEN DAYS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Kohen Gadol does the Zerikas ha'Dam, the Ketores, prepares the Neiros, and is Makriv the Rosh and Regel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>All year round it is his prerogative to be Makriv and to take the portion in the edible Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A TAHOR PERSON BECOMING TAMEI FROM THE HAZA'AH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Our Mishnah must not follow R. Akiva, who holds that a Tahor upon whom there was Haza'ah becomes Tamei, as cited in the Beraisa (and the Kohen Gadol could not then do the daily Avodah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The source is a Mishnah regarding (un)intentional Haza'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Akiva learns from "Al ha'Tamei" that a Tahor becomes Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Rabanan interpret "Al ha'Tamei" to speak only of articles which may become Tamei (but a Tahor person <i>certainly</i> remains Tahor).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Akiva holds that this is one of the mysteries of the Parah about which Shlomoh wrote that it is beyond him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rabanan hold that reference to speak about the Mazeh and the one sprinkled upon being Tahor while the Nogeah is Tamei).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mazeh is Tamei in the Pasuk?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mazeh is the Nogea.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But <i>both</i> are listed (and further, they have different laws regarding clothing)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Mazeh is the carrier.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then why did the Pasuk say Mazeh?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To teach that it requires the Shiur of Haza'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But what of the opinion that there is no Shiur for Haza'ah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is for how much is sprinkled, not how much there needs to be originally available (which does have a Shiur, as we find in the Mishnah).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Our Mishnah could even be R. Akiva, and we are speaking where the Haza'ah is done at the end of each day.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE ORDER OF KETORES AND NEIROS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>From our Mishnah we may infer that Ketores came before arranging the Neiros.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But from the Mishnah in Tamid it seems the opposite?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The author of the Mishnah in Tamid is R. Shimon Ish ha'Mitzpeh (whom we know to have a different order).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But from the Beraisa in Tamid it seems clear that he did not author the Mishnayos there!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah, here, is R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But there is still a contradiction, since we have a Mishnah wherein the Ketores is after the Neiros!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Ketores comes <i>before</i> the two latter Neiros, and <i>after</i> the first five.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the <i>Ketores</i> interrupt among the Neiros (we were taught by Abaye himself that it was the Dam Tamid)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Abaye was teaching the view of Aba Shaul (while we are speaking of Abaye explaining the Rabanan).</p></div>
