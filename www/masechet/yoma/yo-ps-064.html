<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>RESOLVING THE BERAISA REGARDING MECHUSAR ZMAN (cont'd) [Another answer to explain why we would have prohibited the Sair ha'Mishtale'ach bi'Mechusar Z'man.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer (Rava):</span> It is speaking where the mother of the Sa'ir was slaughtered on that day (for an ill person) thus creating the prohibition of Oso ve'Es B'no.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we are not doing Shechitah on the child on the same day as the mother, we are only pushing it off a cliff!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> For the Sa'ir ha'Mishtale'ach, that is its Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE STATUS OF THE SECOND SA'IR - DICHUI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The remaining Sa'ir from the <i>original</i> pair is used, and the match to the <i>new</i> Sa'ir is put out to pasture.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The opposite (original is pastured, new one is used).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the basis for their dispute?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav holds that the principle of Dichui does not apply prior to Shechitah; while R. Yochanan holds that Dichui does apply to Ba'alei Cha'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Rav hold his position?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns it from the usual case of Mechusar Z'man, which will become fit even though at the moment it is not fit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But by Mechusar Z'man the animal never went through a period in which it was fit, unlike our case?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Rav compares it to the case of an animal with a temporary blemish.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence do we know that such an animal may be subsequently offered?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the Pasuk  "Mum Bam" (only while the blemish is upon them may they not be offered).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Yochanan hold his position (and not learn, as Rav did, from an impermanent Mum)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because the Torah restricted its Heter there with the word "Bahem" (Mum is the only Nidcheh which comes back).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will Rav understand "Bahem"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Bahem" teaches that the Isur of Mum only applies if the limb of the Ba'al Mum can be identified, but not in a mixture (as we see is R. Eliezer's position in the Mishnah in Zevachim).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence then will R. Yochanan learn this Din?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The word "Bahem" could have otherwise read 'Bam'.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will Rav understand 'Bam'-"Bahem"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav does not interpret the difference between them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why, according to Rav, <i>must</i> we offer the original Sa'ir, why not offer either one?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav holds like R. Yosi that the proper Mitzvah is with the first one designated.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where is this opinion of R. Yosi?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When R. Yosi explains the requirement to mark the Kupos as in order to use the first one first.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that may be required since the second has not yet become usable when the first Kupah was available, but here all the Se'irim become available at the same moment (conclusion of the Matnos Damim)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the source is R. Yosi regarding the Korban Pesach which was lost, replaced and then found where R. Yosi holds that the first is to be used, unless the second one is superior to it.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">64b----------------------------------------64b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Mishnah seems to imply Rav's position while the Beraisa seems to imply R. Yochanan's.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah says that the new animal la'Shem stands in the stead of the one which died, but does not say that the new Mishtale'ach stands in stead of the first (like Rav).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Beraisa teaches explicitly that the Sheini is the new Sa'ir, whose partner had not died.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>APPLYING THE POSITIONS OF RAV AND R. YOCHANAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Yehudah (also) taught in our Mishnah that the Sa'ir ha'Mishtale'ach must be put to death if the blood la'Shem spilt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> While this is understandable according to R. Yochanan (Ba'alei Cha'im Nidachin), why, according to Rav is this Ba'al Chai Nidcheh?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav admits that he is not teaching his position in R. Yehudah, but rather in the Rabanan (see Rashi for how the Rabanan's position implies that Ba'alei Cha'im are not Nidachin).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav's position explains R. Yehudah's argument with the Rabanan, but according to R. Yochanan, what is their argument (they both speak of the same animal)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> That is (another reason) why we said earlier that the Mishnah implies the position of Rav.</p></div>
