<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>PLAITING THE ANIMALS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Yochanan taught, like a braid.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>BURNING THE ANIMALS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that those who burned the Par and Sa'ir would not cut it up after flaying it (like an Olah); rather, it would be cut up without flaying.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know both of these things (that they cut them up and did so without flaying them)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The words "Or", "Basar" and "Peresh" link the Par/Sa'ir to the Chatas Kohen Mashi'ach (where there was Nitu'ach without Hefshet).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source by Chatas Kohen Mashi'ach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa learns it from the Pasuk "ve'Hotzei".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it should also be <i>burned</i> whole?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> By linking it to the Olah the Torah teaches that the parts are to be separate.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should learn from Olah that it requires Hefshet?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "ve'Kirbo u'Firsho" teaches that it was burnt without Hefshet.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do those words demonstrate that?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Papa):</span> The Torah links the removal of the Eimurim and Peresh with flaying the hide and flesh of the Par, that both are done without Hefshet.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TUM'AS BEGADIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Why does the Torah speak of leaving <i>three</i> Machanos for Sereifah by the Par ha'Eidah (He'elam Davar) and Kohen Mashi'ach, while by the Par Yom ha'Kipurim, which is identical, the Pasuk speaks of leaving only <i>one</i> Machaneh?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must be that the <i>one</i> Machaneh identifies the point of <i>Tum'as</i> Begadim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the Par He'elam Davar is burned outside three Machanos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk "ve'Hotzei ... mi'Chutz la'Machaneh" implies outside three Machanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this implies outside <i>one</i> Machaneh?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are three indications of going out.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Two references to taking out.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The Pasuk teaches that the Par ha'Eidah is to be burnt in the same way as the Par Kohen Mashiach.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>These combine to push us out of three Machanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What will R. Shimon do with "mi'Chutz la'Machaneh"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It serves to link the Parah Adumah with the Par Yom ha'Kipurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Thus the Shechitah of the Parah Adumah is outside the three Machanos, like the burning of the Par.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Further, the Par Yom Kipur is done in the East, like the Parah Adumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where would the Rabanan (who do not utilize "mi'Chutz la'Machaneh" in this way) locate the burning of the Par and Sa'ir?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">68b----------------------------------------68b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the North, outside the three Machanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi):</span> In the Beis ha'Deshen, meaning that ashes from the Mizbe'ach must first be brought to that place to render it a Makom Shefech ha'Deshen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Which Tana disagrees with this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Eliezer b. Ya'akov, who interprets "El Shefech ha'Deshen": to mean that the place must be on a tilt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Perhaps R. Eliezer b. Ya'akov is coming only to <i>add</i> that requirement (not to disagree)!?</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>TUM'AS BEGADIM ONLY FOR THE ONES WHO BURN THE PARAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The ones who do, or assist in, the actual burning contract the <i>Tum'ah</i>, but not the ones who arrange or ignite the wood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>It is a Machlokes regarding the point beyond which the Parah no longer imparts <i>Tum'ah</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> Once it is ash.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer b. R. Shimon):</span> Once it is scorched and not thought of as Parah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>MISHNAH: KNOWING THAT THE SAIR REACHED THE MIDBAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Kohen Gadol was notified of the Sa'ir's arrival at the Midbar, such that he may continue the Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>There are three opinions regarding how they knew:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> They would wave a signal from one lookout to the next back to Yerushalayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> They would time the return of the first group of escorts to when the usher would arrive at the Midbar (three Mil to Beis Chidudo).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yishmael):</span> The red thread would turn white.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We see that Beis Chidudo is in the Midbar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>This teaches that, according to R. Yehudah, <i>arrival</i> alone to the Midbar is sufficient to allow the Kohen Gadol to continue the Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK #7 BA LO KOHEN GADOL</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>MISHNAH: READING THE PARSHIOS OF YOM HAKIPURIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Kohen Gadol went to the Ezras Nashim (dressed either in the Bigdei Lavan or in his personal white garments).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Sefer Torah was passed by the Shamash of the Beis ha'Keneses to the Gabai who handed it to the S'gan who gave it to the Kohen Gadol.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Kohen Gadol read from 'Acharei Mos' and 'Emor'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>He then rolled up and held the Sefer, announcing that there is more contained within.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>He read the Parshas of Musaf (from Pinchas) by heart.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>He recited eight Berachos, as listed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>The burning of the Par/Sa'ir and the Keri'as ha'Torah took place at the same time in different locations such that one who attended one could not attend the other.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>BENEFIT FROM THE BIGDEI KEHUNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>From the Mishnah which allows the Kohen Gadol to wear personal clothing, we may infer that Keri'as ha'Torah is not an Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>From the Mishnah which permits him to wear the Bigdei Lavan we may infer that it is permitted to derive benefit from the Bigdei Kehunah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the Keri'ah is a Tzorech Avodah (but general benefit may <i>not</i> be derived from Bigdei Kehunah) given that deriving benefit from Bigdei Kehunah is a subject of investigation?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah in Tamid (that Kohanim are only restricted regarding sleeping but may eat in their Begadim) was invoked to prove that they <i>may</i> derive benefit from them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Perhaps there, too, the eating is a Tzorech Avodah and may not generalize to all forms of benefit.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that the owners get Kaparah when the Kohanim eat their Chata'os and Ashamos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This lends support to referring to their eating as a Tzorech Avodah, even if it is not, itself, an Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The Mishnah in Tamid (by restricting sleeping) seems to imply that walking about in the Bigdei Kehunah is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>In fact such strolling is not permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why, then, did the Mishnah single out sleeping as being impermissible?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The reference to sleeping is necessitated by the Seifah which permits them to fold up their garments and place them under their heads whilst they slept.</p></div>
