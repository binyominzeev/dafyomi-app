<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>HO'IL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We have an indication (from his teaching regarding a Korban Pesach during the year) that R. Chisda does <i>not</i> employ the perspective of Ho'il, contrary to what we learned regarding Shechutei Chutz!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Chisda taught that a Korban Pesach during the year does not incur the Chiyuv of Shechutei Chutz if the Shechitah is le'Shem Pesach (since it could not be brought then).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Korban Pesach was slaughtered she'Lo Lishmo (i.e. as a Shelamim), he would incur the Chiyuv (since it could be brought as a Shelamim).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We may infer that if he slaughtered the Korban Pesach with no special intention that he would be Patur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is that so; Ho'il should give it a status of Shechutei Chutz since it <i>could have</i> been brought she'Lo li'Sh'mo as a Shelamim!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is no comparison, since the Korban Pesach needs to be removed from its Lishmo state (Akirah) whereas the Sa'ir of Yom Kipur needs no Akirah to be used as a Sa'ir for Musafin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rabah b. Simi taught that the contradiction above was not in R. Chisda but in Rabah (the answer remains the same).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THREE APPROACHES TO AKIRAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Dimi cites R. Yirmiyah as saying that he is Patur even if he does the Shechitah she'Lo li'Sh'mo.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>When asked for a rationale, R. Yirmiyah explained that Akirah only works in the Azarah (such that this Korban remains a Pesach she'Lo bi'Z'mano and is hence Patur from Shechutei Chutz).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Ravin cites R. Yochanan as teaching that in all instances he is <i>Chayav</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Could this mean that he is Chayav even if the Shechitah is li'Shmo!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But we learned that a Korban she'Lo bi'Z'mano is Patur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Mishnah lists those Korbanos which are Mechusar Z'man and Patur (whose owners are not yet ready to bring such a Korban) and which cannot convert into Nedavos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Those Korbanos which can convert to Nedavos are Chayav if, qualifies R. Chilkiyah b. Tuvi, the Shechitah was li'Shmo, but Shelo Lishmo is <i>Patur</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But li'Sh'mo by Ashamos should be Chayav on account of Ho'il!, as by the Korban Pesach?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> An Asham requires Akirah while a Pesach does <i>not</i> require Akirah as it automatically converts to a Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Ashi cites Ravin/R. Yochanan as saying Chayav (like our text) while;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Yosef mi'Difti cites them as saying Patur, as he holds that a Pesach <i>does</i> require an Akirah to become a Shelamim, and he is Patur because Akirah outside of the Azarah is not an Akirah (and he argues with R. Chilkiyah b. Tuvi who holds that Akiras Chutz <i>is</i> an Akirah (as in d.3. above).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SHECHUTEI CHUTZ AFTER THE HAGRALAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>As taught above, after the Hagralah he is only Chayav on the Sa'ir la'Shem.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Beraisa cites the Pasuk dealing with Shechutei Chutz and (says that the word "Korban" teaches that the Isur is only Kodshim ba'Chutz, not Chulin bi'Fenim and then) asks:</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">63b----------------------------------------63b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the word "Korban" comes to add Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis to those Kodshim for which one would be Chayav for Shechutei Chutz?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The words "ve'El Pesach Ohel Moed... " restrict the Isur to those Korbanos which <i>could</i> be brought there, and that which could not be brought to the Pesach Ohel Mo'ed is Patur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we should then not exclude the Sa'ir ha'Mishtale'ach which is brought to the Ohel Moed for Hagralah, and one should be Chayav for it!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "la'Hashem" restricts the Isur to Korbanos whose Avodah is only la'Shem (and not the Sa'ir ha'Mishtale'ach).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find that "la'Hashem" is used to <i>include</i> the Sa'ir ha'Mishtale'ach!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Each instance of "la'Hashem" must be understood in its context.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Where "El Pesach" (by Shechutei Chutz) includes; "la'Hashem" excludes;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Where "Isheh" (by Mechusar Z'man) excludes; "la'Hashem" includes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are we to infer that a Sa'ir ha'Mishtale'ach would be Kadosh even as Mechusar Z'man, had the Pasuk not taught otherwise?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But that would mean that one of the animals in the Goral was not be fit to be brought la'Shem.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We know that both must be fit la'Shem!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosef):</span> The Beraisa which employs "la'Hashem" to include the Sa'ir ha'Mishtale'ach in Mechusar Z'man is Chanan ha'Mitzri (who holds that a replacement Sa'ir ha'Mishtale'ach is brought without Hagralah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> While it is true that Chanan ha'Mitzri allows the use of Dam which was Dechuyah (temporarily unusable), but who says that he allows the Sa'ir to come into service without Hagralah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Beraisa is R. Shimon who teaches that the replacement can be brought without Hagralah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer (Ravina):</span> The Beraisa speaks of a case where the Sa'ir ha'Mishtale'ach contracted a Mum after the Hagralah and its substitute does not then require Hagralah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence that a Mum invalidates the Sa'ir ha'Mishtale'ach?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa analyzes the words in the Pasuk dealing with Mumin and finds two words combining to teach that both Mechusar Z'man and Ba'al Mum will invalidate the Sa'ir ha'Mishtale'ach.</p></div>
