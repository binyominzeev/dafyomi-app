<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CHATZI SHIUR (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it is permitted by the Torah, he is not considered Mushba ve'Omed, and his Shevu'ah can thus apply.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Mishnah regarding Shevu'as ha'Eidus teaches that a Shevu'ah <i>cannot</i> apply to an Isur mi'de'Rabanan!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The requirement of bringing a Korban for Shevu'as ha'Eidus (if he is sworn to testify but then denies, falsely, that he has any information) applies only to one who is otherwise fit as a witness.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Who does this exclude?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> It excludes the King (who may not testify due to his honor) and is Patur from bringing a Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Acha b. Ya'akov):</span> It excludes (and exempts) those who are Pasul mi'de'Rabanan from testifying, such as a gambler.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>A gambler is only excluded mi'de'Rabanan and yet the Shevu'ah does not apply to him!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>By extension, the same should be true for a Shevu'as Bitui which should not apply to an Isur de'Rabanan!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shevu'as ha'Eidus is different since it cannot apply to the gambler who, having been excluded mi'de'Rabanan, is not subject to the Lav of not testifying.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE WORD ASUR APPLIED TO A CHIYUV KAREIS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we <i>do</i> find the word 'Asur' used regarding a Chiyuv Kareis!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that the Chiyuv Kareis only applies to eating and drinking, not to the other afflictions.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Still, the term 'Asur' is used for <i>all</i> the Inuyim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The term 'Asur' applies to Chatzi Shiur, even as it is true that eating a full shiur would incur Kareis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> The term 'Asur' is used, since it applies to the other Inuyim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>This is supported by the citation from the Sha'ar Sifrei d'bei Rav that the word "Shabason" is the license given to the Chachamim to add other Inuyim onto eating and drinking (the same way that Shabason is used to add other Melachos onto the 39 on Shabbos), and they are called <i>Isurim</i>.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CHATZI SHIUR (cont'd)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Yochanan holds that Chatzi Shi'ur is an Isur Torah while Resh Lakish holds it is an Isur de'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yochanan holds that things which may aggregate must be viewed, from the outset, as the Isur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Resh Lakish holds that the Torah specifically prohibited Achilah (and less than a Shi'ur is not called Achilah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan of Resh Lakish):</span> The Beraisa (searching for the Isur of eating Chelev Koy as well as Chatzi Shiur finds the word "Kol") indicates that a tiny amount <i>is</i> an Isur Torah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The word "Kol" is an Asmachta which the Rabanan use.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This seems likely, since, if it were an actual Isur Torah, it would be prohibiting Koy.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is not reasonable that the word "Kol" would come to prohibit a Safek (since it is only a doubt for <i>us</i>)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is not an indication, since that Tana could hold that Koy is a separate creature, necessitating a special word to prohibit its Chelev.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">74b----------------------------------------74b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is supported by the statement of R. Idi b. Avin in Kerisus, where 'Kol' in the Beraisa comes to include Koy.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Again, there, the Pasuk could not be including a Safek!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>INUY ON YOM KIPUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that the Inuy is only through passive, not active affliction ('Shev ve'Al Ta'Asei').</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps if he finds himself in the sun he should not move into the shade (or the opposite)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Inuy is comparable to Isur Melachah, where we do not distinguish within the same activity (an act is either a Melachah or it is not, just as sitting in the sun is either an Inuy or it is not).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Beraisa further teaches that Inuy is like Melachah on Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just as Melachah is prohibited elsewhere (as by Shabbos), so, too, Inuy is Chayav elsewhere (as by eating Pigul and Nosar).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We are not to think, however, that only the Kareis foods are prohibited on Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Pasuk is understood to prohibit other foods (Tevel, Neveilah, Chulin, Terumah, Kodshim) to be eaten on Yom Kipur, all from the inclusive word "Te'anu".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If one would argue with the implications of "Te'anu", another support may be brought to include all foods from the reference to Inuy which causes loss of Nefesh (eating and drinking).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>What is the need for the the Pasuk if one would argue support?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps one would feel that "Te'anu" refers to Arayos, the Torah thus speaks of Inuy which causes loss of Nefesh, meaning eating and drinking.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The Tana de'Bei R. Yishmael links the Inuy of Yom Kipur with the Inuy to which Hash-m subjected the people in the Midbar, both being based on hunger.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Learn from Lavan's use of the word "Te'aneh" that it refers to abstention from cohabitation?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable to link general distress and not to personal distress.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Link it to the general distress in Mitzrayim which, we have learned, was Perishus Derech Eretz!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we link to deprivation by Divine decree (Yom Kipur and the Man in the Midbar) and not to deprivation by human decree.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE DEPRIVATION OF THE MANNA IN THE MIDBAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Ami and R. Asi argue over what the deprivation involved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One said it was the lack of 'Pas be'Salo'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One said it was the inability to see (differentiate) the food.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosef reported this as the source that a blind person does not feel satisfied.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Abaye further taught that food should be eaten when it is light.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Zeira supported this with the Pasuk "Tov Mar'eh Einayim... "</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Resh Lakish extended this to the pleasure of seeing one's wife.</p></div>
