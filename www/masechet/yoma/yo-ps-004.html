<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Resh Lakish (who learns Perishah from Sinai) where was there sprinkling at Har Sinai?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> And is it better for R. Yochanan (Milu'im was blood and Parah is water)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The water substitutes for the blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was only a Ma'alah which Chazal added to Parah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One Beraisa supports R. Yochanan and another Resh Lakish.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Beraisa supporting R. Yochanan explains be'Zos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It refers to the Perishah of Aharon for seven days.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Beraisa mentions Moshe's role during that time.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>An extension of Moshe's role is carried out by two 'students of Moshe.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Chazal extended this Perishah to Parah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Both Perishos involve sprinkling (and water takes the place of blood).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>The Beraisa cites a second Pasuk, which is explained as before, La'asos- Parah; Lechaper- Yom ha'Kipurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the word "be'Zos" is needed internally?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "be'Zos" (as opposed to ba'Zeh or be'Eileh) teaches two lessons.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Beraisa need a second Pasuk?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have erred, limiting the Perishah to either the first Kohen or to the first Yom ha'Kipurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>The Beraisa supporting Resh Lakish shows (according to Rashi) how R. Yosi ha'Gelili learns Perishah (for all times) from Sinai.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is a dispute regarding which days had a covering of a cloud (and what was being covered).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi Ha'Gelili):</span> These six days are after the Aseres ha'Dibros.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Akiva):</span> These days are the first six days of Sivan.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">4b----------------------------------------4b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The cloud covered not Moshe, but the mountain.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Moshe was called on the seventh day (for the Aseres ha'Dibros) and B'nei Yisrael stood and heard.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Noson):</span> Only Moshe needed Perishah, in order to cleanse away his food (not required for all times).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Masia b. Cheresh):</span> The Perishah was to instill trepidation in Moshe (the proper mood to receive Torah).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rejoice with trembling seems contradictory.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Where there is joy (receiving Torah) there should be trembling.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the basis of the dispute between R. Yosi ha'Gelili and R. Akiva?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Their dispute parallels a dispute over which day the Torah was given (sixth or seventh of Sivan).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi ha'Gelili aligns with the Tana Kama who holds the sixth (since the Tana Kama cannot agree with R. Akiva, as the Gemara explains).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Akiva aligns with R. Yosi who holds the seventh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the 40 day count to 17 Tamuz work according to R. Yosi ha'Gelili (who has the Perishah <i>after</i> the Aseres ha'Dibros)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The forty days includes these six of Perishah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HEARING THE VOICE OF HASH-M</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Akiva (in 1.g.3.ii. above) supports R. Elazar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Elazar also taught that Moshe heard as did the people.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Pasuk singles out Moshe only to honor him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa teaches that only Moshe heard?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They all heard Sinai; whereas only Moshe heard the voice at the Ohel Moed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Keriah was heard by all; Dibur was heard only by Moshe.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE IMPENETRABLE CLOUD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One Pasuk has the cloud being impenetrable, and another has Moshe walking right into it!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Hash-m grabbed Moshe, bringing him into the cloud.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The cloud parted as did the sea.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>LESSONS IN DERECH ERETZ</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Keriah before Dibur?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To teach the Derech Eretz of calling a person before speaking to him (supported by R. Chanina).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Also from these Pesukim we learn to protect confidentiality.</p></div>
