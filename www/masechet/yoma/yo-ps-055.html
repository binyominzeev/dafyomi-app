<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MATZLIF</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Matzlif?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah demonstrated the motion of giving lashes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Haza'os (even the upper one) were not <i>on</i> the Kapores (only the position of his hand differentiated between the upper and lower Haza'os).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the Haza'ah was not on the Kapores itself?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the extra "Lifnei" which modifies the "Al".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should learn the reverse, where the "Al" modifies the "Lifnei" (and thus have the Haza'ah <i>on</i> the Kapores)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Such a reversal would occupy the le'Ma'alah by Par and leave le'Matah by Sa'ir unused.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HAZA'OS LEMATAH BY SA'IR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How Many Haza'os le'Matah are there by Sa'ir?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> By inference (using Damim) from Par le'Matah we know it is seven.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should derive Sa'ir le'Matah from Sa'ir le'Ma'alah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more logical to compare Matah to Matah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To the contrary, it is more logical to derive Sa'ir from Sa'ir!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From "Ka'asher Asah" we learn to compare Sa'ir to Par.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HAZA'OS LEMA'ALAH BY PAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How Many Haza'os le'Ma'alah by Par?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Damim" links Par to Sa'ir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps derive Par le'Ma'alah from le'Matah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ma'alah to Ma'alah is more logical.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To the contrary...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ka'asher Asah".</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE COUNTING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>There is a difference in the Beraisa between the counting as described by R. Meir (one and the number below) versus R. Yehudah (the number below and one).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The difference is based on each one's local counting custom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But why, according to all, must we count one the one le'Ma'alah together with each one le'Matah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Either to prevent counting errors (R. Elazar, and the requirement is de'Rabanan) or (according to R. Yochanan) it is d'Oreisa based on "Yazeh".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When will their answers differ?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In a case where he did not count the le'Ma'alah but he also did not err.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE GOLD SHELF IN THE HEICHAL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>We learn from R. Yehudah that there was only one Shofar for Kinei Nedavah, and none for Kinei Chovah, to prevent mixing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yosi asserts that our concern involves mixing Chovos with Nedavos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Make two Shofros and mark them!?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">55b----------------------------------------55b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah must not rely on Kesivah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The same rationale as above will apply to making only one shelf in the Heichal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Mishnah teaches that even according to R. Yehudah there were multiple Shofaros (and there he <i>must</i> rely on Kesivah)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The concern of mixing (and why there is no Shofar for Chovah) is (not like R. Yosi said but rather) for a Chatas whose owner may have died.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Mishnah teaches that we do not consider such a possibility of death.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is actually a Gezeirah lest we find out that an owner <i>had</i> died, and we will not know which coins are his.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then take four Zuz and cast them away!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah does not rely on B'reira to permit the Isur.</p></div>
