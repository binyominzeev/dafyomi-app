<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>If the patient says that he needs food and the physician says that he does not, we rely on the patient (proof text that a heart knows its own pain).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That seems obvious!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We need to be taught to listen to the patient given the physician's expertise.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If the patient says he does not need food and the physician says that he does, we feed the patient, and attribute the patients' feelings to delirium.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah, which says that we feed the patient based on the opinion of experts, contradicts both of the above assertions.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It implies that we rely on experts (ie physicians), and not on the patient.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It further implies that we need the opinion of  <i>at least two</i> experts (the plural is used) and not on one!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yanai):</span> We are speaking of a case where the patient says that he does not need food, in which case we defer to two physicians.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Let us then feed him based on <i>one</i> physician!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are speaking of a case in which the patient also has one physician supporting his refusal to eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it not obvious that we will feed a patient if experts say that he should eat, given that we are lenient even if the threat to life is a doubt!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We need to be taught the Din in the case where two physicians support the patient, indicating that he need not eat (to teach that the patient does not combine with those two physicians supporting him).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>This takes into account the view of R. Safra that in matters of assessment, we rely not on two (which establishes matters of testimony), but on the majority of all opinions.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>The patient, however, does not create such a majority.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>This is because the majority for assessment only applies to monetary matters, but does not eliminate Safek Nefashos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Seifa teaches that, in the absence of experts, we feed him, based on his own sense of need (indicating that the Reisha is also speaking where he indicates a need to eat) not like R. Yanai asserts!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is missing text which provides for this shift.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar b. R. Ashi):</span> A patient indicating his need to eat overrides all opinions to the contrary since a heart knows its own pain.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But our Mishnah indicates that we do <i>not</i> rely on him against expert opinions!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must modify our understanding of the Mishnah to permit feeding him when he says he need not eat and the experts say that he does.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>However, when he indicates a need to eat, the opinions of the experts are disregarded, as taught.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MISHNAH: URGENT NEEDS TO EAT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One who suffers from an attack of Bulmus is fed until his eyes regain their light.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One who has been bitten by a rabid dog may not be fed from its Chatzar Kaved, since it is not an established Refu'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Masya b. Cheresh permits giving it, since he considers it an established Refu'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Masya b. Cheresh further taught that it is permitted to be Mechalel Shabbos (by preparing the medicine) for throat (or teeth or gums - Rosh, Bartenura) pains (Safek Nefashos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If there might be a Jew buried beneath a heap, we must dig through the rubble, stopping only when the person is saved or discovered to be dead.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE BULMUS ATTACK</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How would we know if the light has returned to his eyes?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When he can differentiate between good and bad (meaning its taste- Abaye).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>In the absence of permitted food, we feed him prohibited food, ha'Kal Kal (least Isur first).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Neveilah (Malkos) before Tevel (Misah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Isur Shemitah (Asei) before Tevel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Tevel and Terumah is a Machlokes in the Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If taking off the Terumos and Ma'aseros will leave enough to satisfy him, then all agree to do so.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>The Machlokes is when <i>all</i> the produce will be needed.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Ben Teima says Terumah before Tevel (so turn it first into Terumah).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Tana Kama holds Tevel first (leave it as Tevel without turning any into Terumah).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>Ben Teima holds that Tevel is worse because its Isur applies to everyone (while Terumah can, at least, be eaten by a Kohen).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>Tana Kama holds that Terumah is worse because it is irreparable (while Tevel can be tithed).</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>VIOLATING A DERABANAN FOR TEVEL DERABANAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is <i>obvious</i> that we would fix the Tevel if that would suffice!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We need to be taught to do so even if it is Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But even on Shabbos the Isur is only mi'de'Rabanan!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are speaking of food which is only Tevel de'Rabanan (and we are thus taught that they would agree that an Isur de'Rabanan is to be violated in order to fix an Isur de'Rabanan, lest people permit Tevel d'Oreisa). [However, where all the food will need to be eaten, one opinion holds that Tevel is worse, and one holds that Terumah is worse.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the issue of permitting a de'Rabanan (Tiltul) to fix Tevel de'Rabanan seems to be a Machlokes Tanaim!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one is bitten by a snake, Melachos may be performed to treat the victim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> We need not tithe the vegetables (medicinal herbs) cut on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar b. R. Shimon):</span> They must first be tithed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>It would appear that Rabah (3.c.4. above) holds like R. Elazar b. R. Shimon, but not like Rebbi!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even Rebbi would agree with Rabah that they must be tithed, and he was lenient in the Beraisa because we are speaking of vegetables whose obligation is de'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rebbi would agree that Tevel d'Oreisa must be fixed even in a case where the Chiyuv is de'Rabanan (such as in an Atzitz She'eino Nakuv).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is lest people apply this Kula to an Atzitz Nakuv.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE BEST FOODS FOR A BULMUS ATTACK</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Sweet foods are best for restoring the light to his eyes (alluded to in the Pasuk in Shmuel I, 14:29 where Yonasan reports that he his eyes lit up after tasting a bit of the honey).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That seems like a clear proof, not just an allusion!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not a clear proof, since Yonasan was not then suffering from Bulmus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Sweets only restore the light to one's eyes when eaten after food, but before food they only intensify the hunger (proof text from Shmuel I, 30:11-12).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> The best food for Bulmus is a sheep's tail in honey.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Huna b. R. Yehoshua):</span> Also fine flour in honey.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> 'I once (during a bout of Bulmus) ate from the eastern side of a fig tree' (wisely recalling the teaching of R. Yosef who learned from the Pasuk that the sweetest fruit is to be found on that side).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Yehudah (while travelling with R. Yosi) was struck with Bulmus and stole away the loaf of a passing shepherd, raising the rebuke of R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Upon reaching the city, R. Yosi was struck with Bulmus and all the townspeople gathered to bring him sweets to heal him, whereupon R. Yehudah indicated that R. Yosi troubled many more people than just the shepherd.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>INFERRING FROM NAMES AND MAYIM ACHARONIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>In the reported incident, R. Meir was able to suspect the innkeeper, based on the implications of his name.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>He was not permitted, however, to report his suspicions to R. Yehudah and R. Yosi, who entrusted their purses to the innkeeper.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>They were able to retrieve their purses by deceiving the man's wife, pointing out that they knew what she had made him for the previous meal (as evidenced on his mustache).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The innkeeper then killed his wife for giving back the stolen purses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This is what the Beraisa means when it states that someone who does not wash Mayim Rishonim may end up eating forbidden food (as the innkeeper would assume him not to be Jewish) and one who does not wash Mayim Acharonim may end up causing bloodshed (as in the reported incident).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Subsequently, the Chachamim also began inferring from names, and did not trust Balah (based on the Pasuk "ve'Amar le'Balah Ne'ufim").</p></div>
