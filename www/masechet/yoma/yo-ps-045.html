<p class="dedicationbox">YOMA 45 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE COLOR OF THE GOLD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> There are seven types of gold, each listed with its name derivation.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ashi):</span> There are five types, each comes in regular and Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A Beraisa is cited to affirm that the gold called Parva'im derives its name from its similarity to the blood of Parim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE EXTRA FINE FLOUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The extra word "Dakah" teaches us a finer ground over the already fine ground normally required.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE KOHANIM GOING UP ON THE RIGHT SIDE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>As we were taught, that all turns in the Mikdash are to the right, eastward.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>TODAY THE KOHEN GADOL GOES UP THE MIDDLE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>This is to honor the Kohen Gadol.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>TODAY THE KOHEN GADOL DOES KIDUSH FROM THE GOLD KITON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>This, too, is to honor the Kohen Gadol.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>FOUR MA'ARACHOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa lists the opinions of R. Yehudah (two Ma'arachos), R. Yosi (three) and Rebbi (four) and what purpose each one would serve (all opinions add one for Yom Kipur to the following):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Ma'arachah Gedolah (all opinions)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Ma'arachah Ketanah for Ketores (all opinions)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Kiyum ha'Eish (R. Yosi and Rebbi)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>For incompletely burnt Eivarim and Pedarim (Rebbi only)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The source Pesukim for the two Ma'arachos (upon which all agree) are cited.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The source for Kiyum ha'Eish is cited (R. Yosi).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What will R. Yehudah do with this Pasuk?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah will learn that the Alisa must be lit on the Mizbe'ach (as we find the opinions of both R. Yehudah and R. Yosi in the Beraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence will R. Yosi learn the rule regarding igniting the Alisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The same way R. Shimon learns it in the Beraisa (applying the Pasuk to Alisa since it could not be teaching us the obvious Halachah that a Zar cannot go on the Mizbe'ach).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then why doesn't R. Yehudah use the same source?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That source could allow a Zar to ignite the Alisa on the Mizbe'ach using a blower while standing on the ground.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for the Ma'arachah of Eivarim and Pedarim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Vav of "ve'Eish".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What will the Rabanan do with that Vav?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not subject to interpretation.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What will the Rabanan do with those unburnt Eivarim and Pedarim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk indicates that we should put them back on the Ma'arachah Gedolah (as cited in the Beraisa).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">45b----------------------------------------45b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What will R. Meir do with this D'rashah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that only unburnt parts of an <i>Olah</i> are returned to the fire, not those of the Ketores.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>ADDING A MA'ARACHAH FOR YOM KIPUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this (universally agreed) extra Ma'arachah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is learned from "<i>ve'ha'</i>Eish" (which is significant even according to those who do not learn a Vav alone).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is taught by "Eish Tamid"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As in the Beraisa, it teaches that the Ma'arachah for the Ketores is to be made on the Mizbe'ach ha'Chitzon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence do we know the Eish, Machtah and Menorah come from there as well?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The word/concept "Eish" connects them all to the Ketores (and a Pasuk is cited to prevent us from learning the connection in the reverse).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence that the fire for the Machtah comes from the Mizbe'ach ha'Chitzon, as well as the fire for the Menorah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are connected, again, by "Eish" (and the Pasuk prevents us from reversing the connection).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mizbe'ach ha'Chitzon is identifiable in the Pasuk as the one which is only partially Lifnei Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is learned from the redundant "Me'al ha'Mizbe'ach" and "mi'Lifnei Hash-m"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Each are needed to protect us from misidentifying the Mizbe'ach ha'Chitzon and the location on the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
