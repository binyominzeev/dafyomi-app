<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>R. AKIVA AND R. YOSI HAGELILI ON THE ORDER OF THE HAZAOS (cont'd)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> They would agree to learn P'nim from Chutz if the Kohen <i>walked</i> around the Mizbe'ach, but they argue over whether he stood in one place or walked around.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Second Alternate Answer:</span> They agree that he stood in place, but R. Yosi ha'Gelili learns Hakafas Yad from Regel and R. Akiva does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Yosi ha'Gelili held that he <i>walked</i> around (as R. Eliezer is <i>arguing</i> with him saying that he stood in place)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, they argue whether the Hakafah is be'Yad or be'Regel (as above), and they provide their rationale:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi ha'Gelili learns from "Saviv" that he must walk around to do the Zerikah as it is done on the Mizbe'ach ha''Chitzon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Akiva holds that he stands in place since the Mizbe'ach ha'Penimi is as small as one corner of the Mizbe'ach ha'Chitzon (and there is no requirement to walk around its <i>corners</i>).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Two former Kohanim Gedolim reported their practices, one having walked around and one stood in place, and each one justified his custom based on the rationale just given for R. Yosi ha'Gelili and R. Akiva.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HAZAAH FROM UP TO DOWN / DOWN TO UP</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Our Mishnah follows the opinion of R. Yehudah in his dispute with R. Meir regarding the opinion of R. Eliezer:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir says that the <i>opposite</i> corner is unique (the Haza'ah must be down to up there given the position of the Kohen) and the rest follow the closest corner (which must be up to down to protect his garments from being soiled).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah holds that the <i>closest</i> corner is unique (which, as stated, must be up to down) and the rest follow the opposite corner (down to up) [as in our Mishnah].</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TOHARO SHEL MIZBE'ACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Tohar of the Mizbe'ach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The middle of its height (as 'Tihara' refers to mid- day).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa implies (from its discussion regarding moving around the coals for the Haza'ah) that the Haza'ah is done on the <i>top</i> of the Mizbe'ach!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Tohar is the cleared top, as the word 'Tohar' means clear.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chananya):</span> The Haza'ah was on the Northern side of the top.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> It was on the Southern side.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the basis for their dispute?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue over whether the opening to the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim was North or South.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>They both hold that he does the Avodah where he finishes the Matanos (based on the Pasuk of "ve'Tiharo ve'Kidesho").</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE SHIRAYIM ARE POURED ON THE WESTERN YESOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>This is based on the Pasuk "Yishpoch El Yesod ha'Mizbe'ach".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Western Yesod is the one he encounters first as he exits from the Heichal.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE SHIRAYIM FROM THE MIZBEACH HACHITZON WERE POURED ON ITS SOUTHERN YESOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>We learn from Yom Kipur that the closest Yesod is to be used, hence the Southern Yesod is the closest to the Kevesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yishmael holds that the Dam from both Mizbechos (P'nimi and Chitzon) are poured on the Western Yesod.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Shimon b. Yochai says that both are poured on the Southern Yesod.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the basis for R. Shimon b. Yochai (since R. Yishmael is learning the unstated pouring (Chitzon) from the explicitly taught pouring (P'nimi, as 4.a. above).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that the opening to the Heichal was South of the Mizbe'ach ha''Chitzon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Yishmael was cited in the Beis Medrash of R. Shimon b. Yochai as having retracted (the students of R. Shimon b. Yochai drew R. Yishmael to their way of thinking).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>MEILAH BEDAMIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Meir and R. Shimon hold that there is Me'ilah in the blood of a Korban while the Chachamim say that there is no Me'ilah by blood.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">59b----------------------------------------59b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Mid'Oraisa there is no Me'ilah by Dam, and they argue only if there is Me'ilah mi'de'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for asserting that Me'ilah does not apply to Dam?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ula learns from "Lachem", R. Shimon learns from "Lechaper" and R. Yochanan learns from Kaparah (that the Dam is the same before Kaparah as after).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Let R. Yochanan learn the <i>opposite</i>, that just as there <i>is</i> Me'ilah before, so, too, after?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is never Me'ilah after a Mitzvah is completed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What about Terumas ha'Deshen (where we find that the ashes need Genizah and, presumably, are subject to Me'ilah, as well)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Terumas ha'Deshen combines with Bigdei Kehunah as unique (non-generalizable) Pesukim where there <i>is</i> Me'ilah after the Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This only works if "ve'Hinicham Sham" teaches that the Bigdei Kehunah require Genizah, but that is a Machlokes, and what will R. Dosa say?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Terumas ha'Deshen combines with Eglah Arufah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What about the opinion which holds that two Pesukim <i>may</i> generalize!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Still, these cases remain unique owing to the limiting word ("Vesamo" by Terumas ha'Deshen and "<i>ha'</i>Arufah" by Eglah Arufah) hence they will not generalize.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are there three Pesukim to teach that there is no Me'ilah by Dam?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The additional words teach two additional exceptions, that there is no Nosar nor <i>Tum'ah</i> on Dam.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Pigul does not need a Pasuk since Dam has no Matir (nothing is Matir <i>it</i>).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Pigul only applies to that which has a Matir.</p></div>
