<p class="dedicationbox">YOMA 44 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE FOURTH ROW OF THE HEICHAL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span>  But the Pasuk teaches that no person may be in the Ohel Mo'ed at the time of the Ketores?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah means <i>from</i> the Heichal, into the Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Beraisa provides the sources for the Halachos of staying out of the Ohel Moed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Lest we think that the prohibition also applies to the Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>To apply the restriction to Shiloh and to the Beis ha'Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>To extend the prohibition from Ketores to Matan Damim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>To extend the prohibition to the time of his departure.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>To teach the order of atonement (himself, his wife and Shevet, Klal Yisrael).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the time of Haktarah come to be assumed in the Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the Pasuk speaks of that which brings Kaparah to all.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the Ketores bring Kaparah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes, as we find that it did so in the Midbar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It atones for Lashon Hara.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A private offering for a private transgression.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>BETWEEN THE ULAM AND THE MIZBE'ACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Mishnah teaches that during the Ketores we must remove ourselves from the area between the Ulam and the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> This restriction applies only while the Ketores is brought in the Heichal  (not while it is brought in the Kodesh Kodshim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But from the Beraisa we see that we are Poresh from between the Ulam and the Mizbe'ach while the Ketores is brought, and presumably this is the Ketores in the Kodesh Kodshim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the Beraisa is speaking of the Ketores in the Heichal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In that case there should have been no question looking for Ma'alos of the Heichal over the area between the Ulam and the Mizbe'ach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This, indeed, is the difference which the Beraisa intended (and the Beraisa referred to the time that the Ketores is brought in the Kodesh Kodshim as the time it is not being brought in the Heichal).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">44b----------------------------------------44b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But there is another Ma'alah of the Heichal, as regards the Perishah at the time of Matan Damim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is considered part of the same Perishah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence do we know the Perishah at the other times (Matan Damim of the Kohen Mashu'ach, etc.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are derived through a Gezeirah Shavah from Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that the Ma'alos listed in the Mishnah in Keilim are d'Oreisa (and the rest of the Azarah is distinct from the area Bein ha'Ulam la'Mizbe'ach), since if the distinctions are de'Rabanan, then the same concern of trespassing should apply throughout the Azarah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> While the Kedushah is the same throughout the Azarah, the Mizbe'ach serves as a reminder in the rest of the Azarah, unlike past the Mizbe'ach where there is no reminder.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE KEDUSHAH OF THE ULAM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We see from the above that the Ulam has the same Kedushah as the Heichal, for otherwise the Gezeirah regarding Bein ha'Ulam la'Mizbe'ach is a Gezeirah li'Gezeirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>No, the Ulam has the same Kedushah (and is subject to the same Gezeirah) as Bein ha'Ulam la'Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE GOLDEN SHOVEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this Machtah of gold, rather than the usual silver?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah has compassion on Jewish funds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the Kohen Gadol not required to transfer the coals to the gold Machtah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In deference to his weakened state.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE SURPLUS KAV OF COALS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa teaches that there were <i>two</i> Kavim of leftover coals (this seems too large or too small to match the differentials mentioned by either Rabanan or R. Yosi)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is the opinion of R. Yishmael b. R. Yochanan b. Berokah (who learns that he went in with two Kavim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ashi):</span> It could even be the opinion of R. Yosi, if we understand the switch from Midbar measures to Yerushalayim measures.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>THE LIGHTER MACHTAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Tana taught that it's walls were normally thicker, and thus it was heavier than the one for Yom Kipur, also its handle was normally shorter than this one.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why the need for the longer handle?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> So that the Kohen Gadol might use his arm to support it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>A Tana also taught that it normally did not have a noise- making ring, which (the Ben ha'S'gan reported) it <i>did</i> have on Yom Kipur.</p></div>
