<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE TEN MIRACLES OF THE MIKDASH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>When B'nei Yisrael would fill the Mikdash, they would stand crowded, and would prostrate themselves with generous room.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They would fill the 11 Amos behind the Kapores.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this add?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even though they were <i>so</i> crowded, still...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This was one of the ten miracles, as listed in Avos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The last two depart from the Mikdash and speak of Yerushalayim!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There were two others in the Mikdash, as taught in the Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The rain never extinguished the fire of the Ma'arachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The wind could not move its column of smoke.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But there were others (violating the limit of 10)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beraisa- Broken shards were absorbed into the ground.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Abaye- The Mora, Notzah, ashes of the Mizbe'ach and Menorah were also absorbed into the ground.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The three Pesulim in the original list are counted as one (so we remove two and add two).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then the absorbing should all be counted as one!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is also the Lechem ha'Panim ('Siluko ke'Siduro').</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But there is also the miracle of the Aron and Keruvim!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Only externally visible miracles are in the count.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then the Lechem ha'Panim should not be counted?!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer: (Resh Lakish):</span> The Lechem ha'Panim were raised and made visible to the people (as a sign of Divine love).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Torah insists that the Shulchan be Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This implies that it could somehow be Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Yet the Shulchan was a <i>stationary</i> wooden K'li?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>As such it could not become Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>It must be because it was raised...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the golden trees were another miracle?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Fixture miracles were not counted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>We then understand why the Aron and Keruvim, which were also fixed, were not counted.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE UNMOVABLE COLUMN OF SMOKE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There was no smoke from the Atzei Ma'arachah (The Beraisa teaches five qualities of the fire of the Atzei Ma'arachah, among them that there was no smoke)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The smoke was from the required man-made flame (not that which came down from Shamayim, as in the Beraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Was the flame crouching like a lion or a dog?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> First Mikdash (lion) and second Mikdash (dog).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Divine flame was absent from the second Mikdash (learned from the missing Heh)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was there but it did not help burn.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SIX TYPES OF FLAMES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that there are (have been) six types of flames in the world, which varying on eating and drinking.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The pillar of smoke from the Ma'arachah cannot be shifted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we were taught that the column did shift!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>All looked at, and interpreted, the direction of the smoke after Sukos!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The southern wind, pushing the column North, was good news for the poor (the produce would be sold at discount) and bad news for the landowners (the great quantity of rain would make it impossible to store the produce).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Similarly, each wind direction brought tidings of the rains to come.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The column tilted, but did not disperse.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There seems to be a contradiction regarding the benefits of the various winds!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Each is beneficial for (and detrimental to) a different product.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Northern wind (which recalls where the Shulchan stood) enhanced the grains.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The South (where the Menorah stood) enhanced the oil.</p></div>
