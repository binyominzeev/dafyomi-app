<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>IDENTIFYING THE NATIONS IN THE PESUKIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Yochanan told Resh Lakish that the Nimshal of the Pasuk is not as he said (there would not be Shechinah in the second Mikdash in any case because it was built by the Persians [from Yefes]).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the Persians are descended of Yefes?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Beraisa identifying Tiras as Persia.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>More identifications...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Savta and Savtecha (inner and outer regions).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Bavel, Erech, Akad, Chalneh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Ashur, Nineveh, Rechovos, Kalach, Resen.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The large city...is Nineveh (based on Yonah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Achiman, Sheishai, Talmei, Yelidei ha'Anak.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(cited in the name of Rebbi):</span> Rome is destined to fall before Persia (proof text).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do you know that Tze'irei ha'Tzon is Persia (the proof text could also refer to Greece)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>The sage of Eretz Yisrael clarified how it refers to Persia.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(cited in the name of R. Yochanan):</span> Rome is destined to fall before Persia.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is logically derived from the builders/destroyers of the first Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Persia is destined to fall before Rome.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can the builders fall before the destroyers?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the King so decrees.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate answer:</span> The Persians also destroyed synagogues, and the King has so decreed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Rome must ultimately prevail over the world for nine months prior to Israel's redemption (proof text).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MEZUZAH IN THE MIKDASH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Only the Lishkas Parhadrin (the residence of the Kohen Gadol) must have a Mezuzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But other Lishkos (also residences) did not?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Gezeirah (lest the Kohen Gadol be considered incarcerated).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why isn't residence enough to obligate?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> R. Yehudah holds that only year-round residences are obligated in a Mezuzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> But we find winter/summer homes called Bayis?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are called winter-homes, not simply homes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Yehudah obligates a Mezuzah in a<i> Sukah</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There could hardly be a more seasonal dwelling.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>And if you'll suggest that the obligation is only de'Rabanan...</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>But he also makes the produce brought directly into the Sukah subject to Ma'aser (and this we would not do unless the obligation was d'Oraisa, for fear of errors).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> They agree that Sukah is obligated in Mezuzah during the week of Sukos; they argue about whether (Chachamim) or not (R. Yehudah) to extend that obligation to the rest of the year.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> But the Mishnah teaches that the Chachamim <i>argue</i> about Mezuzah during Sukos!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Rather, there is no argument during the year (exempt) and they only argue during Sukos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Sukah and Lishkah have separate bases for the argument.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Sukah):</span> R. Yehudah holds that Sukah must be of a permanent nature; Rabanan hold it must be a temporary dwelling.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Lishkah):</span> Chachamim hold that an imposed dwelling is called a dwelling; R. Yehudah holds it is not (and the obligation for a Mezuzah, as mentioned, is a Gezeirah).</p></div>
