<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISHNAH: CHILDREN FASTING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>There is no obligation to withhold food from children on Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A year or two before their coming of age we train them to fast part of the day.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHAT IS MEANT BY A YEAR OR TWO</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we educate children <i>two</i> years prior, then need we even be told that we train them <i>one</i> year prior?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chisda):</span> One year is for an ill child; two for a healthy one.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Huna):</span> <i>Girls</i>: Chinuch Sha'os begins at eight years old for a healthy child; nine for a weak one, while a 10 (healthy) and 11 (weak) complete the fast Mi'd'Rabanan (12 year olds complete the fast mid'Oraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman):</span> <i>Boys</i>: Chinuch Sha'os begins at nine (healthy) or 10 (weak); completing the fast Mi'd'Rabanan begins at 11 (healthy) or 12 (weak) (13 year olds complete the fast mid'Oraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Chinuch Sha'os begins at 10 (healthy) or 11 (weak) (there is no completion of the fast mi'de'Rabanan) and the 12 year old completes the fast mid'Oraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will R. Yochanan explain the year or two before in the Mishnah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Huna and R. Nachman will explain that the Mishnah is speaking only by a weak child and both expressions (one year and two years) refer to the self same time.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One year prior uses as its reference the weak child's obligation to complete the fast mi'de'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Two years prior is in reference to the child's Torah obligation for completing the fast.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, R. Yochanan does not have Hashlamah de'Rabanan, hence these expressions cannot refer to the same date.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Do not use the term prior (Lifnei) in the Mishnah, which means, simply, a year or two before their age of majority.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>A Beraisa states the date as R. Yochanan would teach it, that Chinuch (presumably Sha'os) begins a year or two before their Perek.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will R. Huna and R. Nachman explain that Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chinuch in the Beraisa means Hashlamah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since when would we refer to Hashlamah as Chinuch (the Beraisa teaches that Chinuch is to delay the child's meal by an hour)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are two types of Chinuch, Sha'os and Hashlamah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MISHNAH: PREGNANT WOMEN AND THE ILL PERSON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A pregnant woman who develops a life-threatening craving for something she smells, is fed until she is calmed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>An ill person is fed, based on two medical opinions.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>In the absence of medical experts, we rely on the patient, until he indicates that he has had enough.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE CARDINAL SINS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that if a woman develops a life- threatening craving for Kodshim or Davar Acher it is permitted to feed it to her, because nothing stands before saving a life, except Avodah Zarah, Arayos, and Retzichah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>First we dip a spindle into the gravy of that forbidden food and let her suck it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If that does not help, we give her the gravy itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If that does not help, we give her the forbidden food.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for Avodah Zarah standing before saving a life?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the obligation to love Hash-m with one's Soul (i.e. one's life).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence the obligation to forfeit life and not violate Arayos and Retzichah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the fact that the Torah calls Arayos as akin to an act of murder (which we shall see shortly).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In Arayos as in Retzichah, it is permitted to save the victim at the expense of the life of the pursuer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In Arayos, as we know by Retzichah, one must forfeit one's life in order to avoid violating the prohibition.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">82b----------------------------------------82b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know to assume that a potential murderer himself must sacrifice his life?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is logical, as in the incident brought before Rava.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The petitioner asked Rava if he is permitted to commit murder to save his own life.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rava told him to allow himself to be killed, since he has no basis to assume his own life to be more precious (redder blood) than his neighbor's (and the permission to transgress in order to save a life does not apply here, since anyway someone is going to die).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>The case of a woman who had such a craving was brought before Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He told them to whisper in her ear that it is Yom Kipur and to see what happens.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They did so and her (the fetus') craving passed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rebbi used the Pasuk to refer to this fetus as destined for greatness.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>That child grew to become R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>The opposite outcome occurred (the fetus did not relent) in the case brought before R. Chaninah and the child became a notorious price gouger.</p></div>
