<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE PROPHETIC RIVER FROM THE KODESH HAKODOSHIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Pinchas citing R. Huna of Tzipori):</span> The River will begin as a tiny rivulet and grow in size as it proceeds out of the parts of the Mikdash, as listed, each alluded to in the Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>It will become a deeper river at the door of David ha'Melech's home.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Navi Zecharyah refers to the river at David's door as suitable for Tevilah (Zavin, Zavos, Nidos, Yoldos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yosef wished to learn from here that a Nidah must do Tevilah in water which reaches her neck when she sits in it (but this is not the Halachah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>CROSSING A RIVER ON SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would it be permissible to cross a river on Shabbos (where he <i>would</i> be wearing shoes), for fear that he might carry his shoes?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Nechemyah reported that R. Ami and R. Asi crossed while wearing their shoes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What about sandals (less firmly strapped to the leg)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Richumi reported seeing Ravina cross in sandals, however, R. Ashi taught that one should not do so Lechatchilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Ravina did not come to the D'rashah of the Resh Gelusa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rafram tried to diminish the anger of the Resh Gelusa which was directed at Ravina for his absence.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>In the presence of the Resh Galusa, Rafram asked Ravina about his absence.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>After a series of possibilities are raised and refuted, Ravina indicated that he could not cross the river in sandals, in deference to the teaching of R. Ashi.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ACTIVITIES WHICH ARE SIMILAR TO RECHITZAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah b. Grogeros):</span> One may not sit in mud on Yom Kipur (owing to its cooling moisture).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua b. Levi):</span> We are speaking of moist mud.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Moist enough to make something else wet.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> It is permitted to (touch or rub fruit in order to) cool oneself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah would use a gourd to cool himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rabah would touch a baby.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rava would touch a silver cup.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> The silver cup must not be full of water (lest some spill and lead to Rechitzah).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>It is permitted if the cup is only partially full.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>An earthenware cup (which exudes the moisture from within) may not be used with any water.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ashi):</span> Even a partially filled silver cup may not be used, lest it slip from his hands.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The innkeeper reported to R. Yosef, the son the R. Yehoshua b. Levi, his father's practice regarding using the remaining moisture in a wrung-out cloth (prepared the day before) to wipe his face, hands and feet on Yom Kipur (and on <i>Tish'ah</i> be'Av he let the cloth dry and used it that day).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>This report was confirmed by Rabah b. Mari (that R. Yehoshua b. Levi was Machmir additionally on Yom Kipur to assure that the cloth was fully wrung out Erev Yom Kipur).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Ya'akov to R. Yirmiyah b. Tachlifah):</span> 'But you taught us the opposite' (that he was more careful to wring out the cloth Erev <i>Tish'ah be'Av</i> and we asked you why he was not concerned about Sechitah on Yom Kipur!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>(According to the second Girsa in Rashi, he was more Machmir on Erev <i>Tish'ah</i> be'Av [only drying his hands with the cloth and using its residual moisture on <i>Tish'ah</i> be'Av] whereas on Erev Yom Kipur he soaked and wrung out the cloth.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>PERMISSION TO JUDGE THE MUM OF A BECHOR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (asked of R. Elazar b. P'das):</span> Must an established Dayan receive permission from the Nasi to check the Mumin of a Bechor, or is he exempt?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the question?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The question was if the requirement to ask Reshus given in order to aggrandize the Nasi (in which case none are exempt) or to check for sufficient expertise (in which case an expert would be exempt).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Tzadok b. Chalukah reported that the elder Dayan R. Yosi b. Zimra still asked permission of the young Nasi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> R. Yosi b. Zimra was a Kohen and he (was not asking Reshus as above, but rather) deliberated the question of whether a Kohen may check the Mumin of another Kohen's Bechor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Kohanim may not check their own Bechoros, since they have personal interest in the matter.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir holds that, by extension, they may not judge the Mumin of others.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Shimon b. Gamliel holds they are Ne'eman on others.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Yosi b. Zimra was told that the Halachah is like R. Shimon b. Gamliel.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>ALTERNATE SANDALS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it permitted to go out with a hard rubber sandal (Sha'am) sandal on Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yitzhok b. Nachmeini reported that R. Yehoshua b. Levi wore such a sandal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He asked R. Yehoshua b. Levi if it is permitted on a Ta'anis Tzibur (see Rashi), and he said it is the same.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rabah bar bar Chanah saw R. Elazar wearing it on a Ta'anis Tzibur, and asked regarding Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Gemara reports the foot coverings worn by R. Yehudah, Abaye, Rava and Rabah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rami b. Chama):</span> But we find in the Mishnah that alternate (non-leather) sandals are forbidden on Yom Kipur!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah in Shabbos is dealing with the permission for an amputee to wear his prosthesis on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Even R. Yosi, who does not consider his prosthesis to be a shoe for clothing purposes on Shabbos, would hold that it is a shoe regarding Yom Kipur!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The issue there revolves around the cloth- lined device which the amputee used (forbidden because of Ta'anug) but here we are permitting hard, uncomfortable (non-leather) shoes.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Would simply inserting cloths turn a non-K'li into a K'li (a shoe which is forbidden on account of Ne'ilas ha'Sandal)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Additional Question:</span> Is every enjoyment (even if it is not a shoe) forbidden on Yom Kipur (we learned that Rabah b. R. Huna wrapped cloth around his feet)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Additional Question:</span> The Seifa there speaks where his prosthesis has a Beis Kibul (to insert cloths), which indicates that the Reisha is speaking where there is no such place for cloths!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The prosthesis is a shoe (and thus forbidden on Yom Kipur), and the discussion there is whether we are concerned that it might slip off and be carried.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>CHILDREN AND INUYIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Children are not restricted by the Inuyim, except for Ne'ilas ha'Sandal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this singled out?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Lest people think that an adult helped them on with their shoes.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then the same concern should apply to Rechitzah or Sichah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People will say that the washing was done Erev Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then why won't people assume that the child slept in his shoes, tied before Yom Kipur, as well?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is not done, as Shmuel taught, that sleeping with tied shoes is deathly uncomfortable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa says that the other Inuyim are entirely permitted for children (even for adults to help them), so why should Ne'ilas ha'Sandal be different!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shoes are not needed for a child's development (unlike Rechitzah etc.) and Chazal therefore forbade them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Abaye, citing a mother, reported the development needs of a child:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>First to be bathed in warm water and smeared with oil.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Later to be fed an egg in a dip.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Later to be given toys to play with and break (as Rabah bought inexpensive breakables for the youngsters).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>THE KING AND THE KALAH WASH THEIR FACES...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>These exemptions are the teaching of R. Chananyah b. Teradyon (citing R. Eliezer) in the Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the King exempt?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As the Pasuk teaches, a King in his beauty...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why a Kalah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> So that she should not be unseemly to her husband.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> For how long is she considered a Kalah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 30 days, as taught in the Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>WEARING SHOES IN THE FACE OF DANGER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Eliezer (cited by R. Chananyah) had taught that a nursing mother wears shoes, out of concern for the cold.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Shmuel clarified that wherever there might be danger (such as from scorpions), all would be permitted to wear shoes.</p></div>
