<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>APPLICATIONS OF R. YOCHANAN (cont'd)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>An implication of the Mishnah (which teaches that a Chatas Tzibur is not put to death) is that a parallel Chatas Yachid would, according to the Chachamim, be put to death.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>An instance of this can be found according to R. Yochanan (who says that the Sheini which is pastured is of the first pair) in accordance with the Din of R. Aba citing Rav, that such a Chatas Yachid would die.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav (that the first Sa'ir is used and the second is pastured), the animal should not be worse than a backup animal and should pasture even by a Korban Yachid!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Given that Rav holds like R. Yosi that the Mitzvah is with the first, the second Sa'ir is like an animal which was Nikdash but which could <i>never</i> be used, and, in the opinion of Rebbi, would be destroyed if it was a Chatas Yachid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Mishnah teaches that, according to R. Yehudah, the animal (which would pasture according to Chachamim) is put to death.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan would make sense of R. Yehudah's statement since the second pair remains for the Kaparah (and the remaining animal of the first pair is pastured by the Korban Tzibur and put to death according to R. Yehudah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav, however, which animal will serve as the Kaparah?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The second of the first set will be Nidcheh (Ba'al Chai).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The second of the second will be put to death!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah was not addressing the same animal which the Chachamim asserted would pasture (second of the second pair); he was speaking of the second of the <i>first</i> pair.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Yehudah disagrees and holds that a Chatas Tzibur <i>is</i> put to death.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Yehudah also disagrees and holds that second of the first pair dies.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>We earlier (64b para. 3.b) asked on Rav from 've'Od Amar R. Yehudah' and we now have an alternate rendering of that question, now posed as a question on .R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What, according to R. Yochanan, does 've'Od Amar R. Yehudah' come to add that we do not already know from his statement, 'Tamus'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Good question.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE DEATH OF THE SAIR HAMISHTALE'ACH AND SPILLING THE DAM LASHEM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Yehudah taught that if the Dam la'Shem is spilled, the Mishtale'ach must die, and if the Mishtale'ach dies, the Dam la'Shem must be spilled.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why, if the Mishtale'ach dies, must the Dam be spilt, given that the minimum Mitzvah of the Mishtale'ach (the Goralos) was already accomplished (and Shilu'ach is not Me'akev)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Based on "Yo'amad Chai", R. Yanai learns that the Sair ha'Mishtale'ach must be alive for the Matanos la'Shem of its partner.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>USING A LOST-AND-FOUND SA'IR FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why may the Sa'ir not be used for the following year, rather than pastured or left to die?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding lost-replaced-and-found Shekalim we learned that the Tana Kama holds that they are Hekdesh but they do not count for the next year, whereas R. Yehudah holds that they <i>do</i> count for the following year.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's rationale?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> R. Yehudah holds that over-payments in one year may be carried over to the next.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then our Sa'ir should also be able to be used the following year!?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">65b----------------------------------------65b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We cannot apply Shekalim to Korbanos since the Korbanos of each year must come from the Terumah of that year, and hence there is no way to re-use the Sa'ir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the <i>Par</i> (which comes from the Kohen Gadol's personal funds) should be able to be brought the following year!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Gezeirah lest we confuse the Par and the Sa'ir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Will a Gezeirah cause the Par to die (it should rather pasture and be redeemed as a Ba'al Mum)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Additional Question:</span> We have learned that, Bedi'eved, we <i>are</i> Yotzei with the Korban taken from the Terumah of the previous year!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> Rather, they may not be re-used because the Goral of one year cannot apply to the next.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then bring another animal and do a new Goral!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not permit this lest people not know that a new Goral was performed and they may assume that it is possible to rely on last year's Goral.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What about the Par (no Goral)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Gezeirah lest we bring the Sa'ir without a Goral, as well.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Will a Gezeirah cause the Par to die!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, they may not be re-used as a Gezeirah lest the Sa'ir pass its first year by the following Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is not a Gezeirah, it is a certainty!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is possible, according to Rebbi who (learning from selling a home in an Ir Chomah) says that we count a Shanah Temimah which is a solar year, and a late Yom Kipur, followed by an early one, could result in the animal not yet passing its first year.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What about the Par (see Tosfos)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Gezeirah...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Will a Gezeirah...?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Additional Question:</span> A Chatas whose year has passed is pastured, not put to death, as taught by Resh Lakish!</p></div>
