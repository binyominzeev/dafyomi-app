<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>RETRIEVING THE KAF UMACHTAH IN THE ORDER OF THE PASUK</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> All of the Avodos listed in the Pesukim are in order excepting the retrieving of the Kaf u'Machtah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we assume this is out of sequence?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chisda):</span> If it were in sequence, we would not have five Tevilos and 10 Kidushin as is our tradition (since he would remain in the Bigdei Lavan to retrieve the Kaf u'Machtah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Perhaps there was (an unwritten) interruption, the outer-Sa'ir (Chatas ha'Kipurim), and the Pesukim remain in order?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Pasuk "ve'Yatza ve'Asa" teaches that the Ailim (in Bigdei Zahav) follow directly on his (first) emergence from the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Pesukim are not in sequence since "Asher Lavash" indicates that he changes <i>back</i> into Bigdei Lavan which he wore previously, (and changed out of for an earlier outside-Avodah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah b'R. Shila):</span> Perhaps the interruption was the outer Sa'ir and the Pesukim remain in order?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Pasuk "ve'Yatza ve'Asa" teaches that the Ailim (in Bigdei Zahav) follow directly on his (first) emergence from the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But this is <i>not</i> the only part of the Pesukim which are out of order!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Pesukim have the Eimurei Chatas offered before the Sereifas Par/Sa'ir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Mishnah has the Sereifas Par/Sa'ir earlier (coinciding with the Keri'as ha'Torah) and the Eimurei Chatas after!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa means that from Kaf u'Machtah onward the Pesukim are out of order.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why assume that the Pesukim are out of order when we can assume that the Mishnah is out of order!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Pasuk uses the term "ve'ha'Mishale'ach" to echo back to its earlier position (ie he sent it out before the Eimurei Chatas even though it is written after) so, too, the word "ve'ha'Soref" positions the Sereifah earlier (before the Eimurim), even though it is written after.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this connection teaches the <i>opposite</i> that both are done <i>after</i> the Eimurim!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> "ve'ha'Meshale'ach" (where the Pasuk could have said 've'Shilach') echoes back to an already known Meshaleach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Shiluach could not have been later (after the Eimurim and out of Pasuk-sequence) since the Sa'ir only needs to remain alive for the Matan Damim within ("Yo'omad Chai"), not longer (as for the Eimurei Chatas).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>GREETING THE KOHEN GADOL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The usher returns to Yerushalayim and reports back to the Kohen Gadol.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he finds the Kohen Gadol in a public place, he honors him by saying that he executed his mission.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he finds him in private, he honors Hash-m by proclaiming that he fulfilled the mission of the One Who sustains the living.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>AGADIC INSIGHTS REGARDING LIFE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> When Talmidei Chachamim would take leave from one another they would say, 'May the Sustainer of the living grant you long, good, upstanding years'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> The 'Land of the Living' refers to the marketplaces (where people find their provisions.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>'Years of Life' refer to years in which a person's fortune turns to the good, and he feels newly alive.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THREE FROM R. BERECHYAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>'Aleichem Ishim Ekra' refers to scholars who appear weak yet accomplish acts of great valor ('Eizehu Gibor... ' - Maharsha).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>It also teaches that one who wishes to merit offering libations on the Mizbe'ach should provide wine for scholars.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If one sees Torah ceasing from his offspring, he should marry the daughter of a scholar (proof text from Iyov).</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>AN EMBARRASSING KOHEN GADOL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>In the reported incident, a Kohen Gadol's pride was hurt when the people turned to follow Sh'maya and Avtalyon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>When Sh'maya and Avtalyon took their leave of the Kohen Gadol, the latter referred to them derogatorily (making reference to their non-Jewish ancestry).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>They rebuked the Kohen Gadol for not following in the peace- loving steps of his ancestor, Aharon ha'Kohen (and transgressing Ona'as Devarim).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE GARMENTS OF THE KOHANIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Kohen Gadol served in eight garments (those listed for a Kohen Hedyot as well as the Choshen, Eifod, Me'il and Tzitz) while a Kohen Hedyot served in four (Kesones, Michnasayim, Mitznefes and Avnet).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Only when wearing his eight garments may the Urim ve'Tumim be consulted, and then only on behalf of the King, Av Beis Din and him whom the Tzibur requires.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>THE THREADS OF THE GARMENTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Where the word "Sheish" is used, the threads of each material are made six-ply while the word "Mashzar" implies eight-ply threads, Paroches-24 ply, and Choshen/Eifod-28 ply.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for six-ply threads?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is implied by one of the five references to linen (the word "Sheish" four times plus the word "Bad") in the Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that "Sheish" means linen?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi b'R. Chanina):</span> Since "Bad" (which appears alongside "Sheish" in the Pasuk- Tofsos Yeshanim) implies that which emerges from the ground alone (as the linen derives from the stalk, not from its leaves).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this refers to the wool-thread?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Wool splits, unlike Pishtan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Pishtan also splits when processed?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Pishtan only splits under the pressure of its process, whereas wool is inherently stranded.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> The Pasuk in Yechezkel teaches us that the garments (referred to in the Pesukim as "Sheish") are Pishtan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did we know that before Yechezkel?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was a tradition handed down from Moshe and only recorded by Yechezkel.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If not, then how can we understand the statement (of R. Chisda regarding the prohibition of a Kohen Areil not serving) that it is known from Yechezkel (and not from the Torah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>That surely must have been an existing tradition.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that "Mashzar" means eight-ply?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We link the word "Mashzar" to the Paroches where the 24 threads were comprised of four materials, each of six- ply, so, too, the Rimonim were 24, three materials of each of eight-ply.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Link it rather to the Choshen/Eifod which is 28 threads?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more logical to link those items which do not contain gold (than to introduce the Choshen/Eifod which does).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To the contrary, link garments (the Rimon to the Choshen/Eifod) and do not introduce that which is not a garment (the Paroches)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we link the Rimon to the Avnet (which is a garment and gold is absent).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Mari):</span> The word "Ta'asenu" is meant to make the Choshen <i>unique</i> an no other garments will have 28 threads.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ashi):</span> The word "ve'Asisa" teaches that each of the materials must have an equal number of threads, which is not possible if we link to Choshen (28 divided by three).</p></div>
