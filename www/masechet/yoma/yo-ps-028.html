<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ALTERNATE RENDITION OF THE QUESTION OF R. ZEIRA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira to R. Yochanan):</span> How can a Zar be Chayav Misah for Sidur ha'Ma'arachah, given that it is not the last Avodah (Avodah Tamah)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But by Eivarim and Pedarim a Zar is Chayav even though there is Terumas ha'Deshen which follows?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are the end of the day's Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Terumas ha'Deshen which is followed by the Hotza'ah and yet (according to Levi) a Zar is Chayav?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is the start of the day's Avodah (as we saw from R. Yochanan's requirement of washing).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a good question, and R. Yochanan should be rendered as referring to Sidur of the two Gizrei Eitzim (that a Zar is Chayav since it is Avodah Tamah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If this Sidur is so important then it should be allocated by a Payis?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It <i>does</i> get a Payis, as an extension of the Payis of Terumas ha'Deshen!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We meant, it should get a Payis of its own.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As we said in the first Lashon.  We skip to Amar Mar Zutra following Rashi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra or R. Ashi):</span> A Mishnah supports R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The coming Mishnah teaches that we check for daybreak in anticipation of Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We do not check for Sidur Gizrei Eitzim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Thus, they must be Kosher at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Perhaps not, but we only check for irreparable Avodos.</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK #3 AMAR LAHEM HAMEMUNEH</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MISHNAH: CHECKING FOR DAYBREAK</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The appointed Kohen calls for someone to climb up and check for daybreak to allow for the Shechitas ha'Tamid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The observer calls out 'Barkai'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Masia b. Shmuel says:</span> The entire East until Hevron is lit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>He (see Gemara) says 'Hen'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This procedure was necessitated by an incident in which the moonlight was mistaken for daybreak, and the Tamid was invalidated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Once the call was made, the Kohen Gadol was taken down to the Mikvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>The rule in the Mikdash requires Tevilah for one who moved his bowels and washing from the Kiyor for one who urinates.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHO CALLED OUT WHAT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>There are five opinions cited (each implying a later time) as to what was called out.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The last opinion was that the people have gone out to their labors.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that is a <i>very</i> late time!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We meant the employers have gone out to hire laborers.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>LEARNING FROM AVRAHAM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Safra):</span> One should pray Minchah (called here the Prayer of Avraham) when the (East side of the) walls become dark.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do we learn Halachos from Avraham?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We find that the Tana does so (regarding Zerizus).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Should we then (in contradiction to the Mishnah which mandates 6.5 hours) slaughter the Tamid right at Chatzos?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> What a question, perhaps (even though Avraham prayed at midday) the walls of the Mikdash only darkened at 6.5 (given their construction, narrowing as they rose)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> Perhaps Avraham was particularly familiar with the skies and time?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Third Alternate Answer:</span> Perhaps Avraham was unique owing to his being an elder, studying in Yeshivah (as we know that from the Avos onward, the Jews never ceased intense study)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Mentioned are Avraham, the Jews in Mitzrayim, Yitzhok, Ya'akov, and Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Eliezer was Moshel, meaning he was completely familiar with the Torah of Avraham.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He was Damesek, teaching the Torah of Avraham to others.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Avraham Avinu fulfilled all of the Torah (proof text).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Maybe he only fulfilled the seven Noahide laws?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But surely he also fulfilled B'ris Milah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We meant the seven plus B'ris Milah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Mitzvosei ve'Sorosei" implies more than only the Mitzvos B'nei Noach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava or R. Ashi):</span> Avraham Avinu fulfilled even Eruv Tavshilin, as "Sorosei" implies both the written and oral Torah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>ANNOUNCING THE DAWN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who said 'Hen'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The one on the roof should not say it, lest he both dream and interpret!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The one on the ground is in no position to say it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It could have been either one.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>For the one on the roof, he called out the dawn; the one on the ground asked about Hevron, and the one on the roof said 'Hen'.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The one on the ground would say 'Hen' to confirm that, indeed, he was asking about Hevron.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>CONFUSING MOONLIGHT WITH SUNLIGHT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The diffusion of sunlight is broader than moonlight, precluding such an error!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was a cloudy day, and the moonlight diffuses broadly through the cracks between the clouds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>We learn from here that a cloudy day is all sunlight.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does that statement make?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One can spread the skins to dry anywhere.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> Everywhere outdoors is considered in the sun to prohibit kneading the Matzah dough there.</p></div>
