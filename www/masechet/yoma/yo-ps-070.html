<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ROLLING THE SEFER TORAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Kohen Gadol need to announce that there is more, i.e. that what he was about to read by heart is contained in the Sefer Torah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To avoid impugning the Sefer (leaving the impression that the Sefer was missing the Parshah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he read it by heart, rather than roll to it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To avoid burdening the Tzibur with the delay.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then they should bring another Sefer!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are afraid people will think the first Sefer is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> To avoid an unnecessary B'rachah (which would be needed over a new Sefer).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we see that we regularly bring out multiple Sefarim without concern for impugning the first!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is when a different person reads from each one, not when he reads from one and then switches to the other.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE EIGHT BERACHOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The B'rachah Al ha'Torah is as we say at public readings of the Torah ('Asher Nasan Lanu Toras Emes... ').</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Al ha'Avodah, Hoda'ah, Mechilas Avon are as we have them in our Nusach ha'Tefilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Mikdash, Kohanim, and Yisrael are the subject of separate Berachos.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE REST OF THE TEFILAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Nusach includes Rinah, Techinah and Bakashah, concluding with 'Shomea Tefilah'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Subsequent to the Tefilah of the Kohen Gadol, each person who had previously brought a Sefer Torah to the Azarah read from it to display its beauty.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>ATTENDING EITHER THE READING OR THE BURNING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is obvious that he can only attend one!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have thought that the principle of 'Ein Ma'avirin Al ha'Mitzvos' would prevent even a bystander from moving from one to the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Mitzvah are we speaking of?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Of honoring  Hash-m be'Rov Am.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE OTHER KORBANOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>If the Kohen Gadol read from the Torah in the Bigdei Lavan then:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He did Kidush Yadayim ve'Raglayim and undressed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He immersed, emerged, dried off and was brought, and donned, Bigdei Zahav, and did Kidush thereafter.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>(If he read in private garments, he would have done Kidush before removing the Bigdei Lavan, prior to Keri'as ha'Torah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> He went out and offered his Ayil, and the people's Ayil before the seven Kevasim of Musaf.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Akiva):</span> The seven Kevasim for Musaf were offered together with the morning Tamid, and the Par (Olah), and the Sa'ir (done outside) were offered together with the afternoon Tamid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>He did Kidush, undressed, immersed, donned Bigdei Lavan and did Kidush.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>He went into the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim to remove the Kaf and Machtah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>He went through the procedure again to change to Bigdei Zahav and offered the afternoon Ketores, and to arrange the Neiros.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>He did Kidush, removed the Bigdei Zahav, put on his own clothes and was escorted to his home where he hosted a Seudah, having emerged peacefully from the Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>THE PAR (OLAH)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Par (Olah) in R. Akiva's teaching is to be read as attached to the first clause (and is brought with the morning Tamid) or to the second clause (and is associated with the afternoon Tamid).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Additional Question:</span> When was the Par (Olah) done according to R. Eliezer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Additional Question:</span> When were the Eimurei Chatas brought?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> You will find one order listed according to R. Eliezer (in a Beraisa from Bei Shmuel) and one according to R. Akiva (in the Tosefta).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tana d'bei Shmuel teaches that, according to R. Eliezer, the Eimurei Chatas were right after the Ailim, and the Par le'Olah, seven Kavasim and Sa'ir were all associated with the afternoon Tamid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Tosefta teaches that, according to R. Akiva, the Par le'Olah is connected to the seven Kevasim, and with the morning Tamid (as a rule derived from "Mil'vad... ").</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Next is the Avodas ha'Yom (Hagralah, Chata'os Penimiyos) then (after the Par and Sa'ir within) bring the outer Sa'ir.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">70b----------------------------------------70b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>In spite of its being part of the Musaf, the outer Sa'ir is associated with the morning Tamid.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>This is drawn from the Pasuk "u'Se'ir Izim Echad Chatas - Mil'vad Chatas ha'Kipurim".</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>Next are the Ailim, then the Eimurei Chatas and then the afternoon Tamid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the rationale of R. Eliezer (for associating the Musafim with the afternoon Tamid, unlike the other Regalim when the Musafim are associated with the morning Tamid)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> First do the Avodos listed in 'Vayikra' (Par and Sa'ir Penimi'im), and then the Avodos listed in 'Bamidbar' (Musaf).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the rationale of R. Akiva?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As taught, "Mil'vad Olas ha'Boker... " implying that the Musafim come together with the morning Tamid (as well by Yom Kipur).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What will R. Eliezer do with "Mil'vad Chatas ha'Kipurim" (which R. Akiva used to put the outer Sa'ir before the Ailim)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To teach that they both (Sa'ir ha'Penimi and Chitzon) atone for the same things.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>OTHER OPINIONS IN THE TOSEFTA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah, citing R. Akiva):</span> One of the seven Kevasim is brought with the morning Tamid, and the other six with the afternoon Tamid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar b. R. Shimon citing R. Akiva):</span> Six with Shachar, one with Bein ha'Arbayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the rationale of these two renditions of R. Akiva (splitting up the Kevasim)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a resolution of two, seemingly contradictory Pesukim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What, then, is the basis of their dispute?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah holds to do the minimum Kevasim before the Avodas ha'Yom in order not to tire out the Kohen Gadol;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Elazar holds to do as many as possible lest he neglect to do them later, and the Kohan Gadol is Zariz and not likely to get weak.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>THE AYIL OF THE TZIBUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Both R. Eliezer and R. Akiva agree that only one Ayil is brought for the Tzibur, like the opinion of Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rebbi had taught that the Ayil mentioned in Acharei Mos is the same one mentioned in Pinchas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Elazar b. R. Shimon holds that there are two.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the rationale of Rebbi?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The extra word "Echad".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will R. Elazar b. R. Shimon learn "Echad"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Echad" means the finest (Meyuchad) of his flock.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will Rebbi learn the requirement of Meyuchad?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From "Mivchar Nedarecha (Nidreichem)".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will R. Elazar b. R. Shimon relate to these two references to Meyuchad?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One is for Korbanos Chovah and one for Nedavos (and each reference is needed- Rashi).</p></div>
