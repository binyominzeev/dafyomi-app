<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Nikanor went to Mitzrayim to bring the doors.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Upon his return there was a storm and the sailors threw one of the doors overboard.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Nikanor laid down on the second door to prevent its loss.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Upon his arrival in Ako, the second door miraculously appeared.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This was alluded to in the Pasuk in Shir ha'Shirim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>These were the only doors which were not later gilt, either to remind all of the miracle, or because of the quality of the copper.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MISHNAH: THESE WERE NAMED FOR DISCREDIT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Beis Garmu did not wish to teach others the procedure for making the Lecham ha'Panim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Beis Avtinas did not teach the making of the Ketores.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Hugras b. Levi did not share his unusual vocal talents.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Ben Kamtzar did not teach how to write four letters at once.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>BEIS GARMU AND THE LECHEM HAPANIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Rabbis were unsuccessful in their attempt to replace the members of Beis Garmu with Alexandrian bakers (they could bake just as well, but they could not do the Rediyah properly).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Rabbis saw that the honor of Hash-m would be raised through the knowledge granted to Beis Garmu (proof text).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Beis Garmu only returned when their wages were doubled (either 12-24 or 24-48).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>They explained themselves on the grounds of protecting this secret from would-be idolaters.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>To their credit, they would never allow clean flour in their homes, to be above suspicion of benefiting from the Lechem ha'Panim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>BEIS AVTINAS AND THE KETORES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Rabbis were unsuccessful in their attempt to replace the members of Beis Avtinas with Alexandrian craftsmen (they could not cause the smoke to rise as straight).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Rabbis saw that the honor of Hash-m would be raised through the knowledge granted to Beis Avtinas (a different proof text).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>As above, they returned when their wages were doubled, and justified themselves on the same grounds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>To their credit, they would never allow a bride to be perfumed, to remain above suspicion of benefiting from the Ketores.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yishmael remarked that justice had been done in that the honor of Hash-m was maintained and that of Beis Avtinas was reduced.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Yishmael b. Luga reported of the descendant who cried and laughed, but did not give over the secret.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Yochanan b. Nuri reported that one of their descendants gave over the secret, and R. Akiva indicated that they are not to be discredited any longer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Ben Azai learned from these incidents that a person should not be concerned, that he will surely receive that which was designated for him, for none can impinge on another, even an instant of one monarchy upon another.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Elazar explained "Yirkav" as spoiling of their names such that fathers will not use them for their sons.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Do'eg b. Yosef...?</p></div>
