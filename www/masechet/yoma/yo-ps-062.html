<p class="dedicationbox">YOMA 62 (8 Shevat) - Dedicated by Elliot and Lori Linzer in honor of<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Gila Linzer's Bat Mitzvah </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHICH SAIR IS THE MISHTALE'ACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Mishnah reported a Machlokes regarding the replacement Se'irim discussed by R. Meir and R. Elazar/R. Shimon above.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> Only the last Sa'ir is deal with as the actual one (it is burnt and those who deal with the burning contract <i>Tum'as</i> Begadim).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar and R. Shimon):</span> All of them must be dealt with in the same way.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In light of the above, how Many Se'irim are sent out as the Mishtale'ach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shall we send out his whole flock (surely, only one)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But he could have his whole flock burned (multiple Se'irim Lashem)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is no comparison since the Sa'ir ha'Mishtale'ach is restricted by "Oso".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>It is a Machlokes regarding the opinion of Rava whether to send out the first Sa'ir (R. Papi) or the last (R. Simi).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why the first (the second makes sense since the Kaparah was completed with its pair)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Papi holds like R. Yosi who holds that the Mitzvah is to be performed with the first animal so designated.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where is this opinion of R. Yosi?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When R. Yosi explains the requirement to mark the Kupos as in order to use the first one first.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that may be required since the second has not yet become usable when the first Kupah was available, but here all the Se'irim become available at the same moment (conclusion of the Matnos Damim)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the source is R. Yosi regarding the Korban Pesach which was lost, replaced and then found where R. Yosi holds that the first is to be used.</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK #6 SH'NEI SA'IRIM</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE PAIR OF SEIRIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The two Se'irim must be the same in appearance, height, price, and time of purchase.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This requirement, however, is not Me'akev (an example of an imperfect, but Kosher, pair would be if one Sa'ir died before the Goralos, a pair may be brought for the remaining Sa'ir).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If one died after the Hagralah, a new pair is brought and a Hagralah is used to determine the replacement for the one which died.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The second Sa'ir pastures until it develops a blemish (since a Korban Tzibur is not put to death).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> The extra Sa'ir is put to death.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Yehudah further teaches that if the Dam Sa'ir la'Shem was prematurely spilled out (such that another Sa'ir is slaughtered) then its corresponding Sa'ir ha'Mishtale'ach is put to death; similarly if the Sa'ir ha'Mishtale'ach dies, the blood of its counterpart is spilled out.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">62b----------------------------------------62b</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SOURCE FOR THE ALIKE PAIR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa draws from the word "Sh'nei" that the Se'irim must be alike.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that their similarity is not Me'akev?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the repetition of the (singular) word Sa'ir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence would we have <i>thought</i> that it <i>was</i> Me'akev?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The multiple repetition of "Sh'nei" might lead us to consider their being identical as Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then, now, what <i>is</i> the role of the three-fold repetition of "Sh'nei"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One for appearance, one for height, and one for value.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>The same sequence appears in the Beraisa regarding the two Kivsei Metzora, and in the Beraisa regarding the Tziporei Metzora.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If "Sh'nei" and "Sh'tei" teach the requirement of alike pairs, then the word "Shenayim" by the Temidim should teach the same Din there (as the sequence would work there)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The word "Shenayim" by Tamid is not extra; it is needed to teach that they must be slaughtered in the sunlight, not in the shade.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa goes on to demonstrate that the number here cannot be teaching the obvious number since the Pasuk is explicit regarding "the one... " and "the one... ".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where in the Azarah would the sunlit Shechitah take place?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tamid in the morning is slaughtered in the <b>NW</b> corner (angled back into the <b>SE</b> sun, using the second row of rings) and the afternoon Tamid is in the <b>NE</b> (angled back to the setting sun in the <b>SW</b>).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The Musafim of Shabbos should (according to Rashi) be alike.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE TWO SA'IRIM PRIOR TO THEIR HAGRALAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One is Chayav for Shechutei Chutz for slaughtering <i>either</i> Sa'ir prior to the Hagralah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>After the Hagralah one is Chayav only for the Sa'ir la'Shem.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Prior to the Hagralah neither animal is fit for a Korban, so why is there a Chiyuv on them?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since (Ho'il) they are fit to be the Chatas ha'Musafin (brought on the Mizbe'ach ha'Chitzon), they are deemed fit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Avodas ha'Yom needs to be completed before such a Sa'ir Musafin could be fit to be brought!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Timing alone does not render an animal unfit if its time will come that day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>With this lesson from R. Chisda (that missing an action, such as Hagralah, renders an animal unfit) we can understand the Din of R. Yehudah citing Shmuel:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Shelamim is Pasul if slaughtered before the gates of the Heichal are opened.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>By extension, the Chiyuv of Shechutei Chutz will not apply to that animal since opening the gates is like an action which stands between the animal and its fitness to be offered.</p></div>
