<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE RABANAN AND TEN KIDUSHIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rabanan, there are only nine Kidushin?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is a last one when he changes to Bigdei Chol.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE SECOND ENTRY INTO THE OHEL MOED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Kohen enter a second time?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To remove the Kaf and Machtah which he left there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This Pasuk, then, is out of order.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this so?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chisda):</span> We have a tradition regarding the five Tevilos and ten Kidushin, and keeping the Pesukim in their order would leave only three Tevilos and six Kidushin.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SOURCE FOR THE TEVILOS AND KIDUSHIN (THE BERAISA)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches the sources for the Tevilos and Kidushin provided by R. Yehudah ("u'Va Aharon... ") and Rebbi ("Kesones Bad Kodesh... ").</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah learns from the cited Pasuk that Tevilah is needed when going from Lavan to Zahav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rebbi learns from his Pasuk that Tevilah is needed when going from Zahav to Lavan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Beraisa reports an additional Pasuk ("Bigdei Kodesh Hem") which the Gemara will explain.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>All agree on the five Avodos under discussion.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Tamid Shel Shachar - Zahav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Avodas ha'Yom (inside) - Lavan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The two Eilim - Zahav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Removing the Kaf and Machtah - Lavan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Tamid Shel Bein ha'Arbayim - Zahav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence that each Tevilah requires two Kidushin?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "u'Fashat ve'Rachatz... " (Rebbi)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Eliezer b. R. Shimon learns it from a Kal va'Chomer (like R. Yehudah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Lest you think that, like the rest of the year, that there is only one Kidush on Yom Kipur...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Pasuk says "u'Va Aharon...Asher Lavash" to connect the disrobing to the donning (both require Kidush).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE ANALYSIS OF THE BERAISA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How, according to R. Yehudah, do we know the Tevilah when going from Zahav to Lavan?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">32b----------------------------------------32b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Kal va'Chomer (since Bigdei Lavan are even more Kadosh [they are used to go Lif'nim] they certainly require Kidush).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Bigdei Zahav have the strength that they are used for much more Kaparah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the D'rashah of Rebbi is the source for the Tevilah when going from Zahav to Lavan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How, according to Rebbi, do we know Tevilah when going from Lavan to Zahav?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Kal va'Chomer (the reverse of the above).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Bigdei Lavan have the strength...?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is why Rebbi cited an additional Pasuk in the Beraisa (3.d. above) to connect all Bigdei Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>(After citing 3.e.,f.,and g., above, the Gemara asks on g.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Pasuk of "u'Fashat ve'Rachatz" speaks of Tevilah (not Kidush)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not needed for Tevilah and so it is transferred to Kidush.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then the Pasuk should use the language of Kidush?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that the Kidush must also be ba'Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence will R. Yehudah learn Kidush (since he uses "u'Fashat ve'Rachatz" for Tevilos)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the D'rashah of R. Elazar b. Ya'akov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chidsa):</span> Rebbi (who holds that the Kidushin are both while disrobed) disagrees with both R. Meir (the second Kidush is while already robed) and Rabanan (the first Kidush is while still robed).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Acha b. Ya'akov):</span> No, all agree that the second Kidush is while already robed, since the Pasuk instructs that there be nothing to do after the Kidush other than the Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Acha b. Rava):</span> R. Chisda and R. Acha b. Ya'akov must disagree, since together they would end up with 15 Kidushin.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE (PARTIAL) SHECHITAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is 'Kartzo'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means slaughter, as proved from the Targum of R. Yosef on the Pasuk in Yirmeyahu [46:20].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much is needed for Kartzo?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The majority to two Simanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan said this, as well.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It appears that Resh Lakish would also agree (the extra discussion in the Mishnah in Chulin teaches that it is sufficient if the Kohen only slaughters the majority to two Simanim, even if another Kohen does not complete [Meirak] the cutting).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could we have <i>thought</i> that another Kohen <i>must</i> complete the cutting, since that would make it an Avodah, which only the Kohen Gadol can do?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Resh Lakish only meant to consider the possibility that without Meirak it would be Pasul mide'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is not Pasul at all, then why do it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Meirak is a Mitzvah (Lechatchilah).</p></div>
