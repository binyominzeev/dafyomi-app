<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Seven days before Yom Kippur we segregate the Kohen Gadol.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A substitute Kohen is designated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> A substitute wife is also designated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> There would then be no limit.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PREPARING THE KOHEN FOR THE PARAH ADUMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Seven days prior to the burning of the Parah Adumah we segregate the Kohen who will burn it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>He is brought to the Lishkah in the Northeast corner facing the Birah, called the Lishkas Beis ha'Even.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it called that?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because the activities there were conducted in utensils which cannot become Tamei, such as stone.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this stringency needed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Owing to the leniency of T'vul Yom.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learnt that this leniency became a point of contention with the Tzedukim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>As such, we would make the Kohen Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This stringency (of the utensils) was instituted to prevent the Parah Adumah from being treated lightly.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was the Northeast selected?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Chatas (so the Parah is called) is in the North and P'nei Ohel Moed brings us to the East (thus alerting the Kohen to aspects of his upcoming Avodah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Birah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> A place on Har ha'Bayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The entire Mikdash is called Birah (based on the Pasuk).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SOURCE FOR SEGREGATING THE KOHEN GADOL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for a seven day separation?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is learned from the seven days of Miluim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"La'asos" refers to the Parah Adumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Lechaper" refers to the Avodah of Yom ha'Kipurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Given that the Pasuk cannot be entirely referring to Parah Adumah; but may it not all refer to Yom ha'Kipurim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Gezeirah Shavah of "Tzivah-Tzivah".</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But perhaps the connection is only to Yom ha'Kipurim, not to Parah at all?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Tzivah" before the performance is the more reliable connection (over a different Tzivah <i>after</i> its Avodah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we connect to the Tzivah of communal offerings (and the Kohen must separate seven days prior).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Tzivah" does not match "Tzavoso".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find that topical connections <i>are</i> used?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only where no identical word connection is to be found.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "Lechaper" refers not to the Avodah of Yom ha'Kipurim but to all Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We would not know which Kohen it will be.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should require segregation of the entire Beis Av!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more logical to connect to Yom ha'Kipurim whose time/date is fixed (unlike daily Korbanos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then connect to the Korbanos of the Regalim!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more logical to connect with that which takes place once a year.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then perhaps we should choose one Regel!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However we would not know which.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Pesach has the advantage of being first in the Parshah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Sukos has the most Mitzvos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Connect a seven day separation for a one day Avodah with another of the same (not seven for seven).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then connect to Shemini Atzeres (seven for one)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Connect to that which does not have Kedushah preceding it (Yom ha'Kipurim) and not to that which does.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But one which does should all the more so require segregation!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(v)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Hazeh teaches that only a similar day requires segregation.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(w)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Shemini Atzeres (the Tafel) could not require more than the (Ikar) Regel itself!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even according to the opinion that Shemini Atzeres is a separate Regel, that is only regarding <b>PEZER KESHEV</b>.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Regarding Tashlumin, however, Shemini Atzeres still serves Sukos (as we have learned in the Mishnah).</p></div>
