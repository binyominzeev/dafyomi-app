<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ESCORTING THE USHER OF THE SA'IR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The prominent Jews would escort the usher to the first booth en route to Azazel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>There were ten booths from Yerushalayim to Azazel (90 Ris @ 7.5 Ris per Mil).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>At each booth he was offered food or drink in the event that the fast was too difficult for him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The residents of each booth would escort him to the next booth and the last would watch him proceed to the cliff.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>At the cliff the usher would divide a red thread, tying half to a stone and half between the horns of the Sa'ir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>He would push the Sa'ir backward where it would break up on the rocks of the cliff, long before it landed at the bottom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>He would return to the last Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> His garments would be Tamei from his departure from Yerushalayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> From the point of pushing the Sa'ir.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE TEN SUKOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> There were 10 Sukos over 12 Mil distance from Yerushalayim to the cliff.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> Nine Sukos over 10 Mil.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> Five Sukos over 10 Mil, each employing an Eruv Techumin to escort him the entire distance.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi reported that his son, Elazar, lightheartedly indicated that, based on his father's reasoning, he could make do with two Sukos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana who holds that the residents of the last Sukah would (have to) stand and watch him from their distance?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Meir (10 Sukos over 12 Mil).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>OFFERING FOOD AND DRINK</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that the offer of food was never accepted, but the usher benefited from its being available.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is called 'Pas be'Salo' (lit. bread in his basket).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE RED THREAD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why divide the thread at all; let him tie it all to the rock?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> For fear that it may turn white right away and (in his joy) he will neglect his mission (pushing off the Sa'ir).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then tie it all onto the Sa'ir?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps the Sa'ir will fall such that its horns will be concealed from view.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that the thread was once hung publicly and would cause the people's mood to change based on whether or not the thread turned white.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>They instituted that it would be tied to the rock, out of public view (R. Elazar ha'Kapar reported similarly).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>DERIVING HANAAH FROM THE BROKEN PARTS OF THE SAIR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is such benefit permitted?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a dispute between Rav and Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">67b----------------------------------------67b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Heter can be derived from the Hefker implications of the extra word "ba'Midbar".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Isur could be derived from the stringency implied by Gezeirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the Isur opinion, what is the role of "ba'Midbar"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that the Sa'ir ha'Mishtale'ach is done even when the Ohel Mo'ed has been replaced with Mishkan and Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What will the Heter opinion do with the word "Gezeirah"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that the cliff must be jagged.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> It refers to the quality of the Sa'ir as that which breaks apart as it falls.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> It is a decree (Gezeirah) from Hash-m, even if its Kaparah is unfathomable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Mutar position seems logical since, otherwise, the Torah has given an instruction which could lead to a great stumbling (if someone unwittingly benefited from those found parts of the Sa'ir).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>THE PLACE OF AZAZEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>As its name implies, it is doubly harsh ('Az' and 'El').</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>"ba'Midbar' teaches that it may not be in a place of residence.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>"Gezeirah" teaches that it is a cliff.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Another Beraisa teaches that it is the harshest of mountains (proof text).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana d'vei R. Yishmael):</span> The name Azazel alludes to its atonement for Uza and Aza'el (Arayos, -Rashi).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that "Es Mishpatei Ta'asu" refers to Mitzvos which are logical; while "Es Chukosei Tishmeru" is Hash-m's demand of fidelity regarding that which is mysterious and which the Satan claims is meaningless (including the Sa'ir ha'Mishtale'ach).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>TUM'AS BEGADIM OF THE MISHTALE'ACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The usher himself contracts <i>Tum'as</i> Begadim but not his escorts (or the Kohen Gadol) who accompany him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Beraisa negates the possibilities that his <i>Tum'as</i> Begadim began directly upon leaving the Azarah or only once he arrives at the cliff.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> The <i>Tum'ah</i> begins once he leaves the walls of Yerushalayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> Once he arrives at the cliff.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> Once he pushes it over the cliff.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE AVODAH AFTER SENDING THE SA'IR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>He removed the Eimurim from the Par and Sa'ir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>He placed the Eimurim in a Meigis and brought them onto the Mizbe'ach as a Kaparah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>He braided the two animals on top of one another and four people carried them out, whole, to be burnt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> <i>Tum'as</i> Begadim (for the ones dealing with the burning) begins upon leaving the Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> From the moment the fire takes hold of the majority of the Par and Sa'ir.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>BRINGING THE EIMURIM ONTO THE MIZBEACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the Mishnah really mean that he does the Haktarah now (given that there are many Avodos between removing the Eimurim and putting them on the Mizbe'ach)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that he placed them in the Meigis <i>in order</i> to (later) offer them as a Ketores.</p></div>
