<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WASHING HANDS AND FEET UPON ENTERING THE MIKDASH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why wash the hands as well?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This implies a Mitzvah to wipe off (with the hands) the drops from one's legs (so as to prevent his being thought of as a K'rus Shafchah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Excrement in its place prohibits a person from saying Sh'ma.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Under what circumstances are we speaking?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it is visible, the Halachah is obvious.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If it is not visible, we are not angels!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The prohibition applies when it is visible when seated, and not when standing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is this law different from Tzo'ah on his body?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Huna:</span> If there is Tzo'ah on his body or his hands are in the privy it is permitted to recite Sh'ma.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chisda:</span> It is prohibited.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tzo'ah in its place is more malodorous.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ONE WHO STEPS AWAY FROM A MEAL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One who leaves the table to urinate need only wash the soiled hand (from wiping drops off his leg).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he tarried away from the table a long time, he must wash both hands before returning to the table.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>He should wash inside, lest he be suspected of not washing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Shamash would make a point of his having washed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> The requirement to wash inside is restricted to where he will only be drinking at the table.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If, however, he will continue eating, then he may wash outside (since all know that a person is careful not to eat with dirty hands).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Nachman b. Yitzhok added that all know that <i>he</i> is especially careful, and he could even wash outside for drinking.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MISHNAH: TEVILAH BEFORE ENTERING THE MIKDASH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One may not enter the Azarah [to perform Avodah] without prior immersion (even if he is Tahor).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Kohen Gadol immersed five times and washed his hands/ feet 10 ten times.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>All of the immersions were in the Kodesh (above the Beis ha'Parvah) except the first, upon entry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>When the Kohen Gadol immersed a sheet of linen was held up for modesty.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE RATIONALE FOR THE ENTRY IMMERSION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should a Tahor person immerse himself?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ben Zoma):</span> It is a Kal va'Chomer from the Kohen Gadol on Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah):</span> It is a Chumrah to prompt the person to recall that he might be Tamei (and forbidden to enter).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is their dispute?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">30b----------------------------------------30b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Whether (Ben Zoma) or not (R. Yehudah) his Avodah would be invalidated if he did not immerse.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we have a Beraisa teaching that only the omission of the hand/feet makes Avodah Pesulah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the immersion would not invalidate, rather they are arguing whether (Ben Zoma) or not (R. Yehudah) there is an Asei to immerse before entering in the morning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we have a Beraisa teaching that, according to R. Yehudah (dealing with the Metzora), one need <i>not</i> immerse prior to the Avodah of the thumbs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As stated clearly in the Beraisa, R. Yehudah relies on the immersion from the previous evening.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was this Beraisa even introduced?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer and Question:</span> It is introduced because it contradicts another Beraisa which implies that, according to R. Yehudah, the Metzora <i>must</i> immerse before his Avodah (the Beraisa says that the Lishkah was not <i>only</i> for Metzoraim)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One Beraisa is speaking where he <i>did</i> immerse the previous evening, and one where he did not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But if he did not immerse, he requires waiting until nightfall (and he does his Avodah the next day)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, one Beraisa speaks where he was Masi'ach Da'as, and one where he was not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But if he was Masi'ach Da'as, then he requires a new sprinkling on the third and seventh days!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, one Beraisa speaks where he immersed the previous evening intending to come into the Mikdash, the other speaks where he did not have that intention.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> The Beraisa does not have the word '<i>only'</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> R. Yehudah was speaking within the opinion of the Rabanan, with whom he argues, saying that <i>everyone</i> and not only the Metzora should require Tevilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p>The Rabanan do not accept R. Yehudah's contention, since the Metzora, unlike others, is used to being Tamei and a special Tevilah is required lest he had not been careful.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do the Chachamim here (differ from the Chachamim in the first Beraisa and) follow the opinion of Ben Zoma (and here they require all to immerse) and they spoke of the Metzora only to highlight the opinion of R. Yehudah; or is the Metzora just different?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They hold the Metzora is different since he is so used to being Tamei.</p></div>
