<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>BENEFIT FROM BIGDEI KEHUNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The permission to use the garments as a pillow should, itself, prove that benefit is permitted!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Papa):</span> They did not actually place them <i>under</i> their heads, but near them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Mesharshia):</span> This Din could be extended to permit leaving one's Tefilin alongside a sleeping person.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>It appears that R. Papa is correct, since understanding <i>under</i> their heads literally would introduce the problem of Sha'atnez (the Avnet being made of wool and linen).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The opinion which maintains that the Avnet is, indeed, made of both wool and linen would have no reading of the Mishnah in Tamid (<i>under</i> their heads).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This opinion maintains that the Avnet of a regular Kohen is unlike the Avnet of the Kohen Gadol.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This is unlike the opinion which maintains that the Avnet of a regular Kohen is identical with the all- linen Avnet of the Kohen Gadol, for whom the Mishnah presents no difficulty.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Sha'anez is only a problem when worn, not when used as a pillow?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both from the concern of the Chachamim and from R. Shimon b. Pazi we know that it is prohibited, even with any number of protective separations between the Sha'atnez and the person.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>We may, indeed, infer like R. Papa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Ashi maintains that they placed the Avnet <i>under</i> their heads.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What about the Sh'aatnez problem?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Bigdei Kehunah were stiff and thus not subject to the Isur of wearing Sh'aatnez, as supported by the Din of R. Huna b. R. Yehoshua regarding stiff garments.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see clearly from the Beraisa that benefit is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that it is permitted to wear the Bigdei Kehunah for non-Avodah purposes in the Mikdash (and is only prohibited outside out of respect).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we hear of Shimon ha'Tzadik wearing Bigdei Kehunah outside (in the reported incident wherein he appeared thus before Alexander)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Those may have been not actual Bigdei Kehunah, but garments fitting for a Kohen Gadol.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> This was an emergency ("Eis La'asos la'Shem").</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HONOR TO A STUDENT IN HIS MASTER'S PRESENCE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The honor bestowed on the S'gan and Rosh ha'Keneses seems to imply that we honor a student in the presence of his Rav!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> There is no indication from there, since the entire procedure was done in honor of the Kohen Gadol.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE KOHEN GADOL STOOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are we to infer that previously he was sitting?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">69b----------------------------------------69b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>That seems unlikely since nobody excepting a Davidic King may sit in the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is supported by the Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The sitting was in the Ezras Nashim, as R. Chisda taught.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where did R. Chisda teach that it was in the Ezras Nashim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He taught this in conjunction with the Beraisa which says that the Keri'ah was in the Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer b. Ya'akov says it was in the Azarah (citing a Pasuk in Nechemyah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Chisda teaches that it was in the Ezras Nashim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>We continue to interpret the word "Gadol" in the Pasuk in Nechemyah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>EZRA AND THE GREAT NAME</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is "Gadol" in the Pasuk, "Ezra blessed Hash-m Elokim ha'Gadol"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosef citing Rav):</span> Ezra exalted Hash-m employing the Shem ha'Meforash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Gidel):</span> Ezra exalted the Name by instituting the refrain at the conclusion of each Berachah, "Baruch Hash-m ... ".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it was the Shem ha'Meforash?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Shem ha'Meforash is not uttered outside the Azarah (where Ezra was then standing).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find that Ezra <i>did</i> utter the Name outside (as R. Gidal himself taught on the Pasuk in Nechemyah 9)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was an emergency, as extensively reported, they successfully cried out for the Yetzer Harah for idolatry to be given over to their hands.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>After this success, they attempted to do the same with the Yetzer for licentiousness.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Though they were successful in having the Yetzer given over to their hands, they discovered that the world could not exist without its (positive) force, and its force could not be divided.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Thus they blinded it and freed it, thus eliminating its push to incest.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>In Eretz Yisrael the word "Gadol" was interpreted by R. Masna that Ezra exalted the Name with saying 'ha'E-l ha'Gadol... '</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>This supports the words of R. Yehoshua b. Levi, who taught that the Anshei Kneses ha'Gedolah earned that great name because they restored the praise of Hash-m which had been removed by Yirmiyah and Daniel during the destruction and exile.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>They asserted that the very oppression of the Jews and their endurance amidst the nations is the greatest testimony to His Gevurah and Nora'os.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could Yirmiyah and Daniel uproot the institution of Moshe to praise Hash-m in this Manner?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Knowing that Hash-m is Truth, they did not falsify before Him.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>SKIPPING IN READING THE PARSHIOS OF ACHAREI MOS AND ACH BE'ASOR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is a contradiction from the Mishnah in Megilah which says that one may not skip in Keri'as ha'Torah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A <i>short</i> skip (in which there is sufficient time to move to the next spot while the Turgeman is still reciting the Targum) is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa teaches there that the short skip only applies to Nevi'im, and that no skip in the Torah is permitted!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> When the skip maintains one topic it is permitted (as supported by the cited Beraisa).</p></div>
