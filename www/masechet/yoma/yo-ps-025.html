<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>PROPER ATTIRE FOR A PAYIS (cont'd)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Nachman reported his source that the Payis is done in Bigdei Chol.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah teaches that the attendants removed all but the Michnasayim of the Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We assume that these Kohanim are the ones who won.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The changing, then, is <i>into</i> Bigdei Kodesh, <i>from</i> Bigdei Chol!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Sheishes):</span> No, the attendants removed the garments of those who <i>lost</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is supported by the fact that they left on the Michnasayim, which must be the first garments to be donned.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If we were speaking of the winning Kohanim, then the Michnasayim would then be donned <i>last</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman):</span> No, the attendants put Michnesei Kodesh on the winners first, then removed the rest of their Bigdei Chol, leaving them with Michnasayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Sheishes reported his source that the Payis is done in Bigdei Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that the overseer of the lottery removed the <i>Mitznefes</i> from the head of the starting Kohen, a garment only appearing in Bigdei Kodesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>No, there were Kohanim who wore a Mitznefes Chol.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE LISHKAS HAGAZIS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The Lishkas ha'Gazis must have been half in Kodesh and half in Chol.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The sitting elder indicates that there must have been a part in Chol.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Pasuk "be'Vais Elokim... " indicates that the Payis must have been in Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Also, it must have had an entrance to both Kodesh and Chol.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since its entrance determines the status of the room, it must have had an entrance to Chol, since he sat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Payis indicates that it had an entrance to Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE SECOND PAYIS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Mishnah lists the 13 tasks which the second lottery assigned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Ben Azai (citing R. Yehoshua) argues over the order in which the parts of the Tamid were brought onto the Kevesh.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>A PAYIS FOR EACH TASK, OR A COLLECTIVE PAYIS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Was a Payis conducted for each of the 13 tasks, or was one Payis conducted and the tasks were automatically assigned from that one?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We have been taught that there were a total of four.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>No, that they <i>entered</i> four times for Paysos (but perhaps they had many Paysos once they entered).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">25b----------------------------------------25b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>From the Beraisa regarding the Ketores and Machtah in the third Payis we see that there were only four, and the other tasks were automatically assigned to the Kohen to his right.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>No, that was unique to the Ketores and Machtah (but our 13 would involve separate Paysos).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Alternately, the sequence began with the inference that other Avodos (than Ketores and Machtah) required a separate Payis, since these were singled out</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>No, they were singled out because we might have (incorrectly) made two Paysos for them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>In the end, a clear Beraisa teaches that the other 12 assignments were automatic after the first Payis.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>WHO DOES THE KABALAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is the Shochet also the Mekabel, or is the Zorek?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Zorek might rush the Kabalah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Shochet might be a Zar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The 12 spigots of Ben Katin teach us that it is the Zorek who is the Mekabel (R. Acha cites a supporting Beraisa).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>DIFFERING ORDERS FOR HAKRAVAS HATAMID</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Tana Kama teaches the order of its <i>Hiluch</i> (cited by Ben Azai in the name of R. Yehoshua).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yosi teaches the order of its <i>Hefshet</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Akiva teaches the order of the <i>Nituach</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yosi ha'Gelili teaches the order of its <i>Ilui</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But from the Pasuk we learn that the Yerech is <i>more</i> valuable than the Kasef?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That speaks of a lean animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Tana Kama and R. Yosi ha'Gelili agree regarding the priority of value, and only argue as to whether size (Tana Kama) or fat (R. Yosi ha'Gelili) is valued more.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do all the Tanaim agree that the right hind leg goes together with the head.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It, like the head, has many bones.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the head is first?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk puts the Rosh and Pader first to "ve'Arach".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Pader need to be singled out?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was placed over the Beis ha'Shechitah for Kavod.</p></div>
