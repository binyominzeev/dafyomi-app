<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE TERUMAS HADESHEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>It was originally done by whoever came forward.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>In the event that there were several who wished to do it, they would race to the four Amos for the right.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>In the event of a tie, there was a Payis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They would put out one or two fingers.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The thumb could not be put out in the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>When a Kohen was injured in such a race, they were Mesaken that the allocation would always be through a Payis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This was the first of four Paysos.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHY THE PAYIS WAS INSTITUTED ONLY AFTER THE INCIDENT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why wasn't this Payis originally instituted?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They assumed that the night work would not be popular (and when it turned out to be so, even to the point of injury, they instituted the Payis).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Eivarim and Pedarim are at night, yet there was always a Payis?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It ends the Avodah of the day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Terumas ha'Deshen is the start of the days' Avodah (R. Yochanan taught that the Kohen need not be Mekadesh his hands and feet for the days' Avodah once he did so for the Terumas ha'Deshen)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He meant that he has already been Mekadesh for Avodah (but the Terumas ha'Deshen is a separate Avodah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> They originally assumed that sleep would prevent the Kohanim from coming (and when it turned out...).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Eivarim also involve sleep?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Putting off sleep is not as hard as waking up.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But there was a different reason for the Payis, since the same Payis granted the right to Sidur and Eitzim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There were two Takanos:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It was assumed that the Kohanim would not come (for the reasons above) and when it turned out...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Once they made the Payis the Kohanim stopped coming, so they added the right to Sidur and Eitzim to that Payis.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHICH FOUR AMOS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> The four Amos must be those closest to the Mizbe'ach (by inference they could not have been:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>on the ground before the ramp;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>the first four Amos of the Kevesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>the middle Amos of the Kevesh.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did these four Amos include the two Amos above the Sovevim, or were they in addition to them?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Teiku.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE PAYIS AND THE PROHIBITION OF COUNTING JEWS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Payis was announced by the instruction to take out fingers.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not count the Kohanim themselves?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This supports R. Yitzhok who taught that counting Jews is forbidden, as it says by Shaul that he counted the soldiers by using shards (Bezek).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Maybe Bezek refers to the name of the place?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the source is the fact that he later counted them using lambs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Counting Jews is a violation of one (R. Elazar) or two (R. Nachman b. Yitzhok) prohibitions (proof text).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>HOW MANY JEWS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is a contradiction, where one Pasuk refers to the Jews as finite (as the sand of the sea) and one where they are infinite (uncountable).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It depends on whether (infinite) or not (finite) the Jews perform Hash-m's will.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It depends on whether people (infinite) or Hash-m (finite) is doing the counting.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>LEADERSHIP BRINGS WEALTH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>From the example of Shaul (who first gave them shards and later gave lambs) we learn that one who is appointed over the community becomes wealthy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps each soldier had to bring his own lamb?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That would not have been newsworthy.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>SHAUL AND DAVID</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The words va'Yarev ba'Nachal allude to Shaul's rebellion regarding killing all the Amaleikim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Bas Kol said, "Al Tehi Tzadik Harbeh".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>When Shaul told Doeg to kill the Kohanei Nov, the Bas Kol announced, "Al Tirsha Harbeh".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>There is a great difference between Shaul (who was punished for one error- Agag) and David (who was pardoned for two- Uriah and the counting).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What of the incident of Bas Sheva?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was punished fourfold (as he had predicted by his response to Noson) with the son, Amnon, Tamar and Avshalom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But he was also punished for the counting!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was not on his person (it was on the people).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the punishments for Bas Sheva were similarly not on his person?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They were on his person, as he became a Metzora, and was distanced by the Shechinah and the Sanhedrin (as in his pleas in the proof text).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But David received Lashon Hara and caused the splitting of the property of Mefiboshes (another transgression)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> No, he did not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> He did, and he was punished by the splitting of the Kingdom under Yeravam and Rechavam.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>From the Pasuk we see that Shaul was like a one-year-old, untainted by sin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Nachman b. Yitzhok):</span> Maybe he was soiled like a one-year-old in Tit and Tzoah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Nachman b. Yitzhok was shown terrifying angels.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He responded with acknowledging his error in speaking against the bones of Shaul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He was again shown the terrifying angels.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>He responded by adding, 'King of Israel'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was Shaul's reign not passed on to his son?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because his lineage was unblemished.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We are taught that a leader must have such a blemish in his family history.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This keeps the ruler humble.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was Shaul punished?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because he waived his honor (two incidents) at the start of his rule.</p></div>
