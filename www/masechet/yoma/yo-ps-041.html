<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>SPECIFYING A KORBAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> Kinin can only be differentiated by Lekichah or Asiyah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimi b. Ashi):</span> The rationale of R. Chisda derives from the words in the Pesukim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa (cited at the bottom of 40b) teaches that the Goral, not the Name, makes the Kedushah (but the Name should not have been under consideration since it is neither Lekichah or Asiyah)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Kal va'Chomer of the Beraisa is understood to include the factor of Asiyah and Lekichah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learn in a Beraisa (regarding the Korban Chatas of a poor person) that there is Keviyah at times other than Lekichah or Asiyah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa must be amended to read that he became wealthy <i>after</i> setting aside the funds, which is akin to Lekichah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What about the position of R. Chaga (citing R. Yoshiyah) that Bedi'eved the newly-wealthy person <i>is</i> Yotze with the Korban Ani (the designation is neither at a time of Lekichah nor of Asiyah)?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">41b----------------------------------------41b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa should be understood to mean he then took the birds and said...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could he and add to the value of the birds, as we know that there is no Pidyon by birds?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means adding to the <i>remaining</i> funds.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He had only purchased one bird (which becomes a Nedavah)  with part of the money designated for Olah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>He must bring new funds for the Chatas, however, and the one bird already bought as a Chatas must be killed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we have a Beraisa which says that a wealthy Metzora who brings the Korban of an Ani is <i>not</i> Yotze?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Metzora is unique given the word "Zos".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then it should not work for an Ani who brings the Korban of an Ashir either?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah so indicates by the word "Toras" (as found in the supporting Beraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then learn from Metzora to Tamei Mikdash?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah restricts the rules of Metzora, allowing that elsewhere the Ashir may be able to bring the Korban Ani.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MISHNAH: VIDUI OF THE SA'IR HAMISHTALE'ACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A scarlet thread was tied between its horns and it stood by the gate of its departure.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Sa'ir la'Shem was by its Beis ha'Shechitah (see Gemara).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Kohen recited the Vidui for the Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The people respond to the Shem with 'Baruch Shem'.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MARKING THE SA'IR LASHEM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the Mishnah mean that the Sa'ir la'Shem was also tied with a string (around its neck) or also stood in its place (to be slaughtered)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the Beraisa (which gives the reason as to prevent mixing this animal with others) we come to understand that it means a string was also tied (around its neck) since standing it near the place of Shechitah would not prevent it from being mixed with others.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>TWO SCARLET THREADS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzhok):</span> I have learned about the scarlet threads on the Parah Adumah and on the Sa'ir ha'Mishtale'ach, and I do not know which one requires a minimum Shiur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosef):</span> The fact that the thread on the Sa'ir ha'Mishtale'ach must be cut in half indicates that it is the one requiring a minimum Shiur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the thread on the Parah must have heft?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The requirement of Koved is a Machlokes Tana'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> But it seems from the Beraisa that the thread of the Parah must be cut, since it refers to the Sheyarei Lashon?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That means the narrowing end (like the tail).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanin citing Rav):</span> If the flame caught the thread it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa teaches that if the thread was singed it must be replaced with another?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One speaks of a standing flame, which burnt the thread at a distance from its source, where R. Chanin spoke of a bent flame, which burnt it within the flame.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Rava cites his source that the requirement of Koved is a Machlokes Tanaim (Rebbi and R. Elazar b. R. Shimon)._</p></div>
