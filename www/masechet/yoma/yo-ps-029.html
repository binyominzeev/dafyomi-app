<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rebbi's source (to differentiate between the rays of the sun and those of the moon).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ayeles ha'Shachar- the sun diffuses like the horns of an Ayil.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The shape of her womb endears her to her husband.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Esther compared to the morning?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The morning terminates the night, and Esther is the terminus of miracles.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Then Ayeles teaches the comparison between the Tefilos of Tzadikim and the branching horns of the Ayal.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE ERROR IN MISTAKING THE MOON FOR THE SUN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When did this error take place?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was during the year, then why did they then immerse the Kohen Gadol?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it was on Yom Kipur, there is no visible moon at pre-dawn during that time of the month?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was during the year, and the immersion of the Kohen Gadol is a separate clause (after the call of Barkai).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SHECHITAS HATAMID AND OTHER NIGHTTIME ERRORS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Avuhah b'R. Avin):</span> Along with the Shechitas ha'Tamid (which causes the Tamid to be burnt) there are Melikas ha'Of and Kemitzas ha'Minchah).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">29b----------------------------------------29b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But why not just put the Kemitzah back in (if it was removed too early) and re-take it during daylight?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A K'li Shares sanctifies that which comes into it, even at the wrong time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa teaches that [only] that which is to be offered by day becomes Kadosh by day (but not at night)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps the Beraisa only speaks of becoming Kadosh to be offered, but it would still be Kadosh for Pesul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But how come the Lechem (placed after Shabbos, and may not be removed until the second Shabbos) does not become Pasul through having been placed at the wrong time?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> That is a good question, and must be dealt with in light of the fact that Avuhah d'R. Avin was citing a Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that night is <i>not</i> deemed as a Mechusar Z'man, while day <i>is</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Thus placing the Lechem ha'Panim during the <i>day</i> before Shabbos will not allow it to have any Kedushah at all.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But then it will become Kadosh/Pasul once night falls!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is speaking where he took the Lechem off the Shulchan Erev Shabbos and replaced it in the morning.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> If one arranges the Lechem at the wrong time it is a meaningless act (like a monkey) and it thus will not become Kadosh/Pasul.</p></div>
