<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>LISHKAS HATELAIM - R. ELAZAR B. YA'AKOV?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>We find R. Elazar b. Ya'akov in the Mishnah in Midos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Three of the four Lishakos are identified.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Elazar b. Ya'akov said that he did not recall the use of the fourth Lishkah, thus indicating that he was the author of the Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Aba Shaul identified the 'unidentified' Lishkah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>There is another indication that the Mishnah in Midos is R. Elazar b. Ya'akov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>All the walls were tall except for the Eastern wall.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This was to allow the Kohen burning the Parah to see through the opening to the Heichal during the Haza'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>All the gates were 20 Amos tall, with wall above them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>By calculating the elevations of each level, we can see that the Eastern wall, if left at its 20-plus Amos of height, would block his view, and was thus shortened.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>This is only true if the measurements are being given by R. Elazar b. Ya'akov, not the Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Ada b. Ahavah entertains the possibility that the measurements were those of R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah had taught the positioning of the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Mishnah in Midos teaches the overall dimensions of the Azarah (187 x 135 Amos).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If the Mishnah in Midos were R. Yehudah, the Mizbe'ach would not be in the middle, but slightly to the South.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The difficulty involved in such a possibility establishes the Mishnah as the teaching of R. Elazar b. Ya'akov.</p></div>
