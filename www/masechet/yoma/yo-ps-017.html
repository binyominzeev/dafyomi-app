<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE CONTRADICTORY LOCATIONS OF THE LISHKAS HATELAIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Ada b. R. Yitzhok resolved the contradiction by explaining that the Lishkah was very long and appeared differently to one who might enter from the two directions.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>He also taught that it is further likely that the Lishkah was primarily in the <b>SW</b>.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is an apparent contradiction between Mishnayos regarding the Lechem ha'Panim.</p></div>

<div class="bbbline">17b----------------------------------------17b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>By positioning the Lishkas ha'Telaim at the <b>SW</b>, its position coincides with the resolution of the Mishnayos regarding the Lechem ha'Panim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can we identify the position of the Lishkah from the left, given that we always turn to the right?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is not a turning; it is only a calculation of a location.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE KOHEN GADOL GOING FIRST</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>He offers first by selecting which Korbanos he will offer.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>He takes one (of two) Chalos on Shavuos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>He takes four or five Chalos from the weekly Lechem ha'Panim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Rebbi taught that he always takes five, representing half.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah ends up switching authors in the middle!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">First clause:</span> His taking one (of two) Chalos- Rebbi.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Third clause:</span> He takes five- Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first and second clauses are Rabanan (who hold he takes less than half) but they also concur that we don't give the Kohen Gadol broken loaves (hence one of two loaves on Shavuos).</p></div>
