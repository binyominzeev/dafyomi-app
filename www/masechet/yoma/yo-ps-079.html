<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>QUESTIONS ABOUT MEASUREMENTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> Do we calculate the Koseves with or without its seed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ashi):</span> Do we calculate a Se'orah (an <i>"Etzem"</i> for <i>Tum'as</i> Meis) with or without its shell?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Also, are we speaking of a moist or dry Se'orah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Ashi relies on 'ha'Gasah' to address the question of R. Papa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Papa relies on the word 'Se'orah' as opposed to Oshlah (which is a Se'orah without its shell) and as opposed to Shiboles (which is moist Se'orah) to address R. Ashi's questions.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE KOSEVES IS LARGER THAN A KEBEITZAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah citing R. Yehudah):</span> The Koseves ha'Gasah (of our Mishnah) is larger than a Beitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chazal understood that a Koseves is the minimum amount required for one to feel satisfied.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The violation of Yom Kipur occurs when one loses the <i>Inuy</i> of not eating, not when one actually eats (which would be a k'Zayis).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> From the incident in the Mishnah in Sukah we see that <i>two</i> Kosavos are <i>less</i> than a k'Beitzah, such that it seems unlikely that <i>one</i>, even plump, Koseves with its pit could be <i>larger</i> than a k'Beitzah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Food was brought on Sukos to R. Yochanan b. Zakai and two Kosavos and a pitcher of water were brought to R. Gamliel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In both instances, the Tana instructed them to bring the food to the Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Beraisa reports that this was not required, but was their Chumrah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>When R. Tzadok was given less than a k'Beitzah of bread he allowed three leniencies (including eating it outside the Sukah) but if it was a k'Beitzah, it would require a Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Thus it seems that the two Kosavos brought to R. Gamliel were smaller than a k'Beitzah!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">79b----------------------------------------79b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmiyah):</span> Indeed, two Kosavos without their pits are less than a k'Beitzah, while one plump Koseves with its pit is larger (the volume of the pit is greater than the meat, as R. Papa reported the common knowledge that the pits comprise a bit more than 50% of the bushel).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Actually two Kosavos are larger than a k'Beitzah, but fruit never requires Sukah, and that is why they need not have brought it into the Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we learned in the Beraisa that any Achilas K'va requires Sukah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rebbi reported that when learning under R. Elazar b. Shamua they were brought figs and grapes and they ate them Achilas Arai outside of the Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We may infer from this that Achilas K'va (even of the fruit) would have necessitated the Sukah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi meant that they ate even a large amount in an Arai fashion outside of the Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> There was a large quantity of fruit and they ate bread outside of the Sukah Achilas Arai, as well.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>The Beraisa seems to support Rava's assertion:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The 14 meals of Sukos may be filled in with Targima (dessert).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If fruit could fill in, then the Beraisa should have mentioned fruit (thus indicating that fruit does not require Sukah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>No, the word 'Targima' could also mean fruit dessert!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Alternately, the Beraisa was speaking in a place where fruits were not common, and thus used a dessert which does not imply fruit, with no intention to exclude fruit.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE KOSEVES IS SMALLER THAN A KEBEITZAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zvid):</span> The Koseves ha'Gasah of our Mishnah is smaller than a k'Beitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is supported by the manner in which the position of Beis Shamai is taught in the Mishnah in Beitzah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Shamai say that the Shiur Chiyuv of Se'or is a k'Zayis and of Chametz is a ke'Koseves.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Their source for differentiating is the fact that the Torah writes the Isur by "Se'or", as well, even though it could logically be derived from Chametz (since Se'or is a more potent form of Chametz) as similarly being a k'Zayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Now if a ke'Koseves was larger than a k'Beitzah, then Beis Shamai, when looking for a larger Shiur for k'Zayis, would have first come upon k'Beitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Even if they (Koseves and Beitzah) were the same size, k'Beitzah is far more familiar and would have been used!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>We may thus infer that a ke'Koseves is smaller than a k'Beitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps a standard Koseves is indeed smaller than a Beitzah, but a Koseves <i>ha'Gasah</i> is larger!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (still R. Z'vid):</span> Rather, my proof is from the Mishnah in Berachos where a <i>k'Beitzah</i> is listed as satisfying.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>For Zimun the participants need to have eaten a k'Zayis according to R. Meir and a k'Beitzah according to R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah holds that the Pasuk teaches that for Birkas ha'Mazon the food must fulfil "ve'Sava'ta", which is a k'Beitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If a k'Beitzah is satisfying, surely it is enough to remove the sense of <i>Inuy</i> required for the prohibition on Yom Kipur!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Thus we see that a Koseves ha'Gasah must be smaller than a k'Beitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>To summarize, k'Beitzah satisfies (for the purposes of Birkas ha'Mazon) while a ke'Koseves settles the mind of the eater, invoking the prohibition on Yom Kipur.</p></div>
