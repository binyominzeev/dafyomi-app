<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MEZUZOS IN THE GATES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that any gate which leads to a residence (such as the Nikanor Gate leading to Lishkas Parhadrin) must have a Mezuzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This could not be the opinion of R. Yehudah, since the Lishkah itself is, according to him, only a Gezeirah, making the Gate a Gezeirah li'Gezeirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He could view it as one inclusive Gezeirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that all gates require Mezuzos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why were Mezuzos not put on the gates of Mechuza?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Those gates were only to support the structures above them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that should require that they have Mezuzos!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that a Beis ha'Keneses does not ordinarily require a Mezuzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If there is a residence within for the Chazan, then the building <i>does</i> require a Mezuzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, they did not put up Mezuzos for fear of the dangers involved, as reported in the incident in Tzipori.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Sheluchei Mitzvah Einan Nizokin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is not where danger is ever-present, as in the incident of Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PLACE MEZUZOS ON YOUR HOMES - BEISECHA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>This excludes places which are not for human residence.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Others obligate such places but exclude places such as outhouses, bathhouses and places of women's adornments.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Kehana explains the opinions above:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Tana Kama derives the obligation from Beisecha; and the others assume the obligation and derive the exclusions.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Women adorn means they bathe there.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then that is the same as Merchatz?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both public and private bathes are thus mentioned (as we might have obligated the latter).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yehudah explains the opinions above:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Tana Kama understands Beisecha as restricted to full, personal residence, and excludes any other place, even if it is <i>also</i> used for people, such as if women adorn themselves there.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Others consider the combined places to be obligated, but exempt the storehouses (used <i>only</i> as such).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Unseemly places (outhouses, etc.) are exempt even if women also adorn themselves there.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can R. Yehudah claim that an ordinary storehouse would be exempt according to all opinions, when a Beraisa shows that Tana'im hold that they are Chayav!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, this is a Tiyuvta.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE ARCHED GATE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Six gates which are exempt... and here are seven of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The one, the arched gate, is a Machlokes R. Meir (who obligates) and the Chachamim (who exempt) [however they agree to obligate if the frame rises 10 Tefachim before the arch].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Abaye explains that there is no dispute when Chokekin would not give us 10 Tefachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Machlokes is whether (R. Meir) or not (Chachamim) we hold Chokekin Lehashlim to obligate in Mezuzah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>OTHER OBLIGATED BUILDINGS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A Beis ha'Keneses, a woman's home and a home of partners are obligated in Mezuzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> These are <i>obviously</i> obligated?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Beisecha" could be understood in the singular.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Maybe they are, indeed, exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All who need long life are obligated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then what is implied by the singular "Beisecha"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To teach the obligation on the right side.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Another Beraisa teaches that these same three buildings are subject to the laws to Nega'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Again, this is obvious!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the singular male lo I might have learned exemptions.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Maybe, indeed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All homes which are part of the inheritance are included.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is implied by the singular lo?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That the cause for the Nega is miserliness.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But a Beraisa teaches that a Beis ha'Keneses is <i>not</i> subject to the laws of Nega'im?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One Beraisa (which subjects a synagogue to the laws) is R. Meir, and the other (which exempts) is Rabanan (as indicated by R. Meir's opinion obligating it in a Mezuzah even without a residence within).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> They are both the opinion of Rabanan; one speaking where there is an apartment within and one without.</p></div>
