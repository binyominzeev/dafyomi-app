<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>This is explained by the Mashal of Tana Bei R. Yishmael (a merchant wishes to measure the spices, but lets the buyer measure his own unrefined oil).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>They also taught that an Aveirah stops up one's heart (proof text).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One who sullies himself a bit, is sullied a great deal; one who is sullied below is sullied above; sullied in this world, carries over to the next.</p></div>
