<p class="dedicationbox">YOMA 43 (18 Teves) - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>"ve'Lakach Elazar ha'Kohen... " to bring the Avodah back to Elazar (Shmuel); a second Mi'ut to include a Kohen Hedyot.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>"ve'Lakach ha'Kohen Eitz Erez... " even a Kohen Hedyot (Shmuel); to require a Kohen (Rav).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>"ve'Tamei ha'Kohen..." future Paros require Bigdei Kehunah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the one who requires a Kohen Gadol for future Paros, need we be told this elementary requirement?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes, the Torah may spell out that which could be derived logically.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>"ve'Asaf Ish Tahor...ve'Hiniach... Ish" - to permit a Zar; Tahor- to permit a woman; "ve'Hini'ach" - He who has Da'as Lehani'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah cites a Machlokes regarding whether a Katan and a woman may be Mekadesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> A Katan may and a woman may not.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> A woman may and a Katan may not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the rationale for the Rabanan?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk links Aseifah to Kidush.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What will R. Yehudah do with that link?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The plural "ve'Lakchu" comes to include the Katan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence does R. Yehudah exclude a woman?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The masculine form of "ve'Nasan".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will the Rabanan understand this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "ve'Lakchu" and "ve'Nasan" teach the proper number of Kohanim to be involved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>"ve'Lakach Eizov...Ish" - excludes a woman and Tahor to include a Katan (Rabanan); "Ish"- to exclude a Kohen and "Tahor" to include a woman (R. Yehudah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa teaches that a woman is excluded and R. Yehudah does not argue there?!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">43b----------------------------------------43b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since we were taught that all of the Pesukim either maintain the previous position or rectify it, he must argue (since he cannot be maintaining).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>"ve'Hizah ha'Tahor al ha'Tamei..."  "ha'Tahor" implies one who would otherwise be considered Tamei (a T'vul Yom).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>No consistent pattern could be found in the Pesukim (rather some are Motze Miyad and some are Mekayem).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SHECHITAH B'ZAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A Tana taught that a Parah may not be slaughtered by a Zar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yochanan discarded that teaching (and even that of his own Rebbi) and insisted that <i>all</i> Shechitah may be done by a Zar.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SECOND VIDUI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he mention others (e.g. the Kohanim) in his first Vidui?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is proper for a Zakai to atone for a Chayav.</p></div>
