<p class="dedicationbox">SHEVUOS 47 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PEOPLE WHO CANNOT SWEAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one of them was a gambler...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must these cases be taught?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The previous cases were disqualified mid'Oraisa. These cases are disqualified only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If both parties were disqualified...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rava):</span> What is the correct text of the Mishnah? (Some versions switch the opinions of R. Meir and R. Yosi.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rava):</span> What is the Halachah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> I do not know. (The following implies that Rav Nachman later resolved these questions.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (to Question #1 - Rav Yosef bar Minyomi citing Rav Nachman):</span> R. Yosi says, they divide (the disputed money);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, Rav Zevid bar Oshaya taught a Beraisa that says so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Zevid - Beraisa - R. Oshaya):</span> R. Yosi says that they divide. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to Question #2 - Rav Yosef bar Minyomi):</span> A case occurred in which Rav Nachman ruled that they divide.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The oath returns to its place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To where does it return?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami):</span> Our teachers in Bavel say that it returns to Sinai (i.e. Hash-m will punish the guilty party for transgressing the oath on Sinai, which included the Isur to steal. Beis Din does not force the defendant to do anything);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Our teachers in Eretz Yisrael say that it returns to the defendant. (Since he cannot swear, he must pay.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> 'Our teachers in Bavel' refers to Rav and Shmuel. The following shows that they say that it returns to Sinai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Similarly, orphans collect only after swearing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> From whom do they (need to swear in order to) collect?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is from (Shimon,) the one who borrowed from their father (Reuven).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Reuven could have collected without swearing. Why must his orphans swear?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, they must swear in order to collect from Shimon's orphans.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rav and Shmuel):</span> This is only if Reuven died before Shimon. However, if Shimon died first, Reuven could not have collected from the orphans without swearing that he was not paid;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One does not inherit (a claim to) money that his father could have collected only through swearing. (Rashi - since the orphans do not know whether the loan was paid, they cannot swear.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> 'Our teachers in Eretz Yisrael' refers to R. Aba. The following shows that he says that it returns to the defendant.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One witness testified in front of R. Ami that Reuven grabbed an ingot from Shimon. Reuven said 'yes, I grabbed it. It is mine!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Ami):</span> What is the law? We cannot obligate Reuven without two witnesses. We cannot totally exempt him, for there is one witness!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He must swear to contradict the witness.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Rejection:</span> He cannot contradict him, for he admits that he took it, nor is he believed to say 'Shimon was holding <i>my</i> ingot.' He is unable to swear (in this case), just like a thief (is never believed to swear).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Rejection:</span> Since he admits that he took it, and we assume that it was Shimon's (for Shimon was holding it), Reuven is like a thief (who is not believed to swear).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> He must swear, but he cannot, therefore he must pay.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ORPHANS WHO DO NOT SWEAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A Beraisa supports R. Aba.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami - Beraisa):</span> "Shevu'as Hash-m Tihyeh Bein Sheneihem" (an oath decides the dispute between the two parties,) not between their heirs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Reuven says 'your father owed my father 100', and Shimon says 'he owed 50.'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Since Shimon is certain, he swears just like his father would have sworn!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Reuven says 'your father owed my father 100', and Shimon says 'I know that he owed 50. I do not know whether he owed more.'</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">47b----------------------------------------47b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Shimon must swear in such a case (and since he is unsure, he cannot, so he must pay), we understand why a verse is needed to exempt his heirs;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>However, if Shimon would be exempt in such a case, why do we need a verse to exempt his heirs?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Rav and Shmuel learn from "Shevu'as Hash-m Tihyeh Bein Sheneihem"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They learn like Shimon ben Tarfon expounds;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Shimon ben Tarfon):</span> "Shevu'as Hash-m Tihyeh Bein Sheneihem" teaches that (the punishment for) the oath is on both parties.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We can read "Lo Sin'af" like 'Lo San'if', i.e. do not be an agent to bring others to sexual immorality.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Va'TeRaGNu v'Ohaleichem" - TaRtem v'GiNisem (you toured (Eretz Yisrael, i.e. sent spies) and debased Eretz Yisrael, Hash-m's abode (Ri mi'Gash; Maharsha - you debased Hash-m, who put His Ohel (the Divine Presence, in the Mishkan) amidst you.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"Ad ha'Nahar ha'Gadol Nehar Peras" - if one touches someone anointed (with oil), the oil comes on him. (The Peras river was the smallest of the four rivers in Gan Eden, but it is called the big river because it is a border of Eretz Yisrael);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael says, also the slave of a king is called a king.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN ONE SIDE IS SURELY LYING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A grocer swears based on his ledger...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rebbi):</span> There is no reason for everyone (the grocer and the workers) to swear!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya - Mishnah):</span> (There is a need.) Both swear and collect from the employer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did Rebbi accept this answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> The workers swear to the grocer (that he did not pay them, and the grocer does not collect from the employer. This shows that Rebbi did not accept the answer.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> (Really, he accepted the answer.) The Beraisa means, the workers swear <i>to the employer in front of</i> the grocer. Since the grocer knows the truth, perhaps they will be embarrassed to swear falsely in front of him. (Also the grocer swears and collects.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If two pairs of witnesses contradict each other, either pair may testify (by itself) in another case. (We do not know which pair is lying. When in doubt, we follow the Chazakah. They are valid witnesses.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Since we do not know which are lying, we do not accept testimony from either pair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If each pair signed on a different loan document, the law is as follows.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the lenders and borrowers in the documents are different, Rav Huna and Rav Chisda argue like above (Rav Huna honors the documents, and Rav Chisda invalidates them);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If both documents are for the same lender and borrower, all agree that the lender collects the smaller loan. (One document is valid. We do not know which, therefore he collects the smaller);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If Reuven borrowed from two different lenders, (according to Rav Chisda, both documents are invalid. According to Rav Huna) this is just like our Mishnah (even though one party is certainly lying, since the employer does not know which, he must pay both. Here also, Reuven does not know which document is invalid, so he must pay both);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Shimon lent to two different borrowers, (according to Rav Chisda, both documents are invalid;) according to Rav Huna, what is the law? (Since one is invalid, neither borrower need pay. Or, do we consider this like two separate cases, and he collects both?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
