<p class="dedicationbox">SHEVUOS 44 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A MASHKON (SECURITY) THAT WAS LOST (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> When the security was worth as much as the loan, both Tana'im disagree with Shmuel. They discuss a security worth as much as the loan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Tana'im argue about R. Yitzchak's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> A lender acquires a security - "u'Lecha Tihyeh Tzedakah";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he did not acquire it, returning it (when the borrower needs it) would not be called Tzedakah (since it belongs to the borrower).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Akiva holds like R. Yitzchak (therefore, he is liable for losing the security), and R. Eliezer does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yitzchak said his law only regarding a security taken after the loan (which the verse discusses), but not a security taken at the time of the loan!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Rather, if the security was taken after the loan, all agree to R. Yitzchak's law. The Tana'im argue about a security taken at the time of the loan. The law of guarding such a security is the same as that of an Aveidah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> A Shomer Aveidah is a Shomer Chinam;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">44b----------------------------------------44b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> He is considered to be a Shomer Sachar (Rashi - because he is rewarded for doing a Mitzvah; Tosfos - because he is exempt from giving Tzedakah while taking care of the object).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav Yosef must admit that R. Eliezer and R. Akiva argue about his law of an Aveidah (R. Akiva agrees to it, and R. Eliezer disagrees)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, both can agree to his law. They argue about a lender who needs (to use) the security;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Eliezer says, he acts for his own benefit, so this is not considered a Mitzvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Akiva says, since he pays for his usage, this is still considered a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The following Tana'im argue about Shmuel's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> If Reuven lent Shimon, and took a security at the time of the loan, and Shemitah came; even if the security is only worth half the loan, the loan is not cancelled;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi says, if the security is worth the entire loan, the loan is not cancelled. If not, it is cancelled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel said 'it is not cancelled.' What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The value of the security is not cancelled.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That would imply that Rebbi holds that even that is cancelled. If so, why did he take a security?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, R. Shimon says that the entire loan is not cancelled. Rebbi says that the value of the loan above the security is cancelled.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Shimon holds that a security acquires fully. Rebbi holds that it acquires only according to its value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Really, R. Shimon means that the value of the security is not cancelled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Rebbi holds that even that is cancelled. Why did he take a security?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a remembrance of the loan.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OATHS TAKEN TO RECEIVE PAYMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When one must swear mid'Oraisa, it is to avoid paying. The following people take a Rabbinic oath and collect: a worker, a Nigzal (victim of theft), a Nechbal (one who was wounded), one who claims from a defendant who is disqualified from swearing, and a grocer swearing about his ledger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The case of a worker is that Reuven claims (on the day he worked) that he was not paid, and Shimon (the employer) says 'I paid you';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven swears that he was not paid, and collects.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, Reuven swears and collects only if Shimon partially admits, e.g. Reuven claims wages of 50 Dinarim and Shimon admits to 25.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The case of a Nigzal is that witnesses testify that Levi entered Yehudah's house without permission to take a security. Yehudah says 'you took my Kelim', and Levi denies this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yehudah swears how much was taken, and collects.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yehudah says, he swears and collects only if Levi partially admits, e.g. Yehudah claims that two Kelim were taken and Levi admits to one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The case of a Nechbal is that witnesses testify that Levi was unbruised when he entered Yehudah's house, and he left bruised. Levi says, 'you wounded me', and Yehudah denies this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Levi swears that Yehudah wounded him, and collects the damages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Yehudah says, he swears and collects only if Yehudah partially admits, e.g. Levi claims that he wounded him twice and Yehudah admits to once.</p>
