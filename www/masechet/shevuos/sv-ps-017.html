<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE DELAY FOR WHICH ONE IS LIABLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If Reuven (became Tamei and) delayed leaving the Mikdash less than the time for Hishtachava'ah (Tosfos - but at least the time needed to leave the Azarah and re-enter), is he lashed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does the time for Hishtachava'ah apply only to the obligation to bring a Korban, but not to lashes?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does it apply to anyone who became Tamei in the Mikdash, both regarding a Korban and lashes?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If Reuven (became Tamei and) suspended himself in the air above the Azarah, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does the time for Hishtachava'ah apply only to one who could bow (but one who could not bow is exempt)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does it apply to anyone Tamei in the Mikdash, whether or not he can bow?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> If Reuven b'Mezid became Tamei in the Mikdash, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does the time for Hishtachava'ah apply only to one who became Tamei through Ones (but if he b'Mezid became Tamei, he is liable even if he delays less than this)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does it apply to anyone Tamei in the Mikdash, whether he became Tamei through Ones or not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> If a Nazir in a cemetery delays leaving less than the time for Hishtachava'ah, is he lashed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Was the time for Hishtachava'ah taught only regarding the Mikdash?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does it apply to anyone who became Tamei through Ones, in the Mikdash or outside?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE SHORTEST PATH OUT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he did not leave on the shortest path, he is liable. If he left on the shortest path, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If he left on the shortest path, he is exempt, even if he walked heel to toe, even if he took the entire day to leave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If he intermittently pauses and walks, do the delays join up?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously, from Rava's previous law, the delays do not join up!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, there he did not delay, rather he was continuously walking very slowly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If he ran out on a longer path, in the same amount of time as if he walked normally on the shortest path, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does the Torah allot a time for him (what he would need walking normally on the shortest path), and he is exempt if he leaves in this time?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, is he always liable for taking a longer path, and always exempt if he takes the shortest path?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> He is liable for taking a longer path.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> The law is, a Tamei Kohen who served in the Mikdash is Chayav Misah b'Yedei Shamayim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He did not delay (the time for Hishtachava'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He cannot complete an Avodah in less than this time!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He delayed (the time for Hishtachava'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, he is Chayav Kares (for delaying leaving). This already includes Misah b'Yedei Shamayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If we say that the Torah allots a time for him, and he is exempt if he leaves in this time, we can answer. He did Avodah and ran out, all within the allotted time.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">17b----------------------------------------17b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>However, if he is always liable for a delay (even if he leaves in the time it would normally take), what is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 - Abaye):</span> He left on the shortest path and flipped a fork (and thereby turned over limbs burning on the Altar).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If a non-Kohen flipped a fork, he is Chayav Misah b'Yedei Shamayim (because this is an Avodah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of Rav Huna's law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the limbs would not have been consumed had he not flipped them, obviously he is liable for Avodah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the limbs would have been consumed in any case, he accomplished nothing. Why is he liable?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the limbs would have been consumed anyway, but not as soon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Huna teaches that hastening the Avodah is considered Avodah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ENTERING ABNORMALLY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">R. Oshaya:</span> I want to teach a law, but I fear lest my colleagues object!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I say that if one enters a house with Tzara'as walking backwards, even if he is entirely inside except for his nose, he is not Tamei. "Veha'Ba El ha'Bayis" discusses only entering normally.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>I fear lest my colleagues object that if so, he should be Tahor even if he enters totally!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> That is no objection. If he enters totally, he is Tamei, just like vessels inside become Tamei - "Yitma Kol Asher ba'Bayis"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> One may not eat Kodshei Kodoshim or slaughter Kodshim Kalim on the roofs of the (chambers of the) Azarah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a Tamei person entered the Heichal through the roof, he is exempt. "V'El ha'Mikdash Lo Savo" discusses only entering normally.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WITHDRAWING FROM A NIDAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> This is the Mitzvas Aseh in the Mikdash to which the Korbanos for a mistaken Hora'ah do not apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This connotes that the Tana was discussing when the Korbanos for a mistaken ruling apply!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah is a follow-up to a Mishnah in Horayos:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Beis Din is not liable for a (mistaken) Hora'ah about a Lav or Aseh in the Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One does not bring an Asham Taluy (the Korban for one who is unsure whether or not he must bring a Chatas) for a Lav or Aseh in the Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Din is liable for a Lav or Aseh regarding Nidah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One brings an Asham Taluy for a Lav or Aseh regarding Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Our Tana teaches that this is the Mitzvas Aseh in the Mikdash to which the Korbanos for Hora'ah do not apply. They do apply to the following Mitzvah Aseh of Nidah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If a woman told her husband during relations that she felt a flow of blood that makes her a Nidah, if he withdraws (the Ever) immediately (while it is still in erection), he is Chayav (Kares), because withdrawing is pleasurable, just like entrance.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava citing Rav Huna):</span> If he withdrew immediately he must bring two Korbanos, one for relations with a Nidah, and one for withdrawing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It was shortly before her Veses (the time she normally menstruates).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does her husband know the laws?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Granted, he brings a Korban for relations, for he did not sin b'Mezid. He expected to finish relations before she became Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>However, why does he bring a Korban for withdrawing? He sinned b'Mezid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He does not know the laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why does he bring two Korbanos? (Since he does not know that one may not have relations with her right before her Veses, even when she told him that she became Nidah, he did not realize his sin. His transgression of withdrawing is not a 'new' mistake.) He is like one who unknowingly ate two olives' worth of Chelev. He brings only one Korban!</p>
