<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Shimon's source that goats of the Mo'adim atone for (Tum'ah of the Mikdash or Kodshim) that was not known at the beginning nor at the end?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns like R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina taught;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> It says about the goats of the Mo'adim "<i>u</i>'Se'ir." The extra 'Vov' equates it to the previous matter (the goat of Rosh Chodesh).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like the goat of Rosh Chodesh atones for a matter of Kodshim, also the goats of the Mo'adim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they atone for the same thing as the goat of Rosh Chodesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says about the goat of Rosh Chodesh "Osah" - only the goat bears this sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they atone for the same thing as the outer goat of Yom Kipur!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Achas b'Shanah" teaches that the atonement of the outer goat comes only once a year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What knowledge was there about the Chata'im it atones for?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he knew at the beginning and at the end, he must bring a Korban!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he knew at the beginning but not at the end, the inner goat and Yom Kipur suspend punishment for this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he knew at the end but not at the beginning, the outer goat and Yom Kipur atone for this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that he did not know at the beginning nor at the end.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>R. MEIR'S OPINION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Meir says, all the goats (of Rosh Chodesh, the Mo'adim and Yom Kipur) atone for the same things (a Tamei person who entered the Mikdash or ate Kodshim, or a Tahor person who ate Tamei Kodshim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> What is R. Meir's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chama):</span> It says about the goats of the Mo'adim "<i>u</i>'Se'ir." The extra 'Vov' equates it to the previous matter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We are thinking that (the first is learned from Rosh Chodesh, and) each (other) is learned from the previous one. (Parshas Pinchas lists the Korbanos brought on Rosh Chodesh and the Mo'adim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan taught a general rule, that if matter B was learned from matter A, B can teach about other matters, in all areas of Torah except Kodshim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, everything is learned from one source (we learn each Mo'ed directly from Rosh Chodesh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Regarding Shavu'os and Yom Kipur it says "Se'ir", and not ''u'Se'ir'. How can we learn these?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yonah):</span> Rather, "Eleh Ta'asu la'Shem b'Mo'adeichem" equates all the Mo'adim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rosh Chodesh is not a Mo'ed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, a verse calls it Mo'ed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> "Kara Alai Mo'ed" - Tamuz (when the Meraglim toured Eretz Yisrael) was a full month of 30 days. This caused them to return (after 40 days) before the eve of the ninth of Av.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Meir admits that the inner goat of Yom Kipur does not atone for what these goats atone for, and vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The inner goat of Yom Kipur does not atone for what the others do. "V'Chiper... Achas" teaches that it makes only one atonement;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The others do not atone for what the inner goat atones for. "Achas b'Shanah" teaches that the atonement of the inner goat comes only once a year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> The goats of Rosh Chodesh, the Mo'adim and the outer goat of Yom Kipur atone for a Tamei person who entered the Mikdash or ate Kodshim if he did not know at the beginning (whether or not he later found out), and for a Tahor person who ate Tamei Kodshim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa omits the inner goat, and what it atones for (if he knew at the beginning but not at the end).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>R. SHIMON'S OPINION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> The goat of Rosh Chodesh atones for a Tahor person who ate Tamei Kodshim...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We understand why it does not atone for what the goats of the Mo'adim atone for. "Avon (singular)" connotes that the goat bears only one sin, and not two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't the goats of the Mo'adim atone for what the goat of Rosh Chodesh atones for?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says about the goat of Rosh Chodesh "Osah (it)." Only the goat bears this sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>We understand why the goats of the Mo'adim do not atone for what the outer goat of Yom Kipur atones for. "Achas b'Shanah" teaches that the atonement comes only once a year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't the outer goat atone for what the goats of the Mo'adim do?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Chiper... Achas" teaches that it makes only one atonement.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That verse is written about the inner goat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Milvad Chatas ha'Kipurim" equates the inner and outer goats.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ben Yehudah citing R. Shimon):</span> (The goats of Rosh Chodesh atone for a Tahor person who ate Tamei Kodshim. The goats of the Mo'adim atone for this, and also for Tum'ah (of the Mikdash or Kodshim) that was never known. The outer goat atones for both of these, and also for Tum'ah that is known only at the end.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Presumably, he learns that the goat of Rosh Chodesh does not make the atonement of the goats of the Mo'adim from "Avon". The goat only bears one sin, and not two;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He should likewise say that the goats of the Mo'adim do not atone for what the goat of Rosh Chodesh atones for. "Osah" teaches that only the goat bears this sin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He does not expound "Osah" this way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Presumably, he learns that the goats of the Mo'adim do not make the atonement of the outer goat from "Achas b'Shanah" - the atonement only comes once a year.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He should likewise say that the outer goat does not atone for what the goats of the Mo'adim do. "V'Chiper... Achas" connotes that it makes only one atonement!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He does not expound "v'Chiper... Achas" this way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Presumably, this is because that verse is written about the inner goat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also "Achas b'Shanah" is written about the inner goat, yet he applies it to the outer goat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, he expounds "v'Chiper... Achas";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Chiper... Al Karnosav Achas" teaches that the atonement on its (the inner Altar's) corners makes only one atonement, but the atonement on the outer Altar makes more than one atonement.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DOES KEDUSHAH VANISH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> (Starting in Nisan, Korbanos Tzibur must be bought from the Shekalim collected for the coming year.) When Nisan comes, remaining lambs bought for the Tamid (daily offering) are redeemed Tam (without a blemish).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda):</span> Did the Kedushah vanish? (Why can they be redeemed Tam?!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rabah):</span> How can you argue? A Mishnah teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We redeem extra Ketores (incense) (that was not used before Nisan) on money owed to those who made it. We give the Ketores to the workers, and buy it back using the new Shekalim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> Ketores has only monetary Kedushah, therefore its Kedushah vanishes.</p>
