<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SANCTIFICATION OF KLEI SHARES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The same law applies to one who enters the Azarah, or a (valid) addition...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Simi bar Chiya):</span> "Like (Hash-m) showed (Moshe) the form of the Mikdash and Klei Shares (vessels used in the Mikdash) v'Chen Ta'asu" - for all generations, they must be sanctified (the same way as in Moshe's day).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> All the Klei Shares made in Moshe's day were sanctified through the anointing oil. After Moshe, they are sanctified through usage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Chen Ta'asu" should teach that they must be sanctified like in Moshe's day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Va'Yimshachem va'Ykadesh <i>Osam</i>" - only those Klei Shares were anointed, but not those of later generations.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps those Kelim had to be anointed, but later generations can sanctify them by anointing <i>or</i> by usage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> "Asher Yesharasu Vam ba'Kodesh" teaches that usage sanctifies them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the other verse ("Osam") needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If not for "Osam", one might have thought that future generations sanctify Kelim through anointing (due to "v'Chen Ta'asu" <i>and</i> usage (due to "Asher Yesharasu");</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Osam" teaches that they are not anointed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ADDITIONS TO THE CITY OR THE AZARAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> And with two Todah offerings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Bread of the Todos is used, but not the meat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> We learn from "Shtei Sodos Gedolos."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does "Gedolos" mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is the biggest species that may be brought (bulls).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the verse should explicitly say 'bulls'!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is big animals of whichever species they brought.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is not important in Hash-m's eyes!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It says "Re'ach Nicho'ach" regarding animal offerings, bird offerings and flour-offerings, to teach that Hash-m is equally pleased with a small or big offering, as long as the person intended to please Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to the largest type of Minchah that accompanies a Todah, i.e. Chametz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Menachos that accompany a Todah are made from five Sa'im of Yerushalayim, which equal six Sa'im of when Yisrael were in the wilderness;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>This amount equals two Efos, which is 20 Esronim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Ten Esronim are used for the (10) Chametz loaves, 10 are used (altogether) for the three types of Matzah: loaves, wafers and Matzah that was first scalded with boiling water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> The remainder of a Minchah (after taking the Kometz) is used to be Mekadesh the Azarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It should be like the Kidush of Yerushalayim. Just like we are Mekadesh Yerushalayim with something (Todos) that may be eaten there, we are Mekadesh the Azarah with something that may be eaten in the Azarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We should use Todos. They may be eaten in the Azarah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, just like we are Mekadesh Yerushalayim with something that is disqualified if it leaves Yerushalayim, we are Mekadesh the Azarah with something that is disqualified if it leaves the Azarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should use Chametz, like Kidush of Yerushalayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Menachos are not Chametz!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">15b----------------------------------------15b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should ferment (make Chametz) the remainder of a Minchah and be Mekadesh with it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Lo Se'afeh Chametz Chelkam";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Even the remainder, which the Kohanim eat, may not be baked as Chametz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The two loaves brought on Shavu'os are a Minchah of Chametz!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are never proper to be Mekadesh the Azarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Possibility #1:</span> The Azarah (or addition) was built before Shavu'os, and the Kidush is before Shavu'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The loaves do not get Kedushah (to be disqualified if they leave the Azarah) until the accompanying lambs are slaughtered on Shavu'os!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Possibility #2:</span> The Azarah was built before Shavu'os, and the Kidush is on Shavu'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Kidush must be at the time it is completed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Possibility #3:</span> The building was finished on Shavu'os, and the Kidush is on Shavu'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We may not build the Mikdash on Shabbos or Yom Tov!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Possibility #4:</span> The building was finished the day after Shavu'os, and then we are Mekadesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The loaves are disqualified since they were left overnight.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Possibility #5:</span> The building was virtually finished before Shavu'os, and the last bit was finished right after nightfall after Shavu'os (and then we are Mekadesh).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We may not build the Mikdash at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> "Uv'Yom Hakim Es ha'Mishkan" - the Mikdash may be erected or built only during the day.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SHIRAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> And with singing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> They sing the Shirah of Todah (Tehilim 100), with harps and cymbals, on every corner and every big rock;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>They also sing "Aromimcha..." (the song of inauguration, Tehilim 30) and the song of (Hash-m's protection from) damaging angels (Tehilim 91):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some call this the song of plagues - "v'Nega Lo Yikrav b'Ahalecha";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The first opinion calls it the song of damagers because it says "Yipol mi'Tzidecha Elef."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>They sing from "Yoshev b'Seser Elyon" until "Elyon Samta Me'onecha" (and "b'Varcho Mipenei Avshalom Beno" (Tehilim 3) - Gra deletes this).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yehoshua ben Levi would say these verses before going to sleep at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He himself said that one may not use words of Torah to heal himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One may use words of Torah for protection.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is healing a wound merely "forbidden?"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who whispers (the verse "Kol ha'Machalah... Lo Asim Alecha Ki Ani Hash-m Rofe'echa") over a wound has no share in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan explained that is when he spits first, for we do not mention Hash-m's name after spitting.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>HOW THE LOAVES ARE CARRIED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Beis Din walking, the loaves (after them - Gra deletes this)...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Beis Din walks in front of the loaves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Achareihem Hoshaya va'Chatzi Sarei Yehudah"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah means that Beis Din walks and the loaves are carried;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(The Mishnah did not mean that Beis Din is in front,) the loaves are in front.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How are they carried?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chiya or R. Shimon b'Rebbi):</span> One is beside the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (the other of R. Chiya and R. Shimon b'Rebbi):</span> One is in front of the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The inner loaf is eaten, the outer loaf is burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that one is beside the other, the inner loaf is the one closer to the wall (Rashi - both are outside the wall; Tosfos - they are inside).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to the opinion that one is in front of the other, the inner loaf is the one (in back,) which is closer to Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>According to this latter opinion, we understand why the inner loaf is eaten and the outer loaf is burned. The second loaf was taken on a path already Mekudash by the first loaf (i.e. the first loaf left Yerushalayim, but the second loaf did not).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that one is beside the other, they jointly are Mekadesh the place. They should have the same law!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Also according to the opinion that one is in front of the other, it is difficult. How can the front loaf be Mekadesh without the latter?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>An addition that was not made with everything mentioned in the Mishnah (and two loaves are listed) does not get Kedushah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even like the opinion that an addition made with even only one of the things mentioned in the Mishnah gets Kedushah, the two loaves are one Mitzvah (one loaf by itself does nothing)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> A prophet instructed that the inner loaf is eaten, and the outer loaf is burned.</p>
