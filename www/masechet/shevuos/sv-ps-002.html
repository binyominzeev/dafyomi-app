<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are two primary oaths of Bituy (that one will or will not do something). There are four in all;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>There are two primary Yedi'os (awarenesses) of Tum'ah. There are four in all;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>There are two primary forms of Yetzi'ah (taking things out) on Shabbos. There are four in all;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>There are two primary appearances of Tzara'as. There are four in all.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ATONEMENTS FOR TUM'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If one knew of the Tum'ah, and later forgot (and entered the Mikdash or ate Kodshim), and later remembered that he was Tamei, he brings an Oleh v'Yored Korban (i.e. a rich person brings an animal, a poor person brings birds, and a very poor person brings a flour offering);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he knew of the Tum'ah, and forgot (and entered the Mikdash or ate Kodshim), and did not remember before Yom Kipur, the goat (whose blood is) offered inside (the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim on Yom Kipur) and Yom Kipur itself protect him from punishment;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When he remembers, he must bring an Oleh v'Yored;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he never knew of the Tum'ah (and entered the Mikdash or ate Kodshim), and later was told that he had was Tamei, the goat (whose blood is) offered outside (the Heichal) and Yom Kipur itself atone for him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(When the Torah commands about the outer goat on Yom Kipur, it says "Milvad Chatas ha'Kipurim" to teach that it atones for the same things as the inner goat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like the inner goat atones for Tum'ah that was known at some time, also the outer goat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The goats of the Mo'adim and Rosh Chodesh atone for Tum'ah that was never known.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Shimon says, the goats of the Mo'adim atone for this, but not those of Rosh Chodesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The goats of Rosh Chodesh atone for a Tahor person who ate Tamei Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Meir says, all the goats atone for the same things, i.e. Tum'ah of the Mikdash or Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Recap):</span> R. Shimon says, the goats of Rosh Chodesh atone for a Tahor person who ate Tamei Kodshim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The goats of the Mo'adim atone for Tum'ah that was never known;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The outer goat of Yom Kipur atones for Tum'ah that was known only after he transgressed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabanan):</span> If a goat designated for one of these three atonements was lost, and it was found after a substitute was offered, may the found goat be used for another of the three atonements?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon):</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabanan):</span> If it was originally designated for one atonement, how can it atone for something else?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon):</span> They all atone for (transgressions involving) Tum'ah in the Mikdash or with Kodshim. This is essentially what it was designated for!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ben Yehudah citing R. Shimon):</span> The goats of Rosh Chodesh atone for a Tahor person who ate Tamei Kodshim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The goats of the Mo'adim atone for this, and also for Tum'ah that was never known;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The outer goat of Yom Kipur atones for both of these, and also for Tum'ah that was known only after he transgressed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabanan):</span> If a goat designated for one of these three atonements was lost, and it was found after a substitute was offered, may the found goat be used for another of the three atonements?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon):</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabanan):</span> Indeed, the outer goat of Yom Kipur may be used on Rosh Chodesh, since it was designated to atone for more;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, how can a goat designated for Rosh Chodesh be used on Yom Kipur? It was originally designated to atone for less!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon):</span> They all atone for Tum'ah of the Mikdash or Kodshim. This is essentially what it was designated for!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>The inner goat and Yom Kipur atone for intentional Tum'ah in the Mikdash or with Kodshim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>The goat sent to Azazel (on Yom Kipur) atones for all other transgressions, light or severe, intentional or unintentional, whether or not the person knows he sinned, Lav or Aseh, even what is punishable by Kares or death;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It atones for Yisraelim, Kohanim and a Kohen Gadol anointed (with Shemen ha'Mishchah, special oil from the days of Moshe) alike;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The difference between them is that the bull (of Yom Kipur) atones for the Kohanim for Tum'ah in the Mikdash or with Kodshim (the Gemara will address the contradiction between this and the previous clause);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon says, just like blood of the inner goat atones for Yisrael, so the blood of the bull atones for Kohanim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like the confession said over the goat sent to Azazel atones for Yisrael, so the confession said over the bull atones for Kohanim.</p>
