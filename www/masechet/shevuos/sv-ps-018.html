<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WITHDRAWING FROM A NIDAH (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was not shortly before her Veses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does her husband know the laws?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he does, he should not bring any Korbanos!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He is Ones (blameless) for relations, and he sinned b'Mezid by withdrawing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he does not know the laws, he brings only one Korban!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He is exempt for relations (it was Ones), and he is liable for withdrawing (he was Shogeg).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Really, it was shortly before her Veses. He knows that relations are forbidden then. He does not know that one may not withdraw an erect Ever.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Mishnayos teach the obligation to bring a Korban for relations and withdrawing!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Withdrawing - (Mishnah):</span> If a woman told her husband during relations that she became Nidah, if he withdraws immediately he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Relations - (Mishnah):</span> If a man found blood on the cloth he used to clean his Ever after relations, he and his wife are Teme'im (she is Nidah, and he had relations with a Nidah), and each must bring a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The case is, they had relations shortly before her Veses. They are liable for relations.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ada bar Masnah):</span> No, it was not shortly before her Veses. They are liable for withdrawing. (Noda b'Yehudah - the case is, she told him to withdraw. Chasam Sofer - we could have asked why she is liable, for she is blameless! Rather, we ask a better question below (e).)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should a second Mishnah teach liability for withdrawing?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The latter Mishnah is needed to teach the law when she found blood on the cloth she used to clean herself (shortly but not immediately) after relations;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Then, he is doubtfully Tamei, and they do not bring a Korban (perhaps she became Nidah after relations).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Once it teaches the law when she finds blood on her cloth, it also teaches about when he finds blood on his.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Ada - Ravina):</span> You cannot establish the Mishnah not just before her Veses, and the liability is for withdrawing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says that blood <i>was found</i> on his cloth. This implies that before this, they did not know that she became Nidah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If liability is for withdrawing, they must have known that she became Nidah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Ravina is correct!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ada - Beraisa):</span> This (the case of the Mishnah) is the Mitzvas Aseh of Nidah to which the Korbanos for Hora'ah apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Ravina (they are liable for relations), it should say 'this is the <i>Lav</i>... !</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If there is such a Beraisa, it is abbreviated, and it means as follows. This (the case of the Mishnah) is the Lav of Nidah to which the Korbanos for a mistaken ruling apply;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a woman told her husband during relations that she became Nidah, if he withdraws immediately he is liable. This is the Mitzvas Aseh of Nidah to which the Korbanos for a mistaken ruling apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he withdraws immediately he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What should he do?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> He should stick his toenails in the ground (and not move the Ever) until the erection ceases, then withdraw.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Inference (Rava):</span> We may infer that if one has forbidden relations with a limp Ever, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he would be liable, we would have to say that he is exempt (in our case) because he was Ones;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If so, he would be exempt even if he withdrew immediately!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> Really, if one has forbidden relations with a limp Ever, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One is exempt (in our case) because he was Ones;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He must withdraw with minimal pleasure. If he withdraws immediately, he is liable for getting extra pleasure!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar Chanan):</span> If indeed relations with a limp Ever are considered relations, and there is an exemption for withdrawing later but not immediately, the Mishnah should have taught this along with the exemption for leaving the Mikdash (on the shortest path, and not on a longer one)!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">18b----------------------------------------18b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah did not teach them together because they are contrary to each other!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Mikdash, the exemption is for the shortest path, and not a longer one;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The exemption for withdrawing from a Nidah is if he delays, and not if he withdraws immediately!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> If Abaye exempts him due to Ones, it was not shortly before her Veses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, Abaye said (17b) that he brings two Korbanos. It must have been shortly before her Veses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That teaching of Abaye did not refers to the case of the Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SEPARATION FROM A NIDAH AND BEFORE HER VESES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yonason ben Yosi):</span> What is the Lav forbidding relations with a Nidah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Shimon ben Yosi):</span> Obviously, it is "v'El Ishah b'Nidas Tum'asah Lo Sikrav"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if a woman told her husband during relations that she became Nidah, what forbids him to withdraw immediately?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Chizkiyah):</span> "U'Sehi Nidasah Alav."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is an Aseh. What is the Lav?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> It is "Lo Sikrav" (the above verse);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Lo Sikrav" can also mean 'do not separate', like it says "Kerav Elecha Al Tigash Bi."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yoshiyah):</span> "V'Hizartem... mi'Tum'asam" forbids a man to his wife shortly before her Veses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much in advance must he separate?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> He must separate the night or day (from morning until evening) when she is due to menstruate.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Anyone who does not separate from his wife shortly before her Veses, even if his sons are like Aharon's sons, they will die prematurely;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Right after "v'Hizartem...", it discusses the death of Aharon's sons.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Anyone who separates from his wife shortly before her Veses, he will merit to have sons;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just after "Lehavdil Bein ha'Tamei u'Vein ha'Tahor", it says "v'Yaldah Zachar."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Such a person merits that his children will be qualified to give Halachic rulings - (it says earlier, Vayikra 10:10-11) "Lehavdil... u'Lhoros."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Anyone who makes Havdalah over wine after Shabbos, he will merit to have sons. It says (Vayikra 10:10) "Lehavdil Bein ha'Kodesh u'Vein ha'Chol", similar to "Lehavdil Bein ha'Tamei u'Vein ha'Tahor", which is followed by "v'Yaldah Zachar."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Binyamin bar Yefes):</span> Anyone who has relations modestly, he will merit to have sons. It says "v'Hiskadishtem vi'Hyisem Kedoshim", and (soon afterwards) "v'Yaldah Zachar."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MUST ONE KNOW HOW HE BECAME TAMEI?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> "Sheretz Tamei v'Nelam"...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Akiva agrees that he brings a Korban only if he forgot the Tum'ah. What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chizkiyah):</span> They argue about w	hether or not he must know what made him Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer holds that he brings a Korban only if he knows how he became Tamei, e.g. through a rodent or a Neveilah. R. Akiva holds that it suffices that he knew that he became Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Ula agrees with Chizkiyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ula):</span> Here, R. Eliezer says that he brings a Korban only if he knows how he became Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If one ate Chelev or Nosar (and is unsure which), in either case he must bring a Chatas! Likewise, if he did Melachah on Shabbos or Yom Kipur, or if he had relations with a Nidah (his wife) or his sister (and is unsure which), he brings a Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua says, "Hoda Elav Chataso Asher Chata Bah" teaches that he must know what he transgressed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> Regarding (the Chatas of a commoner), it says "Chata v'Havi" - he brings a Chatas whenever he knows that he sinned (even if he does not know which sin of Kares it was);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Tum'ah, it already said "b'Chol Davar Tamei." "Oh b'Nivlas Sheretz Tamei" is extra!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This teaches that he brings a Korban only if he knows how he became Tamei (through a Sheretz or Neveilah... )</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva argues. Since the verse needed to mention Behemah and Chayah to teach Rebbi's Gezeirah Shavah (to reveal that the verse discusses Tum'ah of the Mikdash or Kodshim), it also mentioned Sheretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> Any Parshah in the Torah that was repeated, it is possible that it teaches only one Chidush (we need not expound every repeated word).</p>
