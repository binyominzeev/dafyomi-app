<p class="dedicationbox">SHEVUOS 42 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THINGS ONE NEED NOT KNOW (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Levi claimed 600 Zuz from Yehudah. Yehudah said 'I paid you with 100 Kavim of gallnuts. Each Kav was worth six Zuz.' Levi said that a Kav was worth four Zuz, and brought witnesses who said so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Yehudah is Huchzak Kafran (therefore, he is not believed to say that he paid the remaining 200 with money).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> You yourself say that anything that is not incumbent on a person (Rashi - Yehudah need not say how he paid; R. Chananel - at the time, the witnesses were not asked to remember the price of gallnuts), he is not mindful about it (therefore, Yehudah is not Huchzak Kafran)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> People remember prices (therefore, he is Huchzak Kafran).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>QUESTIONABLE DOCUMENTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Reuven claimed a Maneh from Shimon, and showed the loan document. Shimon claimed that he paid him. Reuven said 'you paid a different debt, and not the loan of this document.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Reuven's admission that he received money taints the document (Tosfos - he cannot collect with it; R. Chananel - to collect, he must swear that he was not paid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The document is not tainted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Papa, why is this different than the following case (in which the document is tainted)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Levi claimed a Maneh from Yehudah (from a business venture. Yehudah was supposed to buy cattle, slaughter and sell them), and showed the document.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Yehudah:</span> You came to where I was selling, and I paid you!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Levi:</span> You paid a different debt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The document is tainted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, since the money was given to buy cattle, and he was paid where he was selling them, there are grounds to say that he paid that debt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the previous case, we have no such grounds. (Since he did not take back the document, there are grounds to say that it was for a different debt.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Halachah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papi):</span> The document is not tainted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes brei d'Rav Idi):</span> The document is tainted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The Halachah is, the document is tainted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>This is only if he paid in front of witnesses, without mentioning the document. If he paid without witnesses, Migo that Reuven would be believed to say that he was not paid, he is believed to say that he was paid for a different debt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Such a case occurred with Avimi brei d'R. Avahu (Kesuvos 85a).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TRUSTING THE LENDER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Reuven lent money to Shimon. Shimon said, if you will say that I did not pay, I will trust you (i.e. and I will repay you). Shimon brought witnesses who saw him pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye and Rava):</span> Shimon said that he will trust him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> He meant only if the two of them will argue, but he did not trust him against witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Levi lent money to Yehudah. Yehudah said, if you will say that I did not pay, I will trust you like two witnesses. Shimon brought three witnesses who saw him pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Shimon only trusted him like two witnesses, but not like three!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rejection (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> We follow the majority of opinions only regarding estimation (of property value). There, the more opinions, the better the estimate;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding testimony, two witnesses are as good as 100!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rejection (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Regarding testimony, two witnesses are as good as 100!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, if he said 'I will trust you like three witnesses', and Shimon brings four witnesses that saw him pay, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since Shimon specified three witnesses, he showed that he considers more witnesses to be more reliable.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SWEARING TO CHILDREN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One need not swear to deny the claim of a child, lunatic or deaf-mute. We do not make a child swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ki Yiten <i>Ish</i>... money or vessels to guard", but when a child gives, nothing takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do swear to a child and to Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Reisha said that one need not swear to deny the claim of a child, lunatic or deaf-mute!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> We swear if the child claims money that was owed to his father. The Mishnah is R. Eliezer ben Yakov;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> Sometimes, one swears due to his own claim. If Shimon told Reuven 'your father gave me a Maneh, and I returned half to him', Shimon must swear that he owes only half, due to his own claim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim exempt him from swearing, like a Meshiv (one who returns an) Aveidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Eliezer ben Yakov obligate a Meshiv Aveidah to swear?! (Rashi - an enactment exempts him; Tosfos - he is believed that he returned everything, Migo (since) he could have kept it all.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> The case is, a child claims from Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Our Mishnah teaches that we need not swear to deny the claim of a child, lunatic or deaf-mute!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav really means that an adult claims (money of his father) from Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He calls him a child, because one is (ignorant) like a child regarding his father's affairs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the Beraisa, R. Eliezer said 'sometimes one swears due to his own claim.' This is the case of another's claim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is another's claim, but his own admission.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">42b----------------------------------------42b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The oath of partial admission always comes through another's claim, and his own admission! (Why did R. Eliezer says <i>sometimes</i>, and why do Chachamim argue?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 3):</span> Rather, R. Eliezer and Chachamim argue about Rabah's law (Rashi - really, a child claims; Tosfos - an adult claims);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> Why did the Torah say that one who partially admits to a claim must swear?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> There is a Chazakah that one (Shimon) lacks the audacity to deny the claim of his creditor (Reuven) (Rashi - because Reuven helped him; Tosfos - because Reuven would know that Shimon is lying);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Really, Shimon would like to admit to the entire claim. He admits to only part to stall until he can pay it all;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>The Torah imposes this oath on him in order that he will admit to the entire debt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span>R. Eliezer holds that just like one lacks the audacity to deny the claim of Reuven (his creditor), he cannot deny the claim of Reuven's son. Therefore, Shimon is not like a Meshiv Aveidah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span>Chachamim say, he cannot deny Reuven's claim, but he could deny Reuven's son's claim (Rashi - the son did not help Shimon; Tosfos - the son does not know whether the debt was paid);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since he <i>chose</i> to admit, he is like a Meshiv Aveidah, and he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Reisha shows that the Mishnah is not R. Eliezer ben Yakov!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reisha):</span> If Reuven claimed 'you owed my father a Maneh' (and I inherited it), and Shimon admitted that he owed 50, he (pays 50 and) need not swear, for he is like a Meshiv Aveidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, Reuven's claim was uncertain (he does not know whether or not Shimon paid), so Shimon is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (e) - Shmuel):</span> We swear to children and Hekdesh to collect from their property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Another Mishnah already teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who collects from orphans' property must swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The repetition teaches Abaye Kashisha's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye Kashisha - Beraisa):</span> The laws of orphans, i.e. one who collects from orphans' property must swear, and we collect only low quality land from orphans, apply to adult orphans, and all the more so to minors.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Another Mishnah already teaches the law of Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who collects from Meshubadim (property that the debtor sold or gave to someone else) must swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Why should we distinguish whether the property passed to a person or to Hekdesh?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we only swear when a person received it, lest the borrower is scheming with the creditor to improperly take the property from the buyer (e.g. the loan was already paid), but we are not concerned lest one scheme to cheat Hekdesh. The Mishnah teaches that we are concerned even regarding Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Huna taught that if a Shechiv Mera (one who fears lest he die from his illness) made all his property Hekdesh, and said that a Maneh of (what we assumed was) his property belongs to Ploni, he is believed. There is a Chazakah that people do not scheme to cheat Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That applies only to a Shechiv Mera. He would not lie, for he does not stand to benefit from it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We are concerned lest a healthy person scheme with the one who will take the property from Hekdesh (and they will share it).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THINGS WE DO NOT SWEAR ABOUT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not swear about slaves, documents, land and Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The following laws apply to these. A thief does not pay Kefel (double) for them, nor four or five (if he later slaughtered or sold a stolen (Hekdesh) animal), a Shomer Chinam need not swear about them (even through Gilgul), a Shomer Sachar need not pay for them (in fact, all Shomerim are exempt from swearing and paying for them);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon says, one swears about Kodshim that have Achrayus (a Neder, i.e. a vow to bring a Korban. If the animal is disqualified or lost, he must bring another). One does not swear about Kodshim without Achrayus (a Nedavah, an animal that he made a Korban. If the animal is disqualified or lost, he need not bring another.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Meir says, some things are like land, but have the law of Metaltelim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven claimed 'I entrusted you with ten vines laden with grapes', and Shimon said 'you entrusted me with only five', Shimon must swear;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim disagree. Anything connected to land is like land. He need not swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>One must swear only about something with a measure, weight or number:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven claimed 'I entrusted you with a full house or wallet (e.g. of grain or coins) and Shimon said 'I don't know how much it was. Take what is there', he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven claimed 'it was full up to the ledge', and Shimon said 'it was up to the window', he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source that Kefel does not apply to these things?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Al Kol Devar Pesha" is a Klal. "Al Shor Al Chamor Al Seh Al Salmah" are Pratim. "Al Kol Aveidah" is another Klal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>From the Klal u'Frat u'Chlal we learn everything similar to the Pratim, i.e. something that can be moved and has intrinsic value;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We exclude land, for it cannot be moved. We exclude slaves, for the Torah equates them to land. We exclude documents, for they lack intrinsic value. "Re'ehu" (his fellowman) excludes Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Nor four or five...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (The payment of four or five is Kefel, and an added two or three. Since the extra payment of Kefel does not apply, we could only obligate two or three above principal.) The Torah never obligated payment of three (for a Seh) or four (for an ox).</p>
