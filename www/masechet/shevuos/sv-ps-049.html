<p class="dedicationbox">SHEVUOS 49 - Two weeks of study material, including the Siyum of Maseches Shevuos, have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE EXCEPTION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> We are Megalgel from any mid'Rabanan oath, except that of a worker.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> For any mid'Rabanan oath, we are not lenient (for the defendant; rather, one can Megalgel), except for a worker's oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these opinions?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Huna holds that we suggest to the claimant to be Megalgel. Rav Chisda disagrees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Shemitah cancels the obligation to swear (about a claim of money owed from before Shemitah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Gidal):</span> "V'Zeh Devar ha'Shemitah" - even Dibur (an obligation to swear) is cancelled.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SHOMERIM WHO SWORE FALSELY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are four watchmen: a Shomer Chinam, a borrower, a Shomer Sachar, and a renter;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Shomer Chinam swears about any Ones (the deposit was broken, captured, died; lost or stolen), and he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A borrower pays for any Ones to the deposit (except if it died while working, for which he is exempt);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A Shomer Sachar or a renter swears (and is exempt) if the deposit was broken, captured, or died; he must pay if it was lost or stolen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Reuven claimed his deposit from Shimon, a Shomer Chinam. Shimon said that it died (or that any other Ones happened). Really, a different Ones occurred. Reuven imposed this oath on him, and he answered Amen. Shimon is exempt (from the Korban for Shevu'as ha'Pikadon, for he did not deny money, since he is exempt for any Ones);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon denied having ever received the deposit, and really he had received it but an Ones occurred, and he accepted an oath to back up his claim; Shimon is exempt (he did not deny money, for he was exempt anyway);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Shimon claimed that it was lost, and accepted an oath; and witnesses testify that Shimon really ate it, he pays only principal;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Shimon confesses on his own, he pays principal, adds a Chomesh (a quarter of the principal), and brings an Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If Shimon claimed that it was stolen, and accepted an oath; and witnesses testify that Shimon really ate it, he pays double;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Shimon confesses on his own, he pays principal, a Chomesh, and brings an Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Yehudah charged Levi 'you stole my ox!', Shimon denied this, and witnesses testify that Shimon stole it, he pays double;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If witnesses further testify that he slaughtered or sold it, he pays four or five;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Levi saw witnesses coming to Beis Din, and (therefore) admitted to stealing it but denied slaughtering or selling it, (even so) he only pays principal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If Reuven claimed his deposit from Shimon (a borrower), and Shimon said that it died (or that any other Ones happened), and really, a different Ones occurred, and Shimon accepted an oath, he is exempt (for in any case he is liable);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">49b----------------------------------------49b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon denied that he ever received the deposit, and really he had received it, but an Ones occurred, and he accepted an oath; Shimon is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>In the following cases, a Shomer Sachar or renter (Shimon) who swore to the depositer, is exempt (for he did not try to deny money);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shimon said that it died (or another full Ones occurred, i.e. it was broken or captured, so he is exempt), and really, a different full Ones occurred;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shimon claimed a semi-Ones (it was lost or stolen, for which he is liable), and really, the other semi-Ones occurred.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If Shimon claimed a full Ones, (exempting himself), and really a semi-Ones occurred, and he accepted an oath, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If Shimon claimed a semi-Ones, (obligating himself), and really a full Ones occurred, and he accepted an oath, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The general rule is, if by lying he remained liable (as if he told the truth), or he remained exempt, or he obligated himself when he was really exempt, he is exempt for the oath;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If by lying he exempted himself when he was really liable, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The general rule is, if lying decreased his liability, he is liable. If he increased his liability, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah, who says that there are four Shomerim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman citing Rabah bar Avuha):</span> It is R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> All agree that there are four Shomerim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> I meant that R. Meir is the Tana who obligates a renter like a Shomer Sachar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is the opinion of R. Yehudah, and not R. Meir!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A renter is liable like a Shomer Chinam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, he is liable like a Shomer Sachar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah bar Avuha's text of that Beraisa switches the opinions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since a renter is liable like a Shomer Sachar, there are only three Shomerim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> There are four kinds of Shomerim, there are three laws of Shomerim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IS HE LIABLE FOR SHEVU'AS BITUY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven claimed from a Shomer Chinam...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Whenever the Mishnah says 'exempt', he is exempt from Shevu'as ha'Shomerim, but he is liable for Shevu'as Bituy;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> He is exempt even from Bituy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel holds that since the oath does not apply to the future (e.g. to swear that it will be stolen), he is exempt for Bituy;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav holds that since the oath applies in the positive and negative (e.g. it was not stolen), he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> They already argued about this elsewhere!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If Reuven swore that Ploni threw (or did not throw) a stone into the river, he is liable, because the oath applies to the positive and negative;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> He is exempt, for it does not apply to the future (to swear that he will throw).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>They needed to argue in both cases;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had they argued only there, one might have thought that Rav obligates because Reuven himself decided to swear, but he admits that he is exempt if Beis Din forced him to swear, like R. Ami taught;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> One is never liable for Bituy for an oath that Beis Din forced him to take.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had they argued only here, one might have thought that Shmuel exempts because Beis Din forced him to swear, but he admits that he is liable if he himself decided to swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> One is never liable for Bituy for an oath Beis Din forced him to take. "<i>Ki</i> Sishava" connotes that he decided to do so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> 'Ki' has four meanings: if, perhaps, rather, and because. (Here it means if, i.e. if he chooses to swear.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> In all cases, he is liable for Shevu'as Bituy, except for when he is liable for Shevu'as ha'Shomerim, i.e. a borrower who denies that he received the deposit, or a Shomer Sachar or renter who (falsely) claim that a full Ones occurred, for they denied money.</p>
