<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>OTHER WORDINGS OF A SHEVU'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> It says "va'Yavei Oso b'Alah (Nebuchadnetzar imposed an Alah on Chizkiyahu)", and "Asher Hishbi'o bei'Lokim." These teach that Alah is a Shevu'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The expression 'Arur' includes excommunication, curse, and oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Excommunication - "Oru Meroz... Arur Yoshveha (cursed is Meroz... and those who sit near him)";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Barak excommunicated Meroz with 400 shofars.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Curse - "These will stand Al ha'Kelalah... Arur ha'Ish."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Oath - "Va'Yashba Yehoshua... Arur ha'Ish (who will rebuild Yericho)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps he swore <i>and</i> cursed! (So this does not prove that Arur includes an oath!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Rather, we learn from "va'Yo'el... Sha'ul... Arur ha'Ish who will eat... Yonasan did not hear b'Hashbi'a."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps here also, Sha'ul swore and cursed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it would have said 'v'Arur.'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The same can be said regarding Yehoshua, that is also a proof that Arur is an oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> 'Amen' is an expression of (accepting) an oath, accepting terms, and affirmation.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An oath - "v'Amrah ha'Ishah (the Sotah) Amen Amen";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Accepting terms - "cursed is the one who will not fulfill... v'Amar Kol ha'Am Amen."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Affirmation - "Amen Ken Ya'aseh Hash-m (to return the vessels of the Mikdash and Bnei Yisrael from exile)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Saying 'no' or 'yes' is an oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, we learn about 'no' from "v'Lo Yihyeh Od ha'Mayim l'Mabul", and "Asher Nishbati me'Avor Mei Noach";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, what is the source that 'yes' is an oath?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is logical that if 'no' is an oath, also 'yes' is.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It is an oath only if he says 'yes' or 'no' twice;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m said "v'Lo Yikares Kol Basar" <i>and</i> "v'Lo Yihyeh Od ha'Mayim l'Mabul."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Similarly, 'yes' is an oath only if he says it twice.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CURSING WITH THE NAME OF HASH-M</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> One who curses Hash-m with any of these names is liable (to death administered by Beis Din). Chachamim exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir) Question:</span> Since it says "v'Nokev Shem Hash-m Mos Yumas", why must it say also (death regarding) "Ish Ish Ki Yekalel Elokav"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that one is liable only for (cursing) the intrinsic name 'Hashem'. The extra verse obligates also for other names;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim say, one is Chayav Misah for cursing 'Hashem'. One transgresses a Lav for other names.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who curses his parents...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who are Chachamim, who exempt (from death) for cursing parents with other names of Hash-m?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are R. Menachem bar Yosi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Menachem bar Yosi):</span> We do not need "b'Nakvo Shem Yumas" to teach about cursing Hash-m, so we apply it to cursing parents. One is liable only for cursing with the name 'Hashem.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who curses himself or another person with any of these names transgresses a Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> All agree to this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who curses himself transgresses "Hishamer Lecha u'Shmor Nafshecha Me'od";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin):</span> 'Hishamer', 'Pen', or 'Al' always denotes a Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who curses another person transgresses (a Lav learned from a Tzad ha'Shavah of cursing a parent and) "Lo Sekalel Cheresh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> 'Hashem should strike you (if you will not testify for me)' is the Alah (curse) the Torah refers to.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Rav Kahana was reciting this Mishnah in front of Rav Yehudah. Rav Yehudah told him to recite it in the third person (lest it sound like he curses Rav Yehudah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>A Chacham was reciting and expounding "Gam Kel Yitatzecha..." Rav Kahana told him to recite it in the third person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must this case also be mentioned?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we recite only Mishnayos in an altered form, but not verses. The second episode teaches that we do so even with verses.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>AN INFERRED CURSE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If he said 'Hashem should not strike you', 'Hashem should bless you', or 'Hashem should do good to you (if you will testify for me)', they are liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Meir holds that we do not infer the positive from the negative (i.e. He should strike you if you do not testify, and not the negative from the positive)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The opinions of R. Meir and Chachamim must be switched.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yitzchak learned the Mishnah like our (original) text.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> We cannot switch the opinions if this opposes our text and R. Yitzchak's!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we resolve the contradiction in R. Meir?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Meir does not infer the positive from the negative in monetary matters, but for Isurim, he does.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Sotah is an Isur, and R. Tanchum said that R. Meir infers the negative (if you are not innocent, you will die) from the positive (if you are innocent, you will be safe), because it says "Hinaki" without a 'Yud' (we can interchange 'Hei' and 'Ches', and read this 'Chanki', you will choke)';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If not, R. Meir would not infer the negative from the positive!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">36b----------------------------------------36b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Indeed, the opinions must be switched. R. Meir does not infer the negative from the positive even for Isurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> If so, he should exempt one who serves in the Mikdash after drinking wine, or with more than 30 days growth of hair, from Misah b'Yedei Shamayim! (The Torah only says that Kohanim will not drink wine before serving, and they will not die.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who serves in the Mikdash after drinking wine or with more than 30 days growth of hair is punishable by Misah b'Yedei Shamayim. (We do not find that anyone disagrees!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer #2:</span> The opinions must be switched. R. Meir does not infer the negative from the positive for anything involving money. He does infer for Isurim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sotah is an Isur that involves money (the Kesuvah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ritva) Answer #2:</span> Do not switch the opinions. R. Meir does not infer the negative from the positive for anything involving money. He does infer for Isurim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sotah is an Isur involving money. (Shevu'as ha'Edus is considered an Isur not involving money, for the witnesses do not stand to lose or profit.)</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK SHEVU'AS HA'PIKADON</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SHEVU'AS HA'PIKADON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Shevu'as ha'Pikadon applies to men and women, to strangers and relatives, to Kosher and invalid witnesses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When he swears himself, it applies in or outside of Beis Din. If the oath is imposed on him, he is liable only if he denies in Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, whether he swears himself or the oath is imposed on him, he is liable if he denies (even outside of Beis Din).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>He is liable whether or not he knew the punishment for the oath, if he knew that he swears falsely;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is exempt if he believed that he was swearing truthfully.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>When liable, he brings an Asham that costs at least two Shekalim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Shevu'as ha'Pikadon is when Shimon told Levi 'give to me the deposit you are holding for me', and Levi swore 'you do not have a deposit by me', or Shimon imposed this oath on him and he answered Amen. (If Levi was lying,) he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If he imposed the oath on him five times, in or outside of Beis Din, and Levi denied the deposit, he is liable for each oath;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon says, this is because each time he could have admitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If five partners claimed a deposit from Levi, and he swore 'you do not have a deposit by me', he is liable only once;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'I swear that you do not have a deposit by me, nor you... ', he is liable for each one.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer says, he is liable for each only if he said 'Shevu'ah' (Ramban - also) at the end;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon says, he is liable for each only if he said 'Shevu'ah' to each.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If Shimon claimed from Levi 'you have a deposit from me, a loan, theft (an object you stole from me), and an Aveidah (an object I lost)'; and Levi swore 'I have nothing of yours', he is liable only once;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he swore 'I do not have of yours a deposit, loan, theft or Aveidah', he is liable for each one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If Shimon said 'give to me my wheat, barley and spelt', and Levi swore 'I have nothing of yours', he is liable only once;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Levi said 'I swear that I do not have of yours wheat, barley or spelt', he is liable for each one.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir says, even if he said 'wheat, barley and spelt' in the singular forms of these words, he is liable for each one (this will be explained later).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Shimon claimed 'you raped or enticed my daughter', and Levi denied it, and Shimon imposed this oath on him, and Levi answered Amen, Levi is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Shimon exempts, for even if he admitted, he would not pay the fine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> True, but he would pay for embarrassment and Pegam due to his own admission!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>If Shimon said 'you stole my ox', and Levi denied it, and Shimon imposed this oath on him and Levi answered Amen, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Levi admitted 'I stole your ox, but I did not slaughter or sell it', and  Shimon imposed an oath on him and Levi answered Amen, Levi is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>If Shimon said 'your ox killed my ox', and Levi denied it, and Shimon imposed this oath on him and Levi answered Amen, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon said 'your ox killed my (Kena'ani) slave', and Levi denied it, and Shimon imposed this oath on him and Levi answered Amen, Levi is exempt. (He would not pay the fine even if he admitted).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>If Shimon said 'you wounded me', and Levi denied it, and Shimon imposed this oath on him and Levi answered Amen, is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>If Tavi (Levi's Kena'ani slave) said 'you knocked out my tooth or blinded my eye', and Levi denied it, and Tavi imposed this oath on him and Levi answered Amen, Levi is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The general rule is, if the defendant would have had to pay due to his own admission he is liable. If not, he is exempt.</p>
