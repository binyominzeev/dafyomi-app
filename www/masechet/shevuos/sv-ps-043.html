<p class="dedicationbox">SHEVUOS 43 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN A SHOMER IS EXEMPT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Shomer Chinam need not swear about them (even through Gilgul)...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> ""Ki Yiten Ish El Re'ehu" is a Klal. "Kesef Oh Chelim" are Pratim. "Lishmor" is another Klal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>From the Klal u'Frat u'Chlal we learn everything similar to the Pratim, i.e. something that can be moved and has intrinsic value;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We exclude land, for it cannot be moved. We exclude slaves, for the Torah equates them to land. We exclude documents, for they lack intrinsic value. Re'ehu" excludes Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Shomer Sachar need not pay for them...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> ""Ki Yiten Ish El Re'ehu" is a Klal; "Chamor Oh Shor Oh Seh" are Pratim. "V'Chol Behemah" is another Klal;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>From the Klal u'Frat u'Chlal we learn everything similar to the specifics, like above.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Some things are like land, but have the law of Metaltelim...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that R. Meir holds that things connected to land are not like land;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather than argue about laden vines, he should argue with Chachamim about barren trees! (It is a bigger Chidush to teach that they are not like land, for no part of them is destined to be detached.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> They argue about grapes ready to be harvested:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir holds that we consider that they are already harvested; Chachamim disagree.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE CLAIMS MUST BE QUANTIFIED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One must swear only about something with a measure, weight or number...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Shimon is exempt only if Reuven claimed <i>a</i> full house. If he claimed <i>this</i> full house, this quantifies his claim (and Shimon must swear).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If so, why does the Seifa give the case when Reuven claimed up to the ledge and Shimon admitted up to the window?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it should teach a more similar case, i.e. he claimed <i>this</i> full house, and Shimon must swear!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rather, one must swear only if the claim and denial were both about something with a measure, weight or number.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven claimed 'you owe me 30 Sa'im of wheat', and Shimon denied it all, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven claimed a large lamp or belt, and Shimon admitted that he owes a small one, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, if Reuven claimed 30 Sa'im of wheat, and Shimon admitted to owing 15, he is liable. If Reuven claimed a lamp weighing ten Literin, and Shimon admitted that he owes a lamp of five Literin, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The general rule is, one must swear only if the claim and denial were both about something with a measure, weight or number.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does the general rule come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even if he claimed 'this full house', Shimon is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When Reuven claims a large lamp and Shimon admits to a small one, he is exempt. Presumably, this is because the admission is unlike the claim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The same should apply when Reuven claims a lamp weighing ten Literin and Shimon admitted that he owes one of five Literin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> The lamp is composed of rings. A five Liter lamp is part of a ten Liter lamp.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, the Beraisa could have taught a case of a belt in which one is liable, i.e. a belt of loops sewn together (a short belt is part of a long belt)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, we must say that the Beraisa does not discuss belts of loops. Similarly, it does not discuss lamps of rings!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Aba bar Mamal):</span> A five Liter lamp is part of a ten Liter lamp, because the latter can be converted to the former by scraping off some of the metal.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A MASHKON (SECURITY) THAT WAS LOST</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven lent Shimon four Dinarim and took a security, and the security was lost (Reuven is liable for it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven claims that the security was worth two (Dinarim, therefore Shimon still owes two) and Shimon claims that it was worth four, he is exempt (Shimon denies the entire claim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven claims that the security was worth two, and Shimon claims that it was worth three, he must swear (Shimon admits to a Dinar and denies a Dinar);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If Shimon claims that the security was worth eight (so Reuven owes him four), and Reuven claims that it was worth four, he is exempt (Reuven denies the entire claim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If Shimon claims that the security was worth eight, and Reuven claims that it was worth five, he must swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>The one who was watching the security (i.e. Reuven) swears;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Shimon would swear, perhaps Reuven would show the security (Rashi - and prove that Shimon swore falsely about its value, disqualifying Shimon from swearing again; Tosfos - it would turn out that Shimon's oath was not needed, since we later saw the security and we can evaluate it ourselves).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">43b----------------------------------------43b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> To which case does the Seifa (Reuven must swear, lest... ) refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot refer to the last clause taught before this (Shimon claims that the security was worth eight, and Reuven claims that it was worth five). If so, why does it say that Reuven swears, lest Shimon swear and Reuven show the security...? Mid'Oraisa, Reuven must swear!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel, R. Chiya bar Aba, R. Yochanan):</span> It refers to the Reisha.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It refers to the Seifa of the Reisha (the second clause. Reuven claims that it was worth two, Shimon claims that it was worth three. He must swear);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Mid'Oraisa, Shimon swears that it was worth three. Chachamim enacted that instead Reuven swears (lest Shimon swear and then Reuven will show the security).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rav Ashi's law suggests another answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> The Halachah is, Reuven swears that he does not have the security, and Shimon swears how much it was worth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Mishnah means that Reuven swears <i>first</i>, lest Shimon swear first and then Reuven will show the security (to proves that it is not worth as much as Shimon swore that it is).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Levi lent 1000 Zuz to Yehudah, and took a handle (of a shovel, which is not worth even one Zuz) for a security. If he loses the handle, he forfeits the loan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he took two handles for securities, he does not forfeit (even) half the loan if he loses one of them. (If he loses both, he forfeits the loan.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If he took two, he forfeits half the loan if he loses one of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he took a handle and an ingot, he does not forfeit half the loan if he loses the ingot (since the loan can be collected from it, he only deducts its value from the loan).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Neharde'a):</span> Even if he took a handle and an ingot, he forfeits half the loan for losing either one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven claims that the security was worth two, and Shimon claims that it was worth three, he must swear;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since he lost the security, the loan should be forfeited! (This argues with all three opinions above. All agreed with Shmuel when only one security was taken.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Rashi) Answer:</span> In the Mishnah, Reuven stipulated that if he loses the security, he will collect the remainder of the loan. Shmuel's law is when no stipulation was made.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Chananel) Answer:</span> Shmuel's law is when Reuven stipulated that he accepts the security as if it was worth the value of the loan. In the Mishnah there was no stipulation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about Shmuel's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If Reuven lent Shimon and took a security, and lost it, he swears (that he lost it) and collects the debt. (He is only a Shomer Chinam (one who guards a deposit for free. He is liable only for negligence), because the security is not for collection. It is a mere reminder of the loan.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, he lent only due to the security. Now that he lost it, he lost the loan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If there was also a loan document, all agree that it was for collection. He is a Shomer Sachar (one paid to guards a deposit for free. He is liable also for theft or loss), so he lost the loan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the security was worth as much as the loan, R. Eliezer would not argue!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the security was worth less than the loan. R. Akiva holds like Shmuel, and R. Eliezer does not.</p>
