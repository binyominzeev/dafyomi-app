<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>INCLUSIONS AND EXCLUSIONS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> Normally, Rebbi expounds Klal u'Frat. Redemption of a firstborn is different, like Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael taught.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> It says (regarding Simanim of Kosher fish) twice "ba'Mayim" (and afterwards, Pratim). Therefore, we do not expound according to Klal u'Frat, rather, according to Ribuy and Mi'ut.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Chachamim argue with Rebbi about redemption of a firstborn son? (Since the Klalim are adjacent, they should agree that we expound through Ribuy and Mi'ut!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> Chachamim expound like Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> Whenever there are two adjacent Klalim, we put the Pratim in the middle and expound through Klal u'Frat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since Rebbi normally expounds according to Klal u'Frat, surely he holds like R. Yishmael regarding oaths!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, Rebbi taught R. Akiva's opinion regarding oaths, even though he disagrees.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FORGETTING AFTER KNOWING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> "V'Ne'elam... v'Ne'elam" teaches that one brings a Korban only if he knew at the beginning and at the end, and forgot in between (when he transgressed);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rebbi says, "v'Ne'elam" connotes that he knew. "V'Hu Yada" also teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The extra "v'Ne'elam" obligates him, whether he forgot the Tum'ah or the Mikdash (or Kodshim). This is like R. Yishmael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rebbi says that "v'Ne'elam" connotes that he knew. How is this implied?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> It is because it does not say 'it was hidden <i>from him</i>' (which would imply that he never knew).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Abaye):</span> It says about a Sotah "v'Ne'lam me'Einei Ishah." Will you say that he knew and forgot?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Nikah ha'Ish me'Avon and she will bear her sin" - the water tests her only if her husband acted properly. (Tosfos - even if he did not have Bi'ah with her afterwards, forgetting that she became forbidden to him is a gross negligence.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Abaye):</span> Regarding Torah, it says "v'Ne'elmah me'Einei Kol Chai." Will you say that it was once known?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Lo Yada Enosh Erkah" (no person knows its worth)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> Rebbi considers having learned the laws of Tum'ah (Rashi - and having felt the rodent when it touched him, even though he did not reflect and realize that he is Tamei) as having once known. (Had he thought about the Tum'ah, he would have known to avoid transgressing.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa - Mishnah):</span> If he never knew of the Tum'ah (and entered the Mikdash or ate Kodshim), and later was told that he was Tamei...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Surely, any adult once learned the laws of Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The case is, when he was a child, he was captured by Nochrim (and never learned the laws of Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE YETZI'OS OF SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are two primary forms of Yetzi'ah on Shabbos. There are four in all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah (in tractate Shabbos)):</span> There are two primary forms of Yetzi'ah and two secondary forms inside (Rashi - bringing something into a Reshus ha'Yachid; Tosfos - regarding a person standing in a Reshus ha'Yachid);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There are also two primary and two secondary Yetzi'os outside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does our Tana mention only four of the eight?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> There, the focus of the tractate is the laws of Shabbos, so the Tana mentions also the derivative Melachos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Our tractate does not focus on the laws of Shabbos (it is merely brought in passing), so the Tana mentions only the Av Melachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Avos are Yetzi'os. There are only two of them (yet our Mishnah mentions four)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Mishnah mentions Avos that one is liable for, and also those for which one is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Presumably, the Yetzi'os are similar to appearances of Tzara'as, i.e. one is liable for all of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> There, the focus of the tractate is Shabbos, so the Tana mentions Yetzi'os for which one is liable, and for which one is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Our tractate does not focus on the laws of Shabbos, so the Tana mentions only Yetzi'os for which one is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There are only two Yetzi'os for which one is liable for (yet our Mishnah mentions four)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are also two Hachnasos (bringing something into a Reshus ha'Yachid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tana says there are a total of four Yetzi'os!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> Hachnasos are also called Yetzi'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to say this?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> One who is Motzi from one domain to another domain is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This includes taking from a Reshus ha'Rabim to a Reshus ha'Yachid, and the Tana calls it Hotza'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it only refers to taking from a Reshus ha'Yachid to a Reshus ha'Rabim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it should have said 'one who is Motzi from a Reshus ha'Yachid to a Reshus ha'Rabim';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, it says 'from one domain to another domain' to teach both directions;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Any uprooting of an object from its place is called Hotza'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Support (Ravina - Mishnah):</span> There are two primary forms of Yetzi'ah and two secondary forms inside, and two primary and two secondary Yetzi'os outside;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Tana then details the Yetzi'os, and some are Hachnasos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Tana (there) says that there are two domains of Shabbos, which lead to four Isurim inside and four outside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Tana (there) says that (transferring between) domains of Shabbos entails two Isurim for which one is liable (and four in all) inside, and two Isurim of liability and four in all outside.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>PRIMARY APPEARANCES OF TZARA'AS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are two primary appearances of Tzara'as. There are four in all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah (in tractate Nega'im)):</span> There are two primary appearances of Tzara'as. There are four in all. Baheres is as bright as snow. Its secondary appearance is k'Sid (like plaster of) the Heichal. Se'es is like white wool. Its secondary appearance is k'Karom (like the membrane of) an egg.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> This latter Mishnah is not like R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi, Tosfos):</span> R. Akiva says that the different appearances are one above (whiter than) the other. (Different appearances join together to complete the area of plagued skin only if there is not another of the four appearances in between.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the Mishnah were R. Akiva, k'Sid would not join with any appearance!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot join with Baheres, because Baheres is not directly whiter than it (Se'es is in between);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It cannot join with Se'es, because our Mishnah says that it is not a secondary appearance of Se'es! (Tosfos - it teaches precisely this, that it does not join with Se'es; R. Akiva himself holds that it joins to Se'es, even though it is secondary to Baheres. Rashi - R. Akiva holds that k'Sid is secondary to Se'es).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Other versions:</span> Ba'al ha'Ma'or - our Mishnah holds that there are only three different shades of white. Se'es is also k'Sid, but plagues of Se'es and k'Sid have different textures. Ramban - R. Akiva holds that all the appearances are the same shade of white. They vary only in intensity. Gra - R. Chanina holds that R. Akiva says that Se'es is whiter than k'Sid, unlike our Mishnah which puts k'Sid second to Baheres. We explain below only according to Rashi and Tosfos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, also k'Karom would not join with any appearance!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot join with Se'es, because Se'es is not directly whiter than it (k'Sid is in between);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It cannot join with k'Sid, because it is from a different primary appearance than k'Sid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Vela'Se'es vela'Sapachas" teaches that the secondary appearance of Se'es joins with Se'es, even though Se'es is not directly whiter than it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The question from k'Sid remains (if the Mishnah is R. Akiva, and nothing joins with it);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The Mishnah is not R. Akiva.</p>
