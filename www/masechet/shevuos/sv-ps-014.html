<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT ATONES FOR THE KOHANIM? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> The Beraisa can be R. Yehudah. It asked as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that the bull does not atone for them for Tum'ah of the Mikdash or Kodshim, and nothing would atone for them for Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "Yechaper v'Al ha'Kohanim" proves that they get atonement for other transgressions;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since they get atonement for other transgressions, presumably they get atonement also for Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It is more reasonable to say that they get atonement through the Kohen Gadol's bull, for it atones for more than it says. It atones also for "Beiso";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>We do not find that the inner goat atones for more than Yisraelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Alternatively, we can learn from "Beis Aharon Borechu Es Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What forced the Tana to give an alternative answer? How could one challenge the first answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah says (only) "Beiso". Therefore, the Tana shows that all Kohanim are called Beiso.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Above, we learned from "la'Am" that the inner goat does not atone for Kohanim.) We need "la'Am" to teach that the congregation pays for it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is learned from "ume'Es Adas Bnei Yisrael."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Above, we thought to learn from "Asher Lo" that the bull does not atone for Kohanim.) "Asher Lo" is needed to teach the following!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Kohen Gadol pays for the bull himself. The congregation does not pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the congregation does not pay, because it does not atone for them, but Kohanim pay, for it atones for them!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Asher Lo."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Kohanim should not pay, but if they did, it is Kosher!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Another verse repeats "Asher Lo" to teach that even b'Diavad, it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana asked, just like goat of the congregation does not atone for the Kohanim, because they do not pay for it, also the bull should not atone for Kohanim, for also they do not pay for it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He answered that Kohanim are called Beiso.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Shimon, we understand why the Torah teaches about two confessions (over the bull) and the (sprinkling of its) blood. These atone for the Kohanim for the three atonements Yisraelim get from the inner and outer goats and the goat that is sent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, according to R. Yehudah, the goat that is sent atones also for Kohanim. One confession and the blood should suffice!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The extra confession is to atone for himself before he atones for the Kohanim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> It is proper that the one making atonement for others should already have atonement himself.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK YEDI'OS HA'TUM'AH</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>YEDI'OS OF TUM'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are two primary Yedi'os (awarenesses) of Tum'ah. There are four in all:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He knew that he became Tamei, then forgot and knowingly ate Kodshim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He knew that he became Tamei, then forgot (that this meat is) Kodesh and ate it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He forgot the Tum'ah and the Kodesh, and after eating it he found out. In all these cases, he brings an Oleh v'Yored.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He knew that he became Tamei, then forgot and knowingly entered the Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>He knew that he became Tamei, then forgot the (place of the) Mikdash and entered;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>He forgot the Tum'ah and the Mikdash, and after he left he found out. In all these cases, he brings an Oleh v'Yored.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The same law applies to one who enters the Azarah (Chatzer) of the Mikdash, or a (valid) addition to it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>To add onto Yerushalayim or the Azarah, we need a king, a Navi, the Urim v'Tumim, the great Sanhedrin of 71, two of the loaves that accompaniy a Korban Todah, and Shirah. Beis Din must walk (around the addition) , with the loaves after them, and all of Yisrael after them.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The inner loaf is eaten, and the outer loaf is burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If an addition was made without all this, one who enters there (b'Tum'ah) is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one became Tamei in the Azarah, then forgot the Tum'ah but remembered (that he was in) the Azarah; or, if he remembered that he was Tamei, but forgot the Azarah; or, he forgot both:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he bowed (before leaving), or delayed the time needed to bow, or did not leave on the shortest path, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he left on the shortest path, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>This is a Mitzvas Aseh (that he must leave on the shortest path) to which the Korbanos for a mistaken Hora'ah (ruling of the great Sanhedrin which caused most of Yisrael to transgress a Mitzvah involving Kares) do not apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>There is a Mitzvas Aseh regarding Nidah to which the Korbanos for a mistaken Hora'ah do apply:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a woman told her husband during relations that she felt a flow of blood that makes her a Nidah, if he withdraws the Ever (while it is still in erection), he is Chayav Kares, because withdrawing it is pleasurable, just like inserting it. (Rather, he must not withdraw it until the erection ceases.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Eliezer says, "Sheretz Tamei v'Nelam" teaches that he brings a Korban only if he forgot the Tum'ah, but not if he forgot the Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Akiva says, "v'Nelam Mimenu v'Hu Tamei" - he brings a Korban only if he forgot the Tum'ah, but not if he forgot the Mikdash. (The Gemara will explain what they argue about.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yishmael says, it says 'v'Ne'elam' twice, to obligate in both cases, i.e. forgetting the Tum'ah or the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Papa) Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah say that there are four Yedi'os in all? Really there are six!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There is Yedi'ah of the Tum'ah at the beginning and at the end;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>There is Yedi'ah of the Kodesh at the beginning and at the end;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>There is Yedi'ah of the Mikdash at the beginning and at the end!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav Papa say that there are eight cases?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Each of the two Yedi'os of Tum'ah is really two cases, i.e. when he later ate Kodshim, or entered the Mikdash!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both are considered a Yedi'ah of Tum'ah, so we do not distinguish them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Really, there are eight Yedi'os (like suggested above);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> The Tana counts only the four Yedi'os at the end, for these Yedi'os cause him to bring a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> The Tana counts only the four Yedi'os at the beginning, for these are unique to Tum'ah in the Mikdash or with Kodshim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Regarding other Aveiros for which one bring a Korban, one is liable even if he had Yedi'ah only at the end.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IGNORANCE OF THE LAWS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> What is the law if he forgot the laws of Tum'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He does not know which rodents are Metamei and which are not.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Even children learn this. Surely lack of this Yedi'ah does not exempt him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he knows which rodents are Metamei, but he did not know whether a lentil's worth of a rodent is Metamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Is knowing that rodents are Metamei considered Yedi'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, since he did not know whether a lentil's worth is Metamei, it is not Yedi'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If someone from Bavel never knew where the Mikdash is (and entered while Tamei), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to whom does he ask?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He asks according to R. Akiva, who obligates obligates a Korban only if he knew at the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Akiva does not obligate for forgetting the place of the Mikdash!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He asks according to R. Yishmael, who obligates a Korban for forgetting the place of the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yishmael obligates even if he did not know at the beginning! (Surely, he is liable!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He asks according to Rebbi, who obligated a Korban only if he knew at the beginning, and obligates for forgetting the place of the Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rebbi also holds that having once learned is considered Yedi'ah (at the beginning).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Is knowing that there is a Mikdash considered Yedi'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Or, since he did not where it is, it is not Yedi'ah?</p>
