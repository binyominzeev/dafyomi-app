<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>EXEMPTIONS FROM SHEVU'AS HA'EDUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I impose an oath on you if you will not testify that Ploni promised to give to me 200 Zuz, and he did not give to me', they (the witnesses) are exempt (for even if this is true, Ploni need not give);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One is liable only for a claim of money that must be paid, similar to a deposit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said 'I impose an oath on you that you will testify for me after you will see testimony', they are exempt, for the oath preceded (seeing) the testimony.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he said in the Beis ha'Keneses 'I impose an oath on (all of) you, that if you know testimony for me you will testify', they are exempt, (for he did not specify the witnesses);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he said 'I impose an oath on you, Ploni and Almoni, that if you know testimony for me you will testify', and they swore that they do not, and they had heard testimony from another witness, or one of them was a relative or an invalid witness, they are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If Reuven (the claimant) sent his slave to ask the witnesses to testify, or the defendant made them swear, they are exempt, because Reuven did not ask them to testify.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> If he said 'I impose an oath on you if you will not testify that Ploni promised to give to me 200 Zuz, and did not give to me', perhaps they (the witnesses) are liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Secheta-Secheta" teaches that they are liable only for a case similar to Shevu'as ha'Pikadon, i.e. when there is a claim of money (that must be paid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> If he said 'I impose an oath on you that you will testify for me after you will see testimony', perhaps they are liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span>  "V'Sham'ah Kol Alah v'Hu Ed" - he must already be a witness at the time of the oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he said in the synagogue 'I impose an oath on (all of) you... '</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Even if there are witnesses among them, they are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is, even if they are right by him they are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that this is like specifying them. Shmuel teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> If one saw a throng of people and witnesses were among them, and said 'I impose an oath on you that you will testify for me if you know testimony', perhaps they are liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Hu Ed" - he must specify the witnesses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps even if he said '(I impose an oath on) you that are standing here' they are exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Hu Ed" - since he specified the witnesses, they are liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> 'I impose an oath on you, Ploni and Almoni... '</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> If he said 'I impose an oath on you, Ploni and Almoni, that if you know testimony for me you will testify', and they heard testimony from another witness, or one of them was a relative or an invalid witness, perhaps they are liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Im Lo Yagid v'Nasa Avono" - the witnesses must be Kosher to testify.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He sent his slave...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> If he sent his slave to ask the witnesses to testify, or the defendant made them swear, perhaps they are liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Im Lo Yagid v'Nasa Avono" teaches that they are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the verse teach this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> The word 'Lo' is written with an 'Aleph' <i>and</i> 'Vav', suggesting that we read it both ways, 'Im Lo Lo Yagid (if he will not tell <i>to him</i>).'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE WORDING OF THE OATH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he said 'I impose an oath on you', (or) 'I command you', 'I forbid you', they are liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he made them swear by Heaven and earth, they are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he made them swear by any of the following, they are liable: 'Aleph-Dalet' (and 'Nun-Yud', the way we pronounce Hash-m's name'), 'Yud-Kei' (Rashi - Hash-m's four-letter name itself; Tosfos ha'Rosh - the first two letters of it), Shakai, Tzevakos, Chanun, Rachum, Erech Apayim, Rav Chesed, or any Kinuy (name that refers to Hash-m).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Meir says, one who curses Hash-m or his parents with any of these names is liable (Misas Beis Din);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Chachamim exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>One who curses himself or another person with any of these names transgresses a Lav;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>'Hashem should strike you (if you will not testify for me)' is the Alah (curse) that the Torah refers to;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Meir says, if he said 'Hashem should not strike you', 'Hashem should bless you', or 'Hashem should do good to you (if you will testify for me)', they are liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Chachamim exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the meaning of 'I impose an oath on you...'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> 'I impose an oath on you' refers to the oath mentioned in the Torah. 'I command you' refers to the command mentioned in the Torah (in the Parshah of vows). 'I forbid you' - refers to the Isur mentioned in the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> R. Chiya taught that if he said 'Kovalchem (I put you in fetters)', they are liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not find this expression in the Torah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> Rather, each of these expressions ('I impose an oath, I command, I forbid, I put you in fetters') is with an oath (and Hash-m's name).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE KODESH NAMES OF HASH-M</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> With 'Aleph-Dalet', 'Yud-Kei', Shakai, Tzevakos, Chanun, Rachum, Erech Apayim, Rav Chesed...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Chanun and Rachum are (Kodesh) names of Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> Some names of Hash-m may be erased. Other names that refer to Him may not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The following may not be erased - Kel, Eloka, Elokim, Elokeichem, Echyeh Asher Echyeh, 'Aleph-Dalet', 'Yud-Kei', Shakai, and Tzevakos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The following may be erased - ha'Gadol, ha'Gibor, ha'Nora, ha'Adir, ha'Chazak, ha'Amitz, ha'Izuz, Chanun, Rachum, Erech Apayim, and Rav Chesed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> In our Mishnah, he refers to the One Who is Chanun (gracious) or Rachum (merciful).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">35b----------------------------------------35b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If so, an oath 'by Heaven and earth' should be valid. He refers to 'the Owner of Heaven and earth'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> No. Nothing else is called Chanun (or Rachum), so surely he means 'the One Who is Chanun (or Rachum)';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Heaven and earth, he made them swear by Heaven and earth themselves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one wanted to write 'Elokim', once he writes 'Aleph-Lamed', these letters (are themselves a name of Hash-m. They are Kodesh, and they) may not be erased. The same applies to 'Yud-Kei' of Hash-m's name;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he wrote 'Shin-Dalet' from Shakai, ('Aleph-Dalet' from Adon-i - R. Chananel's text puts this in the previous clause, it may not be erased), or 'Tzadi-Beis' from Tzevakos, these letters may be erased;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, the entire word 'Tzevakos' may be erased, for it is not a name of Hash-m. It refers to Yisrael - "Tziv'osai Es Ami Vnei Yisrael."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Any letters appended to Hash-m's name, whether before or after it, may be erased;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If 'Lamed', 'Beis', 'Vav', 'Mem', 'Shin', 'Hei', or 'Kaf' is prefixed to Hash-m's name, it may be erased.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The letters 'Nun-Vav', 'Hei-Mem', or 'Chaf-Mem' suffixed to 'Elokei' may be erased.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Others say, letters suffixed may not be erased, because Hash-m's name that precedes them makes them Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The Halachah follows Others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>All the occurrences of Hash-m's name ('Aleph-Dalet') written regarding Avraham are Kodesh, except for "Adonai Im Na Matzasi Chen b'Einecha" (he was addressing the man (really, angel) in the middle).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Chanina ben Achi R. Yehoshua and R. Elazar ben Azaryah say, even this is Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Yehudah taught that hosting guests is greater than receiving the Divine Presence. Like whom is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like Chanina and R. Elazar. (Avraham interrupted speaking to Hash-m in order to host guests.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>The occurrences of 'Adonai' written regarding Lot are Chol. Only "Al Na (Hash-m)... Lehachayos Es Nafshi" is Kodesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He addressed Hash-m, Who can kill or keep alive.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>All the occurrences of Hash-m's name regarding Navos are Kodesh. Those regarding Michah are Chol;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer says, the names 'Yud-Kei' regarding Michah are Kodesh. The names 'Aleph-Lamed' are not, except for "Beis ha'Elokim b'Shilo."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>R. Eliezer says, all the occurrences of Hash-m's name written in the war against Binyamin are not Kodesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>R. Yehoshua says, they are Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> They cannot be Kodesh. Had Hash-m promised Bnei Yisrael victory, he would have fulfilled it (the first time)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Hash-m did not promise victory, for they did not ask about this, until the last time. (Then, He promised and fulfilled.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Every 'Shlomo' in Shir ha'Shirim refers to Hash-m (the Owner (or Maker) of Shalom), except for "ha'Elef Lecha Shlomo" - Shlomo had 1000 servants;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"U'Masayim l'Noterim Es Piryo" refers to Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Some say, also "Hinei Mitaso Shel Shlomo" is Chol.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel taught that a king who conscripts a sixth of the population for his work (Rashi; Tosfos - who kills a sixth of the world in optional wars; Rashba - who executes a sixth of his subjects) is not punished - "ha'Elef Lecha Shlomo" (1000 for Hash-m) and "u'Masayim l'Noterim Es Piryo" (200 for the king);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is not like either Tana (both agree that "ha'Elef Lecha Shlomo" is Chol)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, some say that "ha'Elef Lecha Shlomo" is Kodesh, and "Hinei Mitaso Shel Shlomo" is Chol. Shmuel holds like this latter Tana.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Every 'Malkiya' in Daniel is Chol, except for ('Melech' in) "Ant Malka <i>Melech</i> Malkaya..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>Some say, also the following is Kodesh - "Mari Chelma l'Sanach u'Fishrei l'Arach";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Daniel would not say this to Nebuchadnetzar, who hated Yisrael, for if so, Daniel would curse Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The first Tana holds that surely Nebuchadnetzar hated also some Nochrim (and Daniel cursed them).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MUST THE OATH INCLUDE HASH-M'S NAME?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he made them swear by any Kinuy of Hash-m, they are liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> It says (in Parshas Sotah) "l'Alah veli'Shevu'ah", but it already says "bi'Shvu'as ha'Alah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is extra to make a Gezerah Shavah to teach about 'Alah' written about Shevu'as ha'Edus. Just like the Alah of Sotah is a Shevu'ah with Hash-m's name, also that of Shevu'as ha'Edus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Resolution (Abaye):</span> That Beraisa is R. Chanina bar Idi (and our Mishnah is Chachamim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Chanina bar Idi):</span> The Torah commands to swear (Rashi - Shevu'as ha'Shomerim; R. Chananel - the oath of Sotah) and not to swear (falsely). It commands to curse (a Sotah), and not to curse (Hash-m or people);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like we are commanded to swear and curse with Hash-m's name, we are commanded not to swear and curse with Hash-m's name.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (They do not learn the Gezerah Shavah.) They learn that Alah is an oath as follows;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> 'Alah' means oath, as it says about a Sotah "v'Hishbi'a... bi'Shvu'as ha'Alah."</p>
