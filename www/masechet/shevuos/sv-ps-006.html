<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE ORDER OF BRIGHTNESS OF THE LESIONS OF TZARA'AS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that R. Akiva says that different appearances join together only when one is (directly) whiter than another (or Se'es with its secondary appearance)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> Yehoshua asked his father R. Akiva why Chachamim detailed the different appearances, and it did not suffice to say that k'Karom or above (whiter) is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> It was necessary to teach that the appearances join together.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Yehoshua:</span> Why didn't it suffice to say that anything k'Karom or above is Tamei, and the appearances join?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> This teaches that a Kohen cannot rule on Tzara'as unless he is an expert on the appearances and knows their names.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Yehoshua (who surely asked according to R. Akiva's opinion) thought it should suffice to say 'anything k'Karom or above is Tamei, and the appearances join.' He did not need to say <i>also</i> 'anything k'Sid or above is Tamei, and the appearances join'! (If he held that k'Sid joins with its primary appearance, he should have said so! Rashi - Rather, since both secondary appearances are derived from Se'es, it was clear that each joins with the appearance directly above it. Tosfos - surely Yehoshua also intended that the Mishnah would explicitly say that each joins with the appearance directly above it!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps Yehoshua meant that it should suffice to say that 'anything k'Karom or above is Tamei, and anything k'Sid or above is Tamei' (and each joins with its primary appearance, like Chachamim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This was obviously his intent. The Tana saw no need to elaborate!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chanina):</span> A parable explains R. Akiva's opinion of the appearances that join. There were four cups of milk. Two drops of blood fell into one cup, four drops fell in a second cup, eight drops in the third cup, 12 (some say - 16) fell in the fourth;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All appear white, but each is whiter than the next.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That shows only about mixed colors. Perhaps regarding pure colors, he holds like Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Since he holds like this regarding mixed colors, we may infer that the same applies to pure colors!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he really hold this way regarding mixed colors?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> Redness mixed in a Baheres looks like redness in k'Sid. Their color is like wine mixed with water;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The difference is in the white part. The white of the (mixed) Baheres is bright like snow, and the white of the (mixed) k'Sid is weaker.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If R. Akiva held that wool-white is second to Baheres, he should have said that the white of the (mixed) wool appearance is weaker than that of Baheres!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, he holds this way!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Noson):</span> R. Akiva did not say that the white of (mixed) k'Sid is weaker than that of Baheres, rather that the white of the (mixed) wool appearance is weaker than that of Baheres!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE DIFFERENT APPEARANCES OF TZARA'AS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to say that Baheres is the brightest?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Im Baheres Levanah Hi" - it is white, and nothing is as white as it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Baheres appears deeper (than the surrounding skin) - "u'Mareha Amok Min ha'Or", like a sunlit area appears deeper than the shade;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><i>Se'es</i> connotes elevation - "v'Al Kol ha'Geva'os ha'Nisa'os."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><i>Sapachas</i> connotes being subordinate - "v'Amar Sefacheni Na."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse shows that there is a secondary appearance to Se'es. What is the source for a secondary appearance to Baheres?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Zeira):</span> It says "Levanah" about Baheres, just like about Se'es;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like there is a secondary appearance to Se'es, also to Baheres.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> The Torah wrote "Sapachas" in between Se'es and Baheres to teach that there is a secondary appearance to each.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Se'es is like white wool.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Bivi):</span> It is clean wool of a newborn lamb that people cover (to keep it white) to use for Milas (soft wool).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> A parable explains Chachamim's opinion (of how appearances join). There were two kings, and each had a mayor under him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One king was above the other, and his mayor was above the other's. (I.e. one primary appearance is above the other and joins with it, and its secondary appearance is above the other's secondary appearance and joins with it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That is R. Akiva's opinion, that each appearance joins to the one above it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, each king is above his own mayor (i.e. each primary appearance joins with its secondary appearance).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ava):</span> A parable explains Chachamim's opinion (of how appearances join). A king (above) an Alkafta (a lesser king) (above) the king's mayor (above) the Alkafta's mayor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That is R. Akiva's opinion, that each appearance joins to the one above it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, the king is above his mayor, and the Alkafta is above his own mayor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> An example illustrates these two kings - Shevor Malka (king of Persia) and the Kaiser (of Romi).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> Which is the more important?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> "V'Seichul Kol Ara" (the last creature in Nebuchadnetzar's dream alludes to a kingdom that will destroy every land);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This is Romi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - (Ravina):</span> A parable explains Chachamim's opinion. A new wool garment is only slightly whiter than a new linen garment, but a worn out wool garment is much whiter than a worn out linen garment. (I.e. the primary appearances are very similar, but the secondary appearances are not.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - (Ravina):</span> A parable explains Chachamim's opinion. The difference in importance between new garments of wool and linen is small, but the difference in importance between worn garments of wool and linen is great.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TUMAH FOR WHICH ONE MUST BRING A KORBAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one knew of the Tum'ah, and later forgot...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> ("Nefesh Asher Tiga b'Chol Davar Tamei... Oh Chi Yiga b'Tum'as Adam" brings an Oleh v'Yored.) What is the source that the verses discuss one who entered the Mikdash or ate Kodshim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from the warnings and punishments for intentional transgressions of Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Kares (for Tum'ah) is only for one who enters the Mikdash or eats Kodshim (when he is Tamei). Likewise, the Korban for Tum'ah applies only to these two cases.</p>
